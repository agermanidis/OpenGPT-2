# gpt-2

Code and samples from the paper ["Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf).

For now, we have only released a smaller (117M parameter) version of GPT-2.

See more details in our [blog post](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/).

## Installation

Download the model data (needs [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)):
```
sh download_model.sh 117M
```

Install python packages:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Unconditional sample generation

| WARNING: Samples are unfiltered and may contain offensive content. |
| --- |

To generate unconditional samples from the small model:
```
python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py | tee samples
```
There are various flags for controlling the samples:
```
python3 src/generate_unconditional_samples.py --top_k 40 --temperature 0.7 | tee samples
```

While we have not yet released GPT-2 itself, you can see some unconditional samples from it (with default settings of temperature 1 and no truncation) in `gpt2-samples.txt`.

## Conditional sample generation

To give the model custom prompts, you can use:
```
python3 src/interactive_conditional_samples.py
```

## Future work

We may release code for evaluating the models on various benchmarks.

We are still considering release of the larger models.
