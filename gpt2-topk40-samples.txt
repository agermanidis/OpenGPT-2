Sydney's CBD is a "city of ghosts" due to years of "ghost building" on streets from Sydney Harbour Bridge to the M7, a new report has warned.

The report, by leading architectural firms SOM Architects and Studio N, also claims Australia's third largest city remains a "ghost city".

It cites the demolition of Sydney's Bankstown Town Hall as a prime example of why there's still a lot of work to do for what's become the fourth oldest city in the world in terms of population.

"The Sydney CBD is in desperate need of a complete transformation into a new city city. This will require billions of dollars of investment," the report says.<|endoftext|>Tutorials!

For those of you asking how do I get started in programming, you certainly don't have to look further! A great beginning to learn how to program comes in the form of Codecademy, a website that's been helping students around the world learn programming since 2013. What's exciting is that a student can start learning programming in less than three months.

To help you navigate the site and create your first program, I'm going to show you how to generate one. I'll also outline several different programming frameworks that you can use to build up your skills.

Step 1: Define Your Project

The first step is defining your code to build up a small game that your little sister will play. In your document or a word document, take a paragraph or two and write your desired program:

// 1. The title of the program! (This code doesn't really do anything; it just makes the title.)

Code the title of your program after "title of the program" like this and then type in your program. When you're done, you'll see what appears to be:

You should now be ready to import into your project any references you made in your document and use the "import the entire document" dropdown to import everything contained in your doc. Now, create one "module" type "HelloWorld" and add this line to your file's "before" block:

To save some typing, if you don't want to add a "before line," you can just delete the line after the module name (for example: "HelloWorld")

// 2. An example of a piece of code (This code does something. It's the main reason why you're here.):

In this example you can see how to "import" your module and type in your program for the first time. You can add more lines now as you get comfortable with it. The only thing you must always remember is to "export your module once." Once your program's completed for the first time, you can then export it in one of two ways:

The simplest way is to manually export everything like so:

You're welcome to use either of these solutions provided your code is in "public" folder for each line of your code. This is a feature of the C# language that allows you to place your programs in a "public" folder.

Or let's say you want to make a simple test:

In this case I'd export the whole folder:

So what does "export the entire folder" mean? It means you've now exported up to all of your .csproj folders, including your main project folder!

Step 3: Define Your "Initialization Code"

Now it's time to start really defining your first step in programming, which is "Initialization Code." You would do this in your project.json file, and it is a very important step that determines what type of initialization code your program will have on the first time your program is run. It's also used to make sure that your program doesn't run if the program, or any of the classes, are already loaded into memory before your program begins execution.

// 3. In the Initialization section below:

You're looking for some "Initialization Code." All initialization code must have exactly three lines of initialization code, with the first line being the "InitializeComponent" line. It will also have one single line "LoadLibrary" line.

In our "Init" section, we're going to add "InitializeComponent." So from here on, we're going to put that line at the top of our files and then add "LoadLibrary" after it (to have it be the last line in the file) as we continue to define our first steps in our programs!

InitializeComponent:

LoadLibrary:


Here's what it will look like when we do things the way we described:

Step 4: Start Visual Studio Code

If you've already downloaded Visual Studio Code, we're going to go ahead and add another command line window to our terminal (as we'll be

The first-ever U.S. Olympic rugby sevens team is set to compete with China and Japan in the first of three games in Rio this August.

The team, selected by USA Rugby, will play at Suntec Events Center Stadium with China and Japan in what the world's most popular sport is likely to view as the last game of the Olympic Games, according to USA Rugby CEO Nigel Melville.

"It has long been a question whether or not we would make another Olympic effort," Melville said. "It is the right time to take a look at what we can do to bring the Olympic Games back to the United States.

"We think it is the right time, and we will do so and be back in the Olympic fold, and I expect to be."

The team will take on the Asian teams in what Melville said is the final team for this year's competition. He said it will be tough, but "it is one of the few games this year with a significant national presence. In many ways, it is the last opportunity for U.S. national team members to make an impression on the world."

The USA took home silver in rugby sevens in Rio last summer, while Australia finished a close second to the U.S. in the medal count. Melville said that was a result of good performances by the teams, and the U.S. needs to learn lessons from their losses.

"I think we have to learn how we play, and we're trying to do that better at this early stage of any game. I understand we didn't do that well in the London Olympics, and it's a reason we finished second to Australia," Melville told ESPN in an interview. "But in Rio it's a different game plan that was executed really, really well.

Melville said the USA could have put the game in the hands of the Chinese, and the Australians, by just sticking to the plan and going forward.

"It's like the football team. The game is designed to allow the players to make their own impact on the game by going and making the tackle, or scoring a try, or throwing in some key passes, and then the rest of our time, the rest of the game's going to come at us. They've seen that from the last game against the Chinese. So we really have to learn what we did right and do the same this time. You can't make a huge impact right from the start."

"You have to understand that you can't play this game like we did in London. We didn't start play. This is not the plan for this game. We've been studying them since September, watching, preparing, going through the process of how you play a rugby sevens game with a national team that's made up of sevens players."

USAR has had other meetings with various players about possibly competing with the Chinese at Rio, but Melville said so far all have said they wanted to play for their countries.

"Some of these guys have made it clear they want to play for their countries and, if given an opportunity, they'll play for their countries," Melville said. "One thing the Chinese have got is experience from the last Olympic Games. They know how to do it.

"They've put it behind them. They understand how the game works."

Melville added that the idea of playing both the U.S. and Australia, as well as the Chinese, is still being determined. The only other options are to play an American team or two Americans.

"They had some players in the pool that spoke Chinese or English, and we thought it would be fun to have a Chinese team, to have some Australian players and see if they could communicate," Melville said.

There is no specific time frame for selection of a team, Melville said. But the top finishers will play on Aug. 28, while the winners of a qualifying tournament on Aug. 29 and 30 will advance.

Melville said he will name a U.S. coach "as soon as I can." He declined to name names, though he did say Ryan Bailey, one of the coaching staffs during the Beijing Olympics, is under consideration.

Melville also was asked about the possible involvement of a U.S. Rugby affiliate.

"That is a question to be answered to the full extent of our ability. Right now, the only affiliation we are looking at is one that I'm a part of in the U.S. Olympic Committee and I'm a part of the USA Rugby board of directors. I really don't know the answer to that for now," Melville said. "I was asked the question by a number of people. There will be more to come in the next month on that subject, but right now it's a question that is probably best handled by the full leadership of the U.

LARAMIE, Wyo. -- The New Orleans Pelicans are headed overseas for the third straight season.

A source told ESPN New Orleans that the Pelicans have assigned starting point guard Jrue Holiday to his country's team, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.

Holiday had one game this season and averaged 3.5 points in 12.5 minutes over one start after missing nearly six weeks following foot surgery, and is not expected to play Tuesday.

Holiday is one of five players the Pelicans are set to send overseas to fill out training camp rosters. They also sent forward Jason Smith and center Brian Roberts to France for preseason games against the Lakers on Aug. 2 and against the Philadelphia 76ers on Aug. 6.

Smith appeared in 32 games for New Orleans this season, averaging 7.2 points in 37 minutes. He signed earlier this offseason.

Roberts appeared in five games for New Orleans this season -- recording three points in 13 minutes. He is currently sidelined with a sprained ankle.

The Pelicans said Saturday in a statement that they "strongly encourage all players to participate in the NBA preseason and international games."<|endoftext|>I was just watching the new episode of The Simpsons and noticed this joke about how the Simpsons are always going to be a family of four and how they always run into each other in a restaurant but never really talk to each other. This has been going on since the very first episode where Lisa was forced to be Lisa and Marge was forced to be Marge and Homer was forced to be Homer without a thought.

Here's the joke:

Lisa: "When it comes to a family, we're the same species!"

Marge: "Oh, come off it, you're not as smart as she is."

Lisa: "I'm getting there!"

Marge: "It's like she's never been inside a family."

Lisa: "I don't know how I feel about that!"

Marge: "She's your sister!"

Lisa: "I was just saying that we're all one big family, Marge."

Marge: "Oh well! Let's see! What would a family even look like if we had four of us?"

They end up at the family meal and have nothing in common. The four eat together anyway.<|endoftext|>The National Security Agency is asking to be exempted from an existing law on surveillance so it can continue to collect the phone data and Internet communications of Americans, according to sources familiar with the situation and legal documents.

NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers had previously requested the exemption in exchange for greater access to data, but the Justice Department turned the request down, citing its concerns about its legality, the sources said. The new proposal is expected to be submitted on Monday to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., according to one official.

The source described the change, which will require congressional approval, as the latest attempt by Congress to prevent the NSA from expanding its powers.

The move comes amid an intense public debate over the NSA and its surveillance powers after documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden revealed how the agency has amassed vast quantities of telephone and Internet information from Americans.

The Associated Press reported this month that the program called PRISM collects data by hacking directly into the servers of nine companies that hold the records, collecting the information of both Americans and foreigners.

The NSA, which said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) in December that it does not collect data "about millions of Americans," argues that the program is legal because it does not target people in the U.S. The Justice Department and intelligence and defense committee chairs have repeatedly supported the surveillance, saying it is critical to preventing terrorism and foreign espionage.

Admiral Rogers, a veteran of the U.S. Navy, is in the final months of his tenure as NSA director and wants to maintain a tight grip on one of the most sensitive programs in the history of the agency. In recent weeks, the White House and other officials have defended the program, insisting it is critical in the fight against terrorism, even though the NSA itself has said its collection of private data is not relevant to its main function of monitoring communications of terror suspects.

Mr. Holder, asked about the NSA proposal in a recent meeting with lawmakers, said he could not comment on the details.

"Well, I have not had a chance to review at all the new proposal," he said.

Lawmakers are preparing new legislation to increase oversight of the agency. But any reform proposal is likely to receive strong opposition from the NSA and other intelligence officials.

Adm. Rogers declined an interview request for this story. In a statement, he said: "The NSA is not monitoring the communications of Americans and most of the information about what phone calls take place between our two countries are intercepted by foreigners overseas, overseas, overseas."

Description

Thanks to you, the Illidari have lost the power of fel magic. However, you should be ashamed of yourself. Fel has always been the dark side, but it is now lost forever.

We can still use the dark power to destroy the Legion. We have learned how to do so, but it's just a matter of time before the Legion is ready to attack again.

You should do your best to learn the dark arts. We're confident you will succeed and destroy the Illidari once and for all.

Proximity

This section concerns content related to Cataclysm.

The Illidari have now left the surface. They have taken control of Felwood in Northrend.

Notes

After completing Felwood (for both Alliance and Horde factions) he/she'll be a member of the Illidari at Felwood.

The Illidari can take over your server via [Dreadscar Rift], if you have the [Aldor's Signet] in your inventory and have been to Felwood.

If player is an [Illidari Champion] When the Illidari come, all champions of the <Class> must stand together. All will be judged, and the guilty will receive the greatest punishment, the death of any champion. There are many, many things left to learn about the Illidari. In one way, you are in the right place... you stand under the command and protection of the great Illidari -- and you are a champion of the Legion. Even so, you must show the greater good and sacrifice everything but your sanity. This is a terrible thing to do, but it is necessary. Do not be one of those who think that it is too hard... or who ask for too little. That path will lead to damnation. You must go back to the Shadow Council -- and to Gul'dan. You will show them why you are the greatest champion the World of Warcraft has ever known.

You must go home to Shadowmoon Valley and destroy Gul'dan.

The Illidari has taken control of Felwood in Northrend. The Legion has risen again. The Burning Legion has taken control of this place. With Gul'dan's return, the demons will return.

Kilrogg Deadeye is one of the main characters of Warcraft: The Beginning, a story told through a series of cutscenes. The first story to be told, it takes place in Shadowmoon Valley after the Cataclysm, and the beginning of the expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, it takes place before the Cataclysm. Kilrogg is one of the leaders within the Alliance resistance against the Horde onslaught.

Kilrogg was played by Chris Metzen in the cinematic cutscenes for the Cataclysm expansion, where he led the assault upon Stormwind Keep (which was overrun by the forces of Ner'zhul) only for the remaining defenders to flee in fear due to the sudden appearance of a massive Scourge army. The cinematic also features a flashback to Kilrogg personally battling the Lich King before leaving to help his comrades defend the world.<|endoftext|>This page is part of © FOTW Flags Of The World website

The Finnish flag features the national emblem of Finland and a red band at each corner. The red band is slightly bent towards the hoist and is divided in red with a blue "Pusan" border between them. The coat of arms of Finland is placed with the blue border at the hoist end of the red band.

The coat of arms of Finland (see picture) consists of three quarters of a shield with the legend in a shield design with the eagle, two coats of arms on a shield, surrounded by the words "Pusan" and "Finnish Freedom", the arms of Pusan. There are the arms of the Kingdom of Finland with a golden crown to the center (the crown, as an eagle, symbolically represents Finland's sovereignty and independence) with the

So I thought of that very same little boy in a way the entire world should know about him.


He is only two years old now, but he has his very own dinosaur: an awesomely cool mini-version of his favorite dinosaur.

To him, this is exactly the kind of thing that every other Disney movie has done before him, and that makes it even more special to him. I mean, he doesn't even know who's making dinosaurs as it is. He just has to have that one. I guess he would say that because we all think about these things when we're little, and he's going to be that little kid for the rest of his life.<|endoftext|>The US presidential election has given new impetus to the debate over whether the world needs nuclear weapons. Since the US has more weapons than any other nation, we have to decide if such weapons are justified for our security and whether they actually keep us safe. The United States currently possesses an estimated arsenal of approximately 6,700 nuclear weapons–more than the combined forces of the next 20 nations combined, and many times the total used by the eight nations with nuclear weapons at the start of the Cold War.

For more than 50 years, the US has been under the threat of nuclear attacks. If a nuclear attack occurred today, it's estimated that half of the population living in this country would be killed or injured. So how does the US stand up to this kind of threat? Let's take a look at three major arguments:

First, nuclear weapons are so reliable that the United States can respond in under minutes to any attack with nukes. The current nuclear arsenal is comprised mostly of fission-weapons (such as the US weapons that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki). While this might be a tempting narrative, it falls apart when you examine the reality.

For example, the Soviet Union had an inventory of roughly 15 to 20 thermonuclear weapons. They also had the Soviet ICBM complex that had the capacity to deliver the equivalent of 30,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic warheads. Furthermore, the Soviets had a military capability well beyond the capabilities of America's nuclear bombers, whose range is about 9,000 miles. This led to the US having to wait nearly a week to launch nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union first attacked with its first strike. The Soviet "solution" would have been to launch at least 50 nuclear weapons in the first few minutes, which would have wiped out a great deal of humanity.

The Soviets had a military capability well beyond the capabilities of America's nuclear bombers

Even if the US did have a perfect response, what's the probability of stopping a nuclear missile with nukes? In reality, our ability to stop a nuclear missile with nukes is low. If a Russian ICBM were to have a successful first strike, they would likely hit their target even if we only had four ICBMs.

Moreover, the current US ICBM force is largely obsolete, with only two aging ICBMs (the Minuteman IIIB and Minuteman IIIH), as well as the B61 nuclear bomb and strategic ABM (anti-ballistic missile) system.

These weapons are also expensive, and if we choose not to continue to replace them, they will soon be retired. The B61 bomb costs $8 million each, while the strategic ABM system costs a reported $10 billion. A new, "operationally deployable" Minuteman III is estimated to cost $3.5 billion each. Given these numbers, it's clear that the current ICBM force is not a feasible deterrent for America, and that the United States must have both a replacement and upgrading program for its deployed force to remain viable. Thus, the argument is clearly not that nuclear weapons are perfect.

To this day, the US is still not able to stop a major nuclear warhead from detonating near its surface, either with an ICBM, conventional ICBM or ballistic missile (which will come at some point in the future). In order to defend against a "precision strike" with an ICBM, the US must either be able to destroy the incoming warhead or at least destroy it before it comes to the ground (or launch a counterattack).

However, the United States does have two kinds of ICBMs that can knock out an incoming warhead at a fairly safe distance. One is the B61, which is a very long-range nuclear weapon that will destroy the incoming warhead with a few seconds of time. (The US has two such weapons in its arsenal.) However, the US only has a single ICBM on hand for use in a "precision strike." A two-warhead ICBM, such as the B61, also gives the US the ability to destroy incoming nuclear warheads at a much longer distance. But this is not an option because

I recently acquired this bike from its original owner. It has always been a good bike in every regard, but I found some problems along the way: It has some wear and tear on the engine bay, the front end has been modified to a wider track and the suspension was modified as well. The bike has been running very well, and the engine is still working perfectly (I have changed oil and filters and both of my oil changes since acquiring this bike).

The bike is still in working order and it has all the original items including the oil filter. I am giving this kz1000 a thorough overhaul with a complete overhaul in the oil system and front end as well as some complete brakes and exhaust work.

As a side project, I also have a very old motorbike that is a great engine swap to take these bikes to the next level.<|endoftext|>There's been talk of a 'recovery' for months now but it appears that it's finally here… so what exactly was happening in the UK and what's the current status there?

As mentioned earlier, there has been a dramatic slump in the housing sector and with prices now crashing into the basement it's probably inevitable that the recovery is about to enter the phase of "panic" before it really recovers.

Here's a quick rundown of the key sectors and what is happening there.

Rents are coming down (the picture that the media paints) and yet property agents are only now starting to come to grips with this. As a result there is a massive drop-off in home-price growth and many property agents fear that we are on the verge of a price bubble like the one in America in the early 2000s. A few months ago house prices and rents seemed almost identical, even at current low interest rates and they weren't far off for much longer. But rents are now starting to go up again… and this is only going to speed up the inevitable crash, and this time we know with certainty that the crash will be as rapid as the recovery from the financial crisis. The fact that there is actually a lot less overhang in places like London and the South East than there was five years ago is proof that we've had a massive decline in housing demand. This means that many of the thousands of people who are being forced to give up on ever buying a home will instead simply be renting until prices drop even further. I suspect the big banks will also start to get worried at the end of this. Some property experts see a future for property investment which is similar to that which existed prior to the crash in 2007-08. This means that if home prices don't come down fast enough then you can have a similar crash in the property stocks of most banks.

The other issue (which is more important than the housing sector) is that people are starting to look at their retirement savings and realise that they will have less to live on – and even if you've accumulated some savings over the course of your working life (and remember that savings are made over time) this will inevitably reduce the real value of that savings over time. So much of that wealth that you've amassed over many years will now be in the form of assets other than your mortgage. The other issue (and it's probably the most important issue of all) is that there's a huge overhang of unfunded liabilities and pension debts which means that we need to put up much larger public debts if the economy is going have any hope of recovering any time soon. So the government needs to start working very fast to start funding its debts again which will require a massive increase in the debt ceiling.

A quick update on the eurozone: I haven't been seeing a lot of news around this lately as everybody seems so focused on the UK economy but I have a feeling that the crisis is actually now on another scale…

The financial industry and big banks have been getting nervous and a lot of European countries (particularly the southern European countries, like Spain and Italy) have just become too expensive to do business in.

Many of the banks in these countries are already under-capitalised and this really won't get better in the near future. There's no guarantee that they will just be able to survive as any other bank would over the coming years.

What will make things even more difficult is the fact that there are a lot of other businesses that they compete against for business… and many of these businesses are even more dependent on government support – especially the utilities. There's a very real potential that they could go bankrupt within the next 12 months. In other words, we haven't learned our lessons after the financial crisis (aside from being too generous to bankers). And I'm pretty sure that is what is going to happen in these parts of Europe now.

If we look at the real estate sector, the UK has some incredibly rich land but that's about it. It's not the UK's economy and it certainly doesn't seem

The National Security Agency reportedly used data from the American cellphone records program to identify the whereabouts of an Iranian-American man in San Francisco.

The man, Anwar al-Aulaqi, 26, who is believed to be an al Qaeda operative, told The Associated Press he was arrested on July 11 at a hotel in Oakland, Calif. because agents believed he could have been a terrorist. Aulaqi was freed on Aug. 10 after an unsuccessful appeal to the federal appeals court.

Aulaqi said the data were collected as part of the NSA's secret program of collecting global phone data. He said that although he had been in Saudi Arabia and Yemen for months and had no connection to either country, the NSA agents picked him up. During a 10-hour interrogation, agents seized his laptop and thumb drives. He told his lawyer that the information was used for terrorism-related cases.

It's also all about a great looking recipe. The Toblerone recipe on the box is the perfect recipe for breakfast, as they're topped off with a chocolate ganache – although there are a few variations available to get even more flavour.

We thought we'd make a special treat to show that you don't need a high-end chocolate to recreate the perfect Toblerone.

We've made a batch with just 40 calories per gram and they're packed with rich goodness. These Toblerones are also very versatile. You can make a recipe simply the same all day with the same ingredients but, if you would like something even richer, simply leave out the rum and the milk on your morning recipe and top with a decadent, chocolate ganache.

The Perfect Toblerone

Ingredients 50g dark chocolate

1 tbsp milk

1 tsp vanilla extract

1 cup butter (melted)

1/2 tsp rum or triple sec (optional)

Instructions 1. Melt the chocolate (in a heatproof bowl or pan over a saucepan of boiling water) until it spreads. If it starts to melt slightly too quickly, pour to the sieve and allow to cool for 5 minutes before pouring straight into the fridge to solidify.

2. Cream the butter and add the rum, then the vanilla, and then gradually mix in your melted chocolate mixture.

3. Once all the chocolate's mixed in, turn up the heat to low and allow to cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the chocolate is all melted and smooth. It is important to stir constantly to prevent the chocolate from splattering.

4. Spread the melted chocolate over the cake, and then top with a dusting of cocoa powder.

5. Place back into the fridge for around an hour to harden down.

I want to lay that argument down.

GamerGate was the product of a number of factors. The first was that the industry itself, like most technology industries, has a pretty conservative bias, especially in regards to female representation. That has been the case since the earliest days when video game designers and publishers were largely just trying to cash in on an increasing mainstream interest in gaming (i.e. the "Nintendogs" craze before the PC explosion of the '90s). That was amplified during the PC revolution when gamers, particularly male gamers, had more freedom to choose what games they played, and there were more platforms to play them on.

The mainstreaming of consoles like the PlayStation and the Xbox had also allowed game designers to make much more personal, focused games featuring their own characters rather than generic male archetypes, and that in-turn allowed a new audience to discover those kinds of games — both boys and girls.

Then, with the advent of social media when most gamers, men and women, became more open about their interests (again, including the "Nintendogs" craze) and their desires to game, the audience for those kinds of titles widened to include everyone. With that happened, the industry as a whole had to be more realistic in its designs on attracting players who weren't just geeks looking for a video game to play.

GamerGate was thus formed as a response to these trends — first by those gamers who wanted better representation of women and the underrepresented gender in games,

Live blog highlights: None here

For Rutgers: New head coach Chris Ash takes over the program after one season in which he had a 10-17 record, a 5-7 mark in Big Ten play and an NCAA loss after a loss to Wisconsin, and finished with a 12-32 record. While many have pointed out that Rutgers has won just seven games in each of the last three seasons, new coach Ash has his work cut out for him to prove that he can replace the talent that departed (and departed for other programs). The Scarlet Knights still have five seniors on their roster, including All-American receiver Leonte Carroo, a Heisman finalist last year. The offensive line needs to be rebuilt, and while the defense is returning eight starters, it will need to pick up all the pieces from last season.

For Texas: Strong, coming off his third 10-win season, inherits a program that has struggled for years and is looking at the rebuilding process again. While Texas certainly returns at least two of its starting five from last season, replacing that depth will be key. The passing game still needs to be rebuilt, and the offense will need to have a lot of success with a new quarterback, a position group that only had four starters return, including a likely starter in Shane Buechele. The defense will lose about half of its front, but the front seven is one of the best in the country. This is Texas' one chance to prove that they are capable of reaching the postseason each season.

Prediction


For Rutgers: Another Big Ten victory and Rutgers will be in a spot to play for the conference title.

for Texas: Texas just has to slow down Rutgers' offense in this one and Rutgers' defense doesn't have the personnel to hold up against Texas' prolific offense.

What can we learn about Rutgers from this game?

1) Rutgers really will need to take it on the road against a team from the Big 12 after their two wins came against the spread in Iowa and Minnesota.

2) Rutgers' offense will need to step up at some point. The defense must continue to improve because you can make a case that Texas doesn't have a defense with the ability to stop Rutgers on Saturday.

3) Texas will not be able to rely on freshman Daje Johnson to get the ball to playmakers and get the ball moving on a consistent basis.

4) Texas will need sophomore QB Shane Buechele to help take the pressure off the defense to find a way to get into the end zone.

5) The key for Notre Dame to beat Notre Dame will be the play of QB Everett Golson. Golson had a rough first game against the Irish in 2014 and took the blame for throwing three interceptions. In his second game, Golson has been more patient and is making better decisions, which has led to his higher completion percentage and fewer interceptions. With Golson under center, Notre Dame has been getting into the end zone and scoring points. Even if Golson can't play, I think the offense can still be effective.

Prediction: Rutgers 14, Texas 10

— North Carolina lawmakers are pushing to expand Medicaid in the state – a potentially costly proposition that would cover a greater percentage of the state's uninsured population than it currently does.


The legislature passed a Medicaid expansion bill late last month, but Gov. Bev Perdue has not committed to signing it and is awaiting the final legislation to be approved by a state Senate conference committee.

"Gov. Perdue has made clear she's open to expanding Medicaid but she wants it to be paid for with existing federal dollars and that's what's stalled the bill this

"The president wants to be able to make a deal. But we have to know. We have to know now the scope of the problem, because at this point a single meeting is not going to solve it, is certainly not going to make a difference. The issue of Iran is so much bigger than just the issue of negotiating, because if the Iranians take the country over, things will change very, very rapidly, much faster than anyone envisioned." — Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, James Jeffrey to the Financial Times

The President needs to know the scope of how difficult or simple it will be to solve this nuclear situation, so he can help inform the debate, especially if the deal isn't perfect from the American perspective or the international community (and if, God forbid, Iran takes over.)

"In the coming week or so the president will sit down with President [Reince] Priebus as well as Secretary [John] Kerry, with both of them, to discuss the options he's got and where he'd like to take this country." — State Department Spokesperson Marie Harf

While we don't know everything at this point, the President and his team have to be willing to try new things and be open to alternative options. Obama wants to take the "best possible deal" in order to have a strong economy, and we'd like to help with that end.

Iran

Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapon, and it is a country that has a lot of good and bad things going for it. It has been under sanctions for many years and has made some changes, but it continues to have nuclear ambitions and is still a potential source of weapons-grade material.

Iran's main goal may be to be seen as a good neighbor for the region, for the United States, and for Israel. The fact that the US has been willing support both Iran as well as Israel has caused some rumblings with the Iranians.

The United States has the power to pressure Iran economically, and could even sanction them financially. The United States could also do some other things, like try some economic or military coercion over Iran. While we would prefer a peaceful outcome, we would not stand idly by and let any potential nuclear weapons going to a country that could do such a thing.

If Iran were to become a nuclear power, it would be a major problem. But it is more unlikely than it has ever been to happen at this point. We could have an argument about how many nuclear weapons Iran could potentially have (it has around a thousand for a number of reasons.) But given the many other problems in the region right now, we think it is more likely that this would become a more complex problem than it ever was.

This could all come down to trust, trust that the President is in control, and trust that the international community and the United States will all act together to solve this problem.<|endoftext|>This month marks 25 years since Dr. Seuss published "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish," the book that kick-started an endless stream of kids' picture books, and one of the most popular children's literature classics ever published. The book is considered the cornerstone of the field of picture writing. The author of the book, Dr. Seuss's daughter, Susie Seuss Geisel, had one simple message for all those kids who loved to write: you don't need to be a doctor or an author to work in children's literature. "I was a writer myself," Geisel said when she was asked to help explain her father's work. "But you know he didn't tell me to write a book, I had to be a writer."

Here are nine of the best books written by young children. Whether you're a little kid who's just starting to write a manuscript of your own or a grown-up who's curious about a budding author, there's plenty to enjoy in here.

One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Lark Walker. This book tells the story of three fish called "R" through "L." The first fish is named "R" while the second fish is named "L." Together their names form a rhyme that says "Two fish, two red fish, blue fish all together!"

Cristiano Ronaldo wants to spend his retirement with Real Madrid, and while his agent believes that any interest of the Premier League is just a tactic that the club want, the forward appears unconcerned about his future

Cristiano Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes has denied reports that Manchester United are willing to pay £55m for his client.

Speculation about a transfer had surrounded the 27-year-old this week and Real Madrid had even been said to have launched a lawsuit against Real's Spanish newspaper, AS, over the leak.

"I have no information on that subject," Mendes told BBC Sport.

"I don't know anything about it whatsoever, you can imagine that if someone told me that, I would not have believed it."

Ronaldo, Real Madrid's record goalscorer, has scored a total of 323 league goals over the past nine years for the Spanish champions.<|endoftext|>You've decided to do your own thing with a new camera or an idea you have. If you're going it alone and you don't have the financial backing to hire one of the big name companies (if you can even afford them), then you may need to have that camera on your body for the time being.

The best way to do this is probably to rent a DSLR on some of the rental sites (if you can pay them). They'll be able to help to find the best quality and features the camera will need for the tasks that you have in mind with your camera. Once you get over the excitement of the idea of this all starting, it can be an incredibly helpful tool both for your new endeavor and to help out someone else, so be sure get to it!

Now, here's what we have at the moment at B&H.

The F2 Pro

The F2 Pro is a camera that is meant specifically for filmmakers, not photographers. The camera offers a very different approach to filmmaking, and at a price point that's a lot of bang for your buck. This is a camera that's made for serious photographers, but has enough features and specs to help make your daily shooting and editing process on a DSLR just as easy as it is if you're using your smartphone and a decent tripod.

The camera is certainly more capable of working at high ISO speeds and has better quality than most consumer level DSLRs. There are some quality improvements from when Foveon came out to how that sensor functions, and that certainly adds to the look and feel of the camera.

There are some pretty cool stuff coming out in the coming camera updates. Here are some of them (and some new camera samples on youtube).

The F2 Pro comes with a very nice set of extra features. The new firmware will offer improved manual options, a zoom mode, and even "full frame" stabilization. This is something that's been mentioned before on this site, but should be especially important for DSLR shooters, who need help getting a DSLR "down to size" to make the most of their camera.

The camera is a great choice for folks who want to get started with film or just want to learn. This camera is also perfect for those that like to travel (I myself take it with me very often). The F2 Pro offers an extremely versatile range of feature sets, and it's not hard to see why it's so popular with its small, light, and small size.

======================================== SAMPLE 11 ========================================
For almost 40 years, one of the biggest things about American television and radio has been the presence of the nation's most popular celebrity host, the late David Letterman. It's clear that while many of us have grown accustomed to Letterman, few have gotten to know him in depth. That might be changing thanks to a recent, stunning New York Times piece in its Sunday magazine.

In what's probably the most thorough interview Letterman has given in years, the comedian and veteran actor reveals a lot of new details about his life and work in his first interviews about the current state of his brain, and a lot of things that were kept secret for decades. The piece is longish, but worth reading on all levels.

Here are a few highlights:

On Alzheimer's: "It starts as a disease of the memory and ends with you feeling tired and like a bum. You can be a total amoeba."

On why he changed his diet: "I decided to get a little bit leaner. My wife's mother-in-law had me put on some weight because she thought her son-in-law was too fat; he didn't know how to keep his weight on. We talked about the relationship between weight and dementia and the idea of a certain metabolic rate of the body. I changed my diet. Now I'm the opposite of fat; now I'm the opposite of lean, but not by a lot. I am actually very skinny, but that's what happens."

On the way his work on The Late Show affected his life: "When I was doing Late Night, a little of my friends saw me as a little boy. They said "What the hell are you doing when I get older?' I never thought of myself that way! When I came back to work after being off for a while, I was actually happier than I ever had been in my whole life. That was a huge change for me: to really feel happy and to have my relationships with people."

On why he left CBS in 1998: "I was getting very sick and tired of the politics and the whole thing that was going down in the CBS building, and the whole kind of power structure around the network. I made a point to just leave, and at the end of the season there was this feeling that it was time to go. I was sitting in my office, looking around, and I remember walking into the door and thinking 'You know what else is going to go down tonight? A meteor will hit the earth, and that's going to be the day. So go! It's time to go.' And of course, they canceled The X-Files, and that was that."

On the value of keeping secrets: "I don't worry about my legacy when I die, I worry about my legacy and what my kids will remember. So I think that's the way it should be all the time."

On the reason he chose to stay away from Hollywood in his 90s: "[Comics] and writers and actors used to be an endangered species. I thought it was time to find out that people loved this stuff. And if we're going to say we were there, let's just name who we were. That changed things for a while, and then, well, the thing that happened was The Simpsons came out. There are a lot more comics, and now there's a TV show called The Walking Dead, which is a good show."

This is a must-read interview that I didn't read when it came out but am glad we had it later. Not to say Letterman wouldn't talk about anything: In a 2010 interview, he's asked if he's changed and doesn't hold back: "What I think about is I feel like my life is just about right now, and when I die I will be the same person that I am right now, and then nothing else will affect it in the same way."

This is the sort of thing that Letterman would say: "I will miss the show, but nothing can replace the magic."<|endoftext|>Brisbane Roar announced on Tuesday the signing of talented young Australian-born Socceroos utility Mathew Leckie from Central Coast Mariners until the end of the Hyundai A-League 2016/17 season.

======================================== SAMPLE 12 ========================================
It is a strange thing, but the fact remains that in 2016 we are entering the last year of the Obama presidency. The next president will have at least three and probably four years of the Obama presidency, as he will be out of office by that point. How is this possible? It's not even clear that we will want to get a lot of things right after all that we have learned.

I have said that the Obama presidency is not over yet. If Obama were to step down before his successor takes the oath—for whatever reason—the legacy of President Barack Obama will not be destroyed. Obama still has the opportunity to play a very important role in our future by being one of the last remaining statesmen.

I wish Obama well. I wish him the best of luck. But I also wish the president did not believe so strongly after his election in 2008 that he could be some kind of savior and do all things on his own. President Obama's legacy should be one of pragmatism, and the realization that we must work with others to achieve our goals. That's exactly why the Obama presidency is over. It may not seem like it. But to the extent that any part of his legacy survives, it would be because he worked to make his legacy work for everyone.

In this election, Barack Obama's legacy came as a disappointment to Donald Trump. A lot of people were frustrated at the Obama administration for its overly complex immigration policy, its unwillingness to speak of terrorism in a way that the public could understand, and its general incompetence.

But if we want to really understand why so many Americans cast their votes against the very idea of Hillary Clinton, the most important lesson to take away is that Donald Trump is a very weak messenger of the presidency.

When Trump went after Bill Clinton's history of "sexual assault," Clinton's response was to attack Trump. When Trump made false claims about Clinton's past sexual history—even though this is a common tactic used by Republicans looking to impeach Clinton—Clinton did not attack Trump until he finally issued his own accusation.

I don't blame the Clinton campaign for reacting like this. But when Clinton accused Trump of being a "sexual predator," the Clinton campaign had no reason to defend its own candidate. If Trump is a sexual predator, there is no valid reason for Clinton to keep saying and doing the same thing. All he has done about that is reinforce Trump's message that women who have gotten raped and beaten deserved it.

We did not need Donald Trump to win the presidency. We did not need Hillary Clinton to win the presidency. These are two of the weakest messenger candidates in American history. If we cannot have confidence in them as presidents, then we have no confidence in our democracy. The fact that Donald Trump cannot seem to imagine what it would be like to actually be president should be a cause of concern for everybody.

And even if Trump wins, will he be able to do anything? One of the big surprises to Americans of this election was the ease that some Trump supporters were using the power of social media to communicate with one another. As Trump supporters were bombarding his opponent's Facebook pages and Twitter accounts with messages, Clinton's campaign took these posts and used the same ones to respond. But even without those tools at their disposal, Clinton's team was more effective at coordinating its communications and trying to organize.

Facebook, which has an algorithm that determines what is and is not news, can no doubt be used for good. But Clinton will have no monopoly on the future of politics on Facebook. And without some kind of centralized mechanism to organize and to communicate—whether Facebook, or Twitter or Reddit—the idea of a Trump presidency is just an absurdly unrealistic threat. The reason Trump and Clinton have become the most disliked and distrusted presidential candidates in American history is not because Americans don't trust them even when they're lying about things like policy (see here and here for examples of this). It's because their platforms are so weak that people cannot resist their messages without losing control over themselves.

It's time for Donald Trump to learn to run a campaign, not a presidency. And that, perhaps, is the most depressing thing about this election: he doesn't ever seem to want to learn.<|endoftext|>The government's response to a public health crisis is supposed to be to do something. And the answer to the Ebola crisis is to do nothing.

The president's response has been to get a bunch of people out of Africa and let them die.

His answer to the ongoing plague in the Mideast has been to send in a bunch of people who've never been to Africa to fight the plague.

This is what the administration, from top to bottom, has done:

1) Do nothing.

The Obama administration has done nothing to stop the epidemic spreading and has done nothing to stop more people from dying.

This is the result:

1,427 people have been infected with Ebola

I'm trying to figure out a way to install a new application. First I do a fresh install using a virtual machine from scratch. This is successful, I get the application to install and it's working. But it shows me this and then the screen below:

When I run the new application there are these errors:

The user running the application has an account with the same name as the virtual machine.

The virtual machine is a copy of the physical machine.

The version of the application installed and its version matches the version of the virtual machine.

This might be a problem. How might I run that application with the user from the virtual machine?

Edit: After running into this problem it did not seem to have been affecting the virtual machine it was installed on. So the solution isn't to run the application as the physical machine. It might be a problem with the virtual machine. The best fix is to start a virtual machine with administrator rights, then start the application with the user account. I tried this, but it didn't seem to work.<|endoftext|>From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.

The topic of this article has been removed from the real world, and as such has no connection to the real world Pokémon games.

This article is about the real world Pokémon games and spin-off games. For the virtual world in the Pokémon Trading Card Game franchise, see Pokémon Live!

Pokémon Live! (Japanese: ポケモンLive! Pokémon Super Live! Pokémon Super! Pokémon in the Japanese version of the Virtual Console releases, Pokémon Super Live!Pokémon Super!Pokémon Super and Pokémon SuperLive! Pokémon Super! in the Japanese releases of the Virtual Console remakes, and ポケモンLive! Pokémon SuperLive! Pokémon Super! Pokémon) is a worldwide stage show for Pokémon characters that became a hit in Japan in November of 2006. It had a limited release in North America in March 2007 and Europe in November 2006. Originally a live event that allowed spectators to meet Pokémon in person, the show became a live stage show with guest appearances by Pokémon characters after a successful 2007 tour.

The show now hosts many guest appearances from many Pokémon characters, including Mew and Mewtwo in their Mythical forms, Pichu, Aipom, Cleffa, Igglybuff, Tepig, Electabuzz, Elekid, Magby, Magmar, Electabuzz, and Mime Jr.

It was cancelled in 2014, after which many of the stage shows were removed from the Nintendo eShop (including the American tour in which Tepig and Elekid reappeared as Pokémon characters), the online features were removed, and the Pokémon Center replaced with the Nintendo World Store. In 2014 a tour of Tokyo was held to promote the launch of the Nintendo 3DS, featuring the show.

The shows in the Virtual Console releases, as well as the English Japanese Pokémon Trading Card Game rereleases for the 3DS and Wii U versions of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, use a combination of live and stage performances which were performed on video screens in the theaters.

Plot

The show begins with a montage of each guest's journey to the show, with the Pokémon as they appeared in their own spin-off and spin-off animated series alongside their original appearance in the anime. A special opening is conducted with a song by Gaspare Aran, and the show concludes with the credits.

The English versions of the Virtual Console releases replaced the intro sequence of Pokémon Live! with a brief scene based on the end of the live show, complete with the crowd cheering on the performers and chanting "Ohhhh!". This is followed by the Pokémon characters returning to the Pokémon Center as the opening is conducted with another musical song.

The upcoming Syfy series, Paranormal State, may be the first series to be released while we are still in the middle of a major zombie plague, but that hasn't stopped them from trying to make zombies seem terrifying. This week's episode, "The Curse of the Darkman," featured a "zombie," made out of clay, who was used to scare and scare the audience. While the audience enjoyed this performance, a lot of viewers found the episode itself unsettling, although for the right reasons: the creepy character was actually an act of human performance.

Although the show will air when the zombie plague is over, the cast wasn't the only scary thing the show did in its second episode, which will air on Thursday, September 30, and we decided for our viewing pleasure to take a look at the cast and make them feel the stress of the apocalypse.

I'm not going to lie: one of my favorite segments was the "fear" part of the show. What I mean is, they're all playing people. Everyone is scared, but we are all scared with what we know of human nature. Everyone has a moment where they have a panic attack in front of their friends. It's just the way we are…that's it at least.

That's the point we are trying to be at on our show. We are not attempting to play up any of the fear of the actual zombies we are talking about. We're hoping to actually make people question their own reaction and make them question if they're the kind of people who would willingly come into contact with a creepy clay zombie.

So what do you think of our series? Would you like more scary episodes, or are horror shows the new sitcoms?

(via The Playlist)<|endoftext|>A long-anticipated report from researchers at MIT has found that solar energy can power a light-polluting car, but in a way that's both sustainable and efficient.

Solar power is already becoming more widely used, with several studies finding that the technology is competitive with fossil fuels and could help combat climate change. But most of the existing solar panels are bulky and inefficient, due to solar cells' ability to absorb only a portion of the Sun's energy, which makes them unable to generate enough electricity to power anything besides tiny, portable electronics.

To address these limitations, researchers at MIT and the Argonne National Laboratory looked to a way to turn sunlight directly into electricity in a way that's both more compact and environmentally friendly—and potentially more efficient.

The new findings, published this week by the journal Energy & Environmental Science, are based on using thin, transparent photovoltaics, as opposed to conventional silicon solar cells, to convert the sunlight into electricity that can be stored in a battery. The researchers' prototype batteries can produce up to 1.6 kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is sufficient to power a small LED light bulb over the course of a year—and an electric car. In future designs, the team would like to be able to increase the capacity of the battery to store larger amounts of energy.<|endoftext|>A number of new details are emerging in regards to the FBI's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, following FBI Director James B. Comey's announcement yesterday. The latest update concerns an informant who claims FBI and Justice Department officials have no intention of arresting Clinton over the email issue.

Via PJ Media:

One FBI informant with intimate knowledge of the Clinton investigation tells The Daily Caller about the lack of interest in arresting her. "What's going on is the Justice Department knows they are not going to charge her, so there's not one person in the government who's willing to go to bat for that young lady. They wouldn't do it because it's like telling the fox to guard the hen house. And the FBI is obviously being very careful how it does exactly it—they're not in a hurry. It would have to be a grand jury indictment."

The informant, whose name is not being mentioned by name, reportedly described a "sophisticated" scheme by Clinton and her aides, and the FBI investigators were given documents and evidence by an intermediary with the Clinton Foundation.

He added that if the FBI agents had gone after Clinton, the Clinton network would have retaliated against them. "There's zero chance of this woman walking down that street and walking right behind her if she knows what's good for her, which is the people that know her very well."

======================================== SAMPLE 15 ========================================
In a study of women whose diets contained both high levels of meat and low levels of milk, researchers have discovered that women with low levels of fat in their diets also have lower cholesterol levels. This finding may help explain the rise in cardiovascular disease rates across the developed world that has been seen in the last century and a half.

The study was conducted by researchers headed by Dr Helen Anderson from the School of Nutrition Science & Policy, Imperial College London and Dr Joanna Rowsell from the Department of Public Health at Edinburgh University. The research published this week in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, is the first to investigate the association between diet and cholesterol levels in women aged 70 and over.

The researchers found that women who consumed a high level of whole-fat dairy products and low levels of cholesterol in their diet had higher levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) than women who consumed a low ratio of meat and milk products to dairy. The study found that women who consumed high levels of fat in their diets also had lower levels of cholesterol than women who consumed low levels of fat.

"The results suggest the need for a re-evaluation of cholesterol-lowering dietary strategies for older women," said lead author Dr Helen Anderson. "While a range of diet changes and medications such as statins have proven to be successful, the results of this study suggest that dietary strategies aimed at increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruit and low-fat dairy products may be more effective for preventing cardiovascular disease."

Researchers suggest that the findings help explain the fact that incidence of cardiovascular disease has increased in men and women over the past 20 years while it has declined in people aged 70 and over in western countries such as the UK.

Dr Anderson added : "While previous studies have indicated that a dietary pattern high in fat and cholesterol consumption and low in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products is at best ineffective and may even be bad for the heart, this study indicates that a dietary pattern high in fat and low in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products should receive the attention that it deserves. This could translate to an enormous range of cardiovascular risk prevention strategies to be used to increase heart health in older people."

To investigate the link between a diet high in fat and low in vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products and the risk of coronary heart disease, the researchers followed over a 20-year period 15,876 women aged 70 and over aged between 45-80 years who were enrolled in the Women's Health Study. There were 739 of these women diagnosed with a coronary event and 746 for whom a cause of death could be ascertained and had completed all the necessary questionnaires. During the 20-year follow-up period, the women completed an average of 8.7 questionnaires.

Researchers used data from a previous study of a group of women aged 70-71 years in which the researchers analysed data from five questionnaires. This study, which was performed by researchers from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland and a group at the University of Colorado for Medical Sciences led to the development of an improved questionnaire and questionnaire design and data collection method that allowed the researchers to analyse data from over 1 million women aged 70-82 and women aged over 85.

The diet component the researchers looked at in this study measured by the questionnaire included intake of whole-fat dairy, vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products. The questionnaire also included questions on smoking status.

The researchers found that in the women with coronary heart disease, the consumption of fat and vegetables was directly linked to higher total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol. In contrast, in the women with an LDL cholesterol of less than four, the fat and saturated fat in the diet were inversely related to LDL cholesterol concentrations; but in the women with LDL cholesterol of four or more, diet had no effect.

The average dietary cholesterol intake in this group was 2.3mg per day. In a previous study of 14,800 men with coronary heart disease, researchers found that a diet high in fat and cholesterol consumed by this group was linked to higher levels of LDL cholesterol. In this study, the researchers found that the higher consumption of whole-fat dairy in this group was linked to lower LDL cholesterol, whereas the higher consumption of vegetables, fruits and low-fat milk in this group was linked to higher levels of LDL cholesterol. However, there was no specific link to the intake of cholesterol in general.

The data show that an increase in whole-fat dairy consumption is associated with lower LDL levels. A further reason for this is that a reduction in saturated fat intake has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect; hence increased whole-fat dairy intake helps to protect cardiovascular health by reducing LDL cholesterol levels.

A new poll suggests Donald Trump has a clear lead over his Republican rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.

And while the billionaire has struggled this election cycle to gain traction among the general electorate, the Fox News poll provides a snapshot into the support his campaign enjoys in a handful of key battleground states — a key source of power if he hopes to ultimately win the nomination.

"Trump's campaign is winning the attention of swing voters and helping to expand his support," pollster Daron Shaw said in a statement. "The big story here is that he's doing this in a way that is winning over voters from both parties."

While the poll suggests Trump may have some way to go to catch up with the current Republican front-runner, he has emerged a clear front-runner among many GOP voters, and is well ahead of his likely rival — John Kasich — who finished a distant fifth, with 17 percent.

The poll comes amid an intense and prolonged fight for second place in the delegate count leading up to next week's crucial Republican primary. Trump is well ahead of the rest of the crowded Republican race, including Kasich, who has recently struggled as he's attempted to draw the support of more establishment Republicans in his home state of Ohio.

Trump has surged in recent weeks, taking advantage of a series of positive policy announcements, and also has improved his favorability ratings, making his support among Republican primary voters significantly harder to erase.

The Fox News poll was conducted June 20-24, surveying 3,017 registered Republican voters nationwide and 1,032 likely primary voters. The poll results have a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points and the registered Republican electorate was 36.9 percent Democrats, 32.2 percent independents, 15.4 percent Republicans, 7.9 percent Democrats and 4.3 percent Republicans.<|endoftext|>HARRISBURG, Pa (KDKA) — The FBI is offering a reward of up to $15,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the November abduction of three children and attempted murder of a fourth person.

The three children between the ages of 2 and 9 years old were last seen leaving their home between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. in the 1500 block of Woodview Drive, in Allentown, at approximately 11 p.m. on Nov. 13.

One of the children — 12-year-old Abigail Kopf — managed to call a family friend before running out the back door to find her sister with a gunshot wound to the head.

"We would just like to know where these three children are. They are missing, and we're concerned," said Jill Kopf, Abigail's great-aunt.

She says Abigail was abducted as she returned home from visiting her grandparents.

"I think the most important thing that is most important in this has to do with what this accomplishes. We now have an actual abduction," Kopf said.

While police say Kopf called police after getting hit with the gunshot wound, she herself has given them a new lead.

"What she tells us … is that she tried to get back into her car, but it wouldn't start with the key. That she drove back here, that the house, the door was unlocked, but she thought one of the kids should be able to get in. She left her phone on the back step, and the last text that she sent was asking for help, as she saw that her brother was on his way," said Jill Kopf.

The FBI, with assistance from PennDOT, have been investigating what might have happened.

Calls For Boycott Of Israel, Iran

On July 25, 2013, Iran released three American prisoners, including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, as the U.S. criticized Tehran's international isolation. This same day there was a call by the Palestinian people to Boycott Israeli products. The American Academy Of Pediatrics' new position paper on the topic asserts an urgent link between Israeli-Palestinian violence and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign (BDS). The American Academy of Pediatrics is the nation's most prominent pediatrician's professional organization, with over 16,000 certified pediatricians, and serves as a resource for physicians in America's public schools.

On July 25, 2013, Israel released three American prisoners, including Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian, as the U.S. criticized Tehran's international isolation. This same day there was a call by the Palestinian people to Boycott Israeli products.

The American Academy of Pediatrics' new position paper on the topic asserts an urgent link between Israeli-Palestinian violence and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign (BDS). The American Academy of Pediatrics is the nation's most prominent pediatrician's professional organization, with over 16,000 certified pediatricians, and serves as a resource for physicians in America's public schools. We are deeply concerned about the Israeli-Palestinian violence that is being fueled by BDS. These are not simple "two-sided" conflicts; the conflict is about who can do what to the other. Many in Palestinian communities are losing hope that peace will come to their communities; they no longer believe the Israeli government will ever negotiate a just solution.

What is BDS?

BDS stands for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions against Israel. BDS is based on the nonviolence principle of the Palestinian civil and political struggle for freedom and equality. These aims are not contradictory; they are complementary. It is also known as the "two states for two peoples" solution, because Palestinians, with international support and with the full support of the global boycott, divestment and sanction movement, should have the right to live together in a free and democratic state with full equality. The goal of the BDS movement is to achieve just outcomes for Palestinians through nonviolent means – without recourse to armed struggle.

BDS is not anti-Semitic. To call BDS anti-Semitic is an insult to both the Jews and the Jewish people.

What is the impact of BDS on the health of Palestinians?

The movement has brought about some tangible benefits for the Palestinian community. It has made international news and generated an important dialogue among international, national and grassroots supporters and opponents of Israeli policies.

In one area, Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory on land the Palestinians consider their own threatens them with a loss of control over resources and essential services such as electricity, water and education. But there have also been concrete victories, including, for example:

The recent election of the first Palestinian President ever.

A significant drop in violence and arrests in East Jerusalem.

Protests against high prices in the West Bank and the removal of subsidies on electricity and water, and on water for Gaza, making access to clean drinking-water and sanitation more affordable to families.

An Israeli law prohibiting businesses providing goods or services in support of non-official Israeli groups affiliated with the Palestinian Authority.

A new Palestinian civil society initiative to advance human development, including women's empowerment, freedom of movement and human rights.

The ability of Palestinian children to enter high schools free of discrimination based on their religion, nationality or ethnicity.

The movement has also brought the Israeli government's policies into more question, as they've demonstrated what appears to be an increasingly anti-democratic approach to the Palestinians. And as evidenced by recent developments in the Israeli government's handling of the prisoners, an increasing number of Palestinians and Jewish Israelis are willing to call for boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against the state of Israel.

What is the impact of the economic, political, social and educational boycotts?

These nonviolent campaigns have already shifted the conversation. At the very least, they demonstrate a willingness to take a different stance that is more supportive of Palestinian rights. As the Israeli government has shown that its policies are unacceptable to a growing number in the Palestinian community, and the international community continues to move in this direction, it's not unreasonable that more people around the world would be willing to call for the same.

The question of economic boycotts and economic sanctions (BDS) is one of the most difficult. However, the most recent U.S. Senate resolution that recognizes BDS as a foreign policy tool should provide a useful benchmark for understanding what is possible. To avoid being labeled as anti-Semitic, it is important to make clear that all means of non-violent resistance are welcome and should be supported.

One way to understand the difference between BDS and economic pressure is to consider a hypothetical: Suppose Israel agreed to immediately release all the

If there's one thing we can say about the first season of ABC's new reality series, The Bachelor, it's this: it will be entertaining.

In the first episode alone, several contestants got a little too much into each other's personal lives and had to kiss goodbye once the cameras came on.

But while it was all a little bit…weird, this season is just plain great.

The first few episodes have shown that contestants are very comfortable in their own skin, getting to know each other on a very human level without any of this voyeurism or weirdness.

Not only have the first few episodes shown that men don't always need more women for a hot date, but that not all women want to be the center of attention.

The second season will give us more insight into each season of the show, and we look forward to the revelations and the relationships that will come from the first 11 episodes.

It was the second week of the NFL Scouting Combine -- that means it's the time at which some top prospects from all corners of the country go through workouts to get in the best physical condition they can as they prepare for the NFL Draft. But, unfortunately, there was very little substance to talk about in the field -- some players did great, while others struggled to make plays. And even though the Combine is often used as a way for some prospects to get a feel for how their stock is going, there's a reason a lot of players don't end up being drafted when they come out of the Combine.

With the exception of a few notable workouts, let's look at four notable events from this week, from the top players in an important position group to some of the draft prospects who stood out the most on the field:

Offensive tackle

Travis Frederick, Texas A&M: If there's one position group where the Combine is really hard to predict, it's offensive line. So when there is an event like the combine for it, you have to use it as a way to get a feel for where prospects will be picked, but you have to be careful not to overreact to it. In that sense, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones is very smart to have selected left tackle Tyron Smith with the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, and to sign Frederick and Andrew Jackson in free agency. Frederick was the best player on the most well-publicized event this week, the bench press (or the "losing press" as it's so lovingly called), which was conducted in front of the entire public -- in other words, it didn't matter that the rest of the Combine was closed (although I would have liked to have seen a separate event held for that). Frederick finished with 7 reps of 225 pounds on his bench, and didn't look out of place when he was asked to do something similar in front of some media. There was a lot of chatter that he could go higher in the draft if, for example, he showed that he's just over the bench-press hurdle, but he didn't do anything to alter that perception.

The draft for offensive linemen has a lot of holes, not the least of which is the current depth chart between Joe Thomas and Lane Johnson at left tackle. It took Thomas two workouts -- one in Indianapolis one in Mobile, Alabama -- to impress, but once Smith was off the board, there really wasn't anything to make him seem like a sure thing. Thomas was one of the last of the big guys to perform, and his performance may have been the most impressive -- for whatever that's worth. He wasn't all that impressive in his short workout on Thursday, but he was all right, though he wasn't much taller that Johnson. Thomas should stick with the Browns at one spot, but he may not get there for some time.

Joey Bosa's performance on the bench press, while not a great one given his size, was still fairly impressive in his short workout, which came on Thursday. He finished with 6 reps and 225 pounds on his bench, and he did a great job of showing off his athleticism on that one -- it was really difficult trying to get him back in to his feet and to keep him upright. It was a good start for what should easily be considered the top offensive line prospect in the draft, but it's clear there's a

The state Senate is trying to block implementation of a new state law that would ban discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people, arguing it infringes on the separation of church and state.

But Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, R-Chandler, says it's a matter of protecting religious freedom in a land of secularism.

"There's no place for religion in government, and when we start putting religion in government, then we're going to be a different place," said Steinberg, noting the bill is a response to a recent Supreme Court decision striking down part of the state's 2003 gay rights ordinance that had allowed cities and townships to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Senate Bill 1182 would make it illegal to discriminate in business, employment, housing and public accommodations against gay, lesbian or transgender people, as well lesbians and transgender people.

Steinberg's bill now goes to the House, but the Senate is expected to vote on the measure tonight.

Rep. Steve Hickey, R-Phoenix, said he has not fully considered the bill, but he suspects Steinberg is trying to prevent implementation of the law.

"I'm a firm believer that every individual should be protected, but not at the expense of the separation of church and state, in my opinion," Hickey said, adding his "religious freedom and privacy rights will have been infringed upon" under the bill.

Steinberg said he doesn't plan to stop the bill when it comes to the House floor unless there are problems there.

"I'm not going to stop an effort to protect our religious liberties, whether we're in the Senate or the House," Steinberg said.

Steinberg also said the bill will allow the state Supreme Court to interpret it in a way that does not conflict with the high court's 2003 decision striking down parts of the city-specific ordinance.

Hickey also said he wants the bill amended because he doesn't want the state Supreme Court to be involved in the interpretation part.

Steinberg said that if the court decides to clarify the law's constitutionality, then it would be up to the House to decide whether to take up the issue again.

The bill "protects everybody; gay, straight, transgender or straight," Steinberg said. "They're not protected and they will be protected here."<|endoftext|>I was on vacation when this happened. I was on vacation, and on my Facebook feed I saw someone posting about the fact a woman who had been working in a bakery in San Diego had been caught shoplifting. I thought it couldn't get anymore fucked up, but in the same way I was in the airport when I saw a guy flying to Hawaii, I wanted to feel like my life was just one giant fucking lie. And so here I am. I'm writing a story that I feel like I have to let you do the reading. I'm writing this because I feel like it's my duty to inform the world on this horrific thing that happened to me, and in the hope that it might make the situation a little less fucking horrible for other people. The following is completely fictional, and any resemblance to characters or events in real life is coincidental. This happened to Sarah, myself and about four hundred other people. The story starts at 9:30am, and we're all still in our own cabins at 7:00am. It's still fucking hot, but no way does a fucking bikini model deserve to be in the middle of the ocean, even for a couple days. Sarah is here and she's wearing a bikini. It's a light orange coloured one, and the top of it just says 'CATEGORE.' The top barely covers her neck, and only covers enough. It looks like a good three-quarter length top, that barely covers any of her body at all. All the holes in her bottom are completely exposed. We're sitting in a cabin about twenty kilometres off the coast of Costa Rica. There's no wind, just the steady pounding of our own hearts in our ears, and a little bit of salt water dripping on our faces. We were all sitting outside eating sandwiches. It's pretty quiet, only the birds chirping a little bit in the trees. We're all dressed up in our swimsuits, except Sarah is in some skimpy little string bikini. She sits on the chair beside me and stretches out, her hips pressing against mine. She closes her eyes and reaches up with her forefingers and fingers to move the bikini around her boobs a bit. It makes her nipples stick out more, but the bikini top isn't so bad. I take off my bikini top. I can't really feel my tits, they're still pretty firm but the bottom of my top is really tight, making it look as though my chest might burst through. I have a feeling that my nipples are a bit big as well. I pull the bikini up between my legs

"This is the one part of my business that is guaranteed to get people's attention and give them reasons to come inside." -Tucker Max

For over thirty years, Tucker Max has been one of the country's most highly known, widely quoted, and most controversial speakers, who has never backed down from any controversial claim, no matter how many times people have called him a troll or an asshole, an insensitive asshole or a man who's entire "identity" is founded on a gross over-generalization.

His most recent book, I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell, caused a stir when it was released on October 25, 2012. It's a book that attempts to prove that women are "sluts" and that any attempts to engage in consensual activity are merely for a man's sexual gratification.


Now it appears that Max has turned his attention to an even more contentious subject with his recent appearance at the University of Kansas last Thursday.

According to a report in The Daily Caller, on the same evening that Tucker Max was "discussing the 'sluttification' of women," a "large group" of men from the campus's Men's Rights Activists (or "MRA" for short) group "hacked into the Facebook page" of professor Laurie Penny and "tweeted that they were 'bitter' over what they perceived as a lack of feminism on campus."


"They then posted various comments disparaging those women who were seen as feminists, among them that the 'feminist movement is a farce, a scam, a money making scheme,' and that 'women's equality starts with the right to choose who one f*cking wants to have sex with...you are sluts if you don't."

It did not take long for students of the University of Kansas to come to conclusions about the men.

According to a report in the Kansas City Star, "Several students told the newspaper that, while the idea of men's rights activists was not new to them, this was the first time they were aware of an attack on a feminist on campus."


"The university is standing down and not addressing the issue." -University of Kansas

"These are men who don't even have a right to feel safe on a campus." -Sandra Stotsky

"The issue is these are not normal people we're dealing with and it puts our university in a very dangerous situation. I feel violated that they would try to ruin my education." —Sandra Stotsky

"This incident just reflects how bigoted and patriarchal this society really is and the people who think they're above the law and not worthy of being treated the way we treat women are disgusting," said another KU student, Ashley Smith.

Others disagreed, and pointed out that while the professor in question was indeed criticized by her fans for having the temerity to bring up her belief in "equality among the sexes," it was merely a discussion of the concept of feminism, rather than a statement against equality.

"This incident happens to be a professor who has written and spoken widely on feminism, and she's using it and talking about it and not just saying, 'That's not what feminism means,'" said the student, who asked not to be named, as she and the professor are both on the university's public relations team. "It's like her being a woman is not enough to take these men down."<|endoftext|>This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

Her article is titled "Obama's Border Plan Doesn't Address the Border Crisis." In it, she writes, quote, "In reality, it's the president's border plan that could provide real security to Mexico. Instead, it's his plan to ignore Mexico and its crisis."

MARCY WHEELER: It is an insult all around to the entire Mexican nation, not just to the families who are struggling but to the Mexican people as a whole. It really speaks to an overall attitude that we have here at CNN, there's a little bit of arrogance about how we view the world. There's arrogance to not just see Mexico as an extension of the United States, it almost sounds like we feel the United States is our brother with whom we have a special place in our family, and we don't see Mexico in that same way anymore.

But is it still relevant? (Spoiler alert: It probably is.) For all the hand-wringing over the party's political "death spiral"—and if you believe the GOP's latest autopsy—it looks like things may get slightly better after all. A number of pundits have taken to calling 2018 and 2020 "the Republican Revolution," a reference to the GOP's electoral success in 1986 of all years (when they won the Senate and House, and ousted GOP presidents, by large margins).

This notion that the Party can and will once again do everything it used to do is, of course, nonsense. The Trump presidency isn't going to lead to a "revolution." There won't be a GOP Senate majority either. Republicans are still very likely to lose the House in 2018, and the Republican president will be heading off to a sixth term in 2020. But Miller is right to claim that the Republican Party is in good shape, or at least in better shape than the Democrats.

So where is it good? The GOP has managed to maintain its electoral dominance in the states (i.e., all those states that voted for Bill Clinton in the mid-to late nineties). And in the House, the numbers suggest that the GOP is headed in the same direction, though its path is anything but clear. As the following graphs show, the House is the most conservative in the country relative to the median voter (the blue horizontal line represents the Republican median voter in each state), but it is not the most conservative in relation to the general electorate, which will be the Democratic Party's focus this election season.


It is noteworthy that in both the House and Senate, the Democratic Party is doing very well with the very young voters, who could prove critical in the next two presidential elections against Trump. It is worth noting, too, how different the two graphs look, particularly when it comes to the House.

In the previous decade, Republicans had to deal with a Democratic Party that was more than able to field a candidate in every state, whether it were Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. This year, that task might be easier for Democrats. But that does not mean the Republican Party will benefit from this. The "Republican Revolution" is like Ronald Reagan's promise of tax cuts—it is a slogan that helps motivate voters to go to the polls, but is almost impossible to deliver in the end.

In any case, there is a big difference between a slogan and an electoral strategy. The GOP has had a lot of success at both, in the electoral sense. But the party continues to lose seats in state houses, congressional districts, and states that once seemed immune to its brand of political extremism. It makes little sense to cling to that slogan unless you're willing to change with the times—to embrace policies that reflect the preferences of the Democratic base, and to shift your focus to an electoral strategy that helps you win at the presidential level.

That is, after all, what it was all about in 1986—and now even Dennis Miller is admitting that.<|endoftext|>HBO Documentary Films The Night Of

The man was taken into custody during a "security check" in the area surrounding the Olympic torch relay on the streets of Berlin, the police official's report on the incident said.

"A check was made to make sure he did in fact meet the passport requirements," the police said in a statement

The person was "detained in custody," "then handed over to security officials who further discussed the conditions for his release."

The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Authorities said in December that a Canadian citizen with dual Canadian-American citizenship could not be excluded from Rio De Janeiro due to a previous felony conviction.

That person, who was in line to lead the torch relay, passed all the security checks. He was not detained.

There can be no entry to the Games for U.S. citizens or dual citizens of the U.S., Canada or other countries "due to their criminal convictions," the IOC said in the statement.

The U.S. Department of State released a statement Friday evening saying that the U.S. Consulate General in Berlin would continue to work with Brazilian authorities to "provide information on any American citizen who may be in need of travel documents," according to NBC affiliate KCBS.

The statement said the U.S. would continue "to monitor reports of foreign nationals barred from entering the country."<|endoftext|>The US is ready to provide the Russian Federation with "lethal arms" to "protect its security interests and vital infrastructure" in Ukraine, Deputy Secretary of State William Burns told CNN. And he confirmed that the US may also offer the Ukrainian government money to pay for this aid.

However, he also said that this will only happen if Russia actually withdraws from eastern Ukraine. In the meantime, Washington is preparing to send troops to the east of the country to protect the military facilities "we have deployed there, there are military facilities that we now control there," he said.

Burns' statement came only hours after the Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced an initial plan to train Ukrainian security forces and arm them with Russian weapons. The training will start in August and will last "up to three months." This will include helping Ukrainian forces fight off the terrorists, but will also involve helping with the anti-bombing of Ukraine.

This plan is more aggressive than the one announced by President Obama just hours earlier. The US "will not provide lethal weaponry to Ukraine," Obama said.

According to the Obama plan, the US will also step up efforts to assist the Ukrainian military in training and equipping the border guard unit at the Russian-Ukrainian border. Hagel explained that the US will not accept the new Russian troop build-up on the Ukraine border.

This is not the first time that the US has offered weapons to Ukraine. In March, the US was ready to send "defensive weaponry" to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the wake of the Euromaidan protests. However, the Pentagon never gave Ukraine the weapons it promised, instead opting to keep it in reserve for a possible future crisis.<|endoftext|>I'm a
======================================== SAMPLE 23 ========================================
A couple of months ago I began building and designing an Arduino/Genuino clone based on the AVR Micro. This project was mainly aimed at keeping costs down in order to build and sell the thing for as little as possible. I have been working on this project for over two years and over the course of that time I've learned things as a designer that I would never have considered. This is why I decided to share some of them! Please note that I'm not a programmer by trade and this has not been coded from scratch. I'm just a guy with a keen interest in electronics and microcontrollers.

A lot of things I learned over the past two years are just so simple that you won't even need the fancy words here.

Make a schematic for your project first.

There are many different ways to draw schematics: Schematic View, Sketchup, etc…. I will describe in this tutorial which I find the easiest to use to build a project.

You see two or three components in the illustration above. These parts are called 'subcircuits'. The circuit shown above is a four transistors 3.3V/250mA amplifier. This is a 'pure' amplifier and doesn't have any additional effects of any kind. It just runs a circuit. The circuit shows you how to connect the transistors for a 'pure' amplifier.

With a schematic in hand you only need to connect one board in order to build your circuit. There are only 4 boards per circuit. This means you can work on two boards, three boards, or even four boards for a bigger, more complex amplifier. If you decide to connect multiple circuits together you could, for example, have your amplifier working in parallel with two transistors working in series for a 'dual-stage amplifier'. By the way, I was never good with the parallel design because I had a habit of using the wrong polarity on both transistors. That's why it looks like two transistors in parallel! This is a little bit more work for the designer but you can just fix it in your prototype before you print it out. Just make sure you use the correct polarity or you will see your amp in a dark, nasty glow.

If you want to add effects, do so before the design is finished. This will help you to easily visualize the circuit when you are designing it and will also save you a lot of time.

You will also want to connect the voltage regulators which are a common requirement. But don't connect them until you are sure that they are wired properly. Most Arduino/Genuino clones have the regulators with the power and ground wires facing towards the inside of the board. They should be plugged into your power supply so they don't leak.

To connect the voltage regulation board you have to unsolder the wires for the red wire on the left hand side of both of the two voltage regulators on the left side of the board. If you accidentally remove these wires you are not going to be able to connect them again. Take a pair of pliers and pinch the wires to break the contact between the regulators. You will also have to remove or loosen the power/ground pin on the right hand side as this is normally connected to the breadboard. This is to make the connection easier (or less painful if it is a tight connection). To make this connection use whatever pliers you have. In my case I got a pair of pliers that I used to break the wire in the right hand side regulator. Make sure you are pliers free.

Once you have the connections made the rest of the circuit should be pretty much self explanatory. Please keep in mind that these are 'specs' of the circuit pictured above and there can certainly be more or less depending for example on your board and how to build the amplifier. There are also slight differences between the AVR Micro and the other Arduino clones. The AVR Micro has more pins. One of the reasons I like it is for smaller power loads. I can fit this transistor inside a breadboard. I would also recommend adding some extra LEDs. This is not a particularly exciting build but when you look at the schematic you will see that the LEDs are connected directly to the 3v and GND pins on the 3.3V regulator board. This will ensure a much better voltage regulation as well as light the LED's.

In the picture below you can see the LED's that will be connected to the Arduino/Mouser/Microchip's 3v3 and GND pins on the 3.3V regulator board.

Now that the design is finished we can start working on adding the components to the circuit.

Using the breadboard

Here is the circuit that looks good on the breadboard. You can see that I removed the breadboard's connector for the voltage regulator so that I can work without any breadboard wires. This circuit is a bit better than the one shown

Hansa, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, is reportedly set to announce today that it will begin trading Bitcoin futures, a move that could give institutional investors access to Bitcoin's soaring price.

Since its inception in mid-2014, Bitcoin's market cap has skyrocketed from roughly $1 million to almost $10 billion. But with Bitcoin's price currently around $16,000, it's hard for institutional investors to get exposure to such an early stage asset. The Bitcoin futures market, however, should give institutional investors easier access to the cryptocurrency because they'll be able to purchase "bets" — or shares — on the cryptocurrency's price in the event that it surpasses certain price thresholds.

The announcement comes a year after it was first revealed that the exchange would launch a Bitcoin futures market, and the news could give the market momentum as 2017 comes to an end. In a note on Wednesday, Reuters outlined this year's highlights for Bitcoin, saying:

A series of new exchanges that provide investors new entry points into the Bitcoin market have opened their doors to volume traders, traders said as they bet for gains and losses on the virtual currency through futures contracts from CME Group and CBOE Global Markets on the CME's bitcoin Futures exchange, and from Cboe Global Markets on CBOE's bitcoin futures exchange.

Futures, on the other hand, are traded between entities on a spot basis and don't involve any actual cash or gold in between. Investors are simply betting on changes in the price of Bitcoin in the future, with buyers buying futures on the expectation that Bitcoin will go up in price and sellers selling futures on the expectation that it will go down. Both sides of the trade are known as "betting."

Despite the fact that most investors do not actually know the price of Bitcoin — even after being introduced through Bitcoin Cash — the price of futures is a way for financial markets to "see" what Bitcoin is really worth. For instance, in 2016 Bitcoin's price rose significantly above traditional currencies, leading to a large spike in futures prices.

Hansa, after launching a futures market for Bitcoin in March 2016, said that it expects to list Bitcoin futures on April 30.<|endoftext|>The European Union is threatening to impose new trade sanctions against Russia unless Moscow changes its approach to Ukraine. But, according to the Russian economy minister, economic measures would hurt the average Russian.

"Sanctions are not going to hurt our companies," Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev said in an interview with the Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy. "A drop in the ruble is not going to hurt our companies." He said these measures would hit Russians in general more than European companies.

"The most important things would be to stop financing this aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, and make these problems go away," he said, while defending the measures the West has taken since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last year.

Ulyukayev's comments are significant given the Russian economy minister has a reputation—among the highest in the government—for speaking bluntly. The European Union has already imposed numerous measures since 2014, including visa bans on some Russian officials, travel bans, asset freezes and higher interest rates.

In addition, the European Union's executive body last year adopted the first ever sanctions against Russia, imposing a visa ban and asset freezes on a dozen top Russian officials and companies.<|endoftext|>The following is a transcript of President Donald Trump's inaugural address.

My fellow Americans, this is the moment when the future of our nation must be decided. On January 20, 2017, one year from today, our nation will finally get its first president.

I have to say, this is, in a word, exciting. This is a change, a breath of fresh air. A change. To the sound of music from across the ocean. To the sight of these new American citizens coming out and celebrating with us, we'll all be inspired more than ever before, and we will keep on striving towards that brighter day.

To many of you this is more than just about a new administration. With each passing day, our American journey continues on — our values will inspire generations to come, along with the extraordinary American stories that will define this moment.

Today, the greatest nation in the world was built on the principles that embody the very essence of our democracy: the rule of law, the truth, and faith in the people.

And though our journey has been long, and the challenges have been numerous, we have never paused to rest. We know that for our Founders this was a crucial moment like no other when it came to founding a brand of government that could be new and yet strong. And it is so fitting that, just two months before the inauguration of our first President, this very same government was founded upon these very same rights and these very same principles.

As an organization, we can't do that as citizens.

That's why we've taken a stand by donating our time and materials to assist our neighbors.

While we can't speak for the individual, many of the neighbors I work with have been affected by a terrible tragedy that struck their neighbors. They have expressed grief and pain. In response, we have offered to join them in their grief by offering our assistance.

This effort was organized as a joint effort between our two teams. The first "team" consisted of our own security and management teams.

Our security staff has trained with other firms on how to identify signs of a suspicious person, such as looking for items of note that are visible or hard to see. These types of events do not call for a large amount of security staff at the event, because they are typically relatively low tech. For example, there won't be a lot of cameras. Instead, our security personnel will use non-intrusive methods to identify activity.

Our "team" was comprised of an "advanced security professional," who helped in identifying, monitoring and responding to unusual activity that warranted advanced security, or who was on site prior to a major event with us.

We would ask you to keep this information confidential. We would like to remain uninvolved in the matter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Europe and other major powers have "made an offer that the Kremlin can't refuse," U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Sunday, urging Russia to abandon any idea of a military intervention in Ukraine.

"We are not asking the Russians to invade, we are asking the Russians to stand down, to pull back. And we are also calling for a political response from Ukraine that reflects its commitment to democracy and respects the interests of all of the Ukrainian people," Lew told ABC News.

Washington and its European partners have already imposed sanctions on Russian officials and businesses linked to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that is dominated by Russia and has been annexed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in March.

Lew's comments come hours after U.S. officials said the United States and European partners will impose new sanctions on Russian companies, banks and individuals.

There have been recent reports that Moscow is considering sending troops into Crimea, but so far the Russian government has denied the reports.

"We are also asking that the Russian be allowed to use military means only to protect ethnic Russian speakers who were under threat, to defend Russian interests and to avoid the tragedy there that I think really calls up a broader set of issues," Lew said.

He was speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, which will air live from Brussels on Sunday morning (2000 GMT).

He reiterated President Barack Obama's stance that any Russian attempt to annex Ukraine's Crimea region "will be unacceptable to the international community, will not be tolerated by the international community, and will trigger costs and consequences to Russia that will be determined by the international community".

"We believe Russia has until now failed to live up to its responsibilities but we continue to believe this is not an option that is going to be tolerated," Lew said.

He also said Russia's economic ties with Ukraine would have to be reviewed if the peninsula was not annexed.

Lew said his message to Russia had been that it should make a "serious effort" to defuse tensions with its neighboring state.

"They are, of course, going out of their way to create tensions and tensions that are increasing tensions. And in the final analysis Russia's continued attempts to engage in this are going to be unacceptable to the international community," Lew said.

His public words appear to be aimed at President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly denied any involvement in Ukraine's unrest.

Putin has sent his foreign minister to the United States and is expected to meet on the sidelines of the G8 in Northern Ireland on Sunday, where the unrest in Ukraine is likely to top the agenda.<|endoftext|>It's that time of year again: Halloween. It's been a long time coming, but now the first of the season is upon us–and not necessarily a good one. In an effort to bring this year's festivities back to Earth, I thought it's time to take a close look at the past, present and future of horror movies.

As most of the country's residents are surely familiar with, Halloween is traditionally a time when Americans enjoy dressing up, tricking or possibly just being pranked. But for many people, the time of the year has also represented the end of the month Halloween celebrations. And while Halloween has since become a time for family gatherings, and the passing of time, it's likely that no one will ever be able to know how it all began.

Now, in the last two weeks of the season, the team is off until March 28 to get away from the "stadium jungle" of Manhattan and start the summer training camps for next season. After playing every other day, NYCFC have a very difficult week to rest ahead of the 2017 MLS season opener.

On Wednesday, the New York squad got the full treatment at the Brooklyn Institute of Technology's Nippert Stadium as a new season started with a good old friendly in the South Bronx. The game was hosted by the New York Red Bulls on the old 2K Field. We saw a few familiar faces including Frank Lampard, David Villa, and Chris Rolfe, whose father, Tony, is the President of the club, and who has been a supporter of the New York team since it was known as the MetroStars. The atmosphere was very reminiscent of the days when the Brooklyn Ultras helped lead the squad to the MLS Cup Final back in 2008.

The Red Bulls had been looking for a game against the visiting team, as they faced the likes of Chicago, DC United, Toronto FC, Houston, and Seattle during the spring season. After being the only opponent eliminated from the playoffs during the spring season, they were hungry to prove themselves again. They dominated the first half of the match with some great attacking play and possession, which was a departure from their last match in Montreal.

With less than an hour left on the clock in the first half, the Red Bulls took the lead in dramatic fashion after another dangerous chance was created by Mike Grella, however the goalkeeper, Luis Robles, made the stop with a reflex save to keep the score line level. After a half hour, the Red Bulls added a second goal through a great pass from Sacha Kljestan. After some fine passing between Mike Grella and Mike Grella, Kljestan passed it to Bradley Wright-Phillips who put a wonderful strike into the near bottom left corner past goalkeeper Miguel Gallardo. New York had a one goal lead going into the break and did not look like conceding a goal in the second half and were only denied when Sebastien Le Toux, who was brought on as a half-time substitute, played a long throw-in and it resulted in a goal. NYCFC pulled even as an 86th minute goal from Wright-Phillips put the score at 3-3.

It was an excellent week for the New York Red Bulls and despite what could have been a disappointing draw with the New England Revolution, they will look forward to getting a chance to bounce back next week as they wrap up the regular season at Red Bull Arena against FC Dallas.

The best part of these episodes is that it's all completely true. I've been going on about the power of the "sadist" meme lately, and now that people are taking it (a little) seriously, the power of the "sadist" meme is more than apparent.

To anyone who wasn't living under a rock or using one of the myriad of social media platforms I mentioned in my last post, I encourage you to read it. Even the smallest and most basic of our online communications and interactions are influenced by what others post about them.

My friend Matt, who just left his job in Hollywood in search of a better gig, posted a comment on my Instagram post about my love for The Simpsons on Thursday. According to him, this was a huge mistake.

Well, Matt was right.

The fact that he decided to post this comment without actually watching the episode (he probably just skimmed my post) is the main problem here. And if there is anyone who needs extra evidence that this is the internet, it's Matt. He posted this comment before he had even watched the episode.

I would like to apologize to Matt. I apologize to anyone who might have taken his comment the wrong way.

The sadistic little social media meme he took a moment to post was a viral, extremely powerful, and totally true story. People can get fired for making dumb decisions, especially ones as big and life-changing as a move from one job to another. But there is one thing you can't get fired for, and that's saying something dumb online or about someone else's feelings before you get a chance to watch the episode.

I don't have any beef with Matt, I've never met him. I hope he gets the job he seeks. But what he did in posting this is extremely disappointing to me. It is one of the most pathetic things I have ever seen on the internet. People get upset because a joke they don't feel funny is published online. You can be fired for posting offensive content online, but Matt took a step further by making a joke that people found funny because his boss would probably fire him if he tweeted that.

So, I have a question for you, Matt. What's next?

This is your last chance. I want you to tell me if this can be the first step down the path to being a social media sadist. If a small part of your social media posts involve making fun of someone, can you imagine what it would look like if you posted something negative about a coworker?

Just imagine.

Can you imagine the social media shitstorm and media panic if you said something about a woman, and a bunch of your followers jumped on the bandwagon before you even watched one single episode of The Simpsons? I just don't think it would be that hard for The Simpsons writers to make you look like a terrible person on television, or at least they would let you have an excuse to.

I promise, the writers would not give you that excuse for the post you posted just now, right?

Because you did. But not before watching one episode, then the second episode.<|endoftext|>After the big update to Minecraft 1.10 - the ability to drop items from the air - the devs had no idea how to make a proper landing animation.

It was not long, however, before I discovered Roberts had been hard at work on something much different: Star Citizen.

Star Citizen will be a massively multiplayer space game, set in a universe Roberts calls the "Persistent Universe." The game will feature multiple human factions and planetside spaceships. It will also feature first person combat, planetary landings, and a story told in the form of a single-player cinematic.

"This isn't just another MMO."

"As you can see, there are many different methods to create various types of watercolors. In all cases, the two basic steps will be to first apply a pigment to a very dry piece of paper and then coat it with water and a bit of turpentine (make sure you leave the paper for hours at a temp of about 140* while painting). This, of course, is not the only way to do such things; there are a lot of methods and they are varied and not mutually exclusive. As for technique, you can either use your own paint or paint a bit of your choice onto a canvas. If you use a white watercolor, there is plenty of room for experimentation. It is advisable, however, to use a black paint or watercolor in a white-on-black setting, or at least a neutral tone to the colors." (Page 8 of Introduction by E.C. Beck)<|endoftext|>You're in luck. If you had a pre-order for the Xbox One, you should be receiving your console a few weeks ahead of launch. If you haven't gotten your Pre-purchase Kit yet, you may have to wait longer. Microsoft said last week that in some parts of the world, the console isn't shipping as expected, and that some shipments have been delayed.

In an update to their FAQ, Microsoft told us that "We are working with our partners to address the shipping and delivery delays that have occurred," but wouldn't provide more specific details. Here's what they told a Reddit user when the PS4 was delayed:

"We've seen an uptick in shipping and delivery delays and are working hard to get things corrected for as many customers as possible."

It makes sense that a lot of these delays happen when you're trying to get all the components on a device and get them to a shipping destination. We'll keep you posted when more information becomes available.

As a result, a lot of great artists have recorded on microphones. Now, you can get all of those recordings for free–and with some nice extras.

I was delighted to find that the internet is full of free MP3 download sites. You can listen to pretty much any recording. These sites have lots of free music available and the artists are mostly from all over the world. Some are fairly new. Others are well known and have been in existence for ages. I'm sure you can find some that interest you.

When I saw that the world was full of free recordings, it started to dawn on me that I could take part in that. So, today I decided to create a page to share all the free songs that are included in my online library. Here's how:

1. Download the free mp3 files online

2. Download each mp3 file

3. Save them to your computer

4. Copy the file addresses to your email account

5. Email your files to the address you created on the page

6. Follow this page to the end!

If you download mp3 files and don't want to share them, you can easily do that and get them off my server. Also, you can make your own mp3 download service and link from this site to your own download server. I'm just a small indie musician, but with just this site I can share my music with the world. This is the first thing I plan on doing. There are lots of ways you could share this music, so stay tuned.

I know that many of you will be interested in finding out more about these free recordings. That's why we'll also be adding a section to our website later where you can click on any song for more info. Also, I'll create an interview with every recording we get. So, be sure to check in here regularly.

Here's another free album by a great local artist:


And here's a great song by the famous Canadian folk singer, Alanis Morissette.


Here's more free music, all of it from Australia:


And even more free music by other Australian artists!


And as always, if you have any problems with any of the files I linked to above, feel free to leave comments and help out! I'll be checking things from time to time.

It was released on April 10, 2014 for the PSVita via Sony Entertainment Network, and October 23, 2014 for iOS via iosupport. It is a direct sequel to the first game and takes place between its first and second season. The story takes place between the events of Payback and Claptastic Voyage. The player controls various characters in a post-apocalyptic world, attempting to uncover the mystery of Pandora along the way and defeat new threats along the way. The plot for the third season is still being explored, with characters still being playable, and Borderlands is being expanded with various side-missions with new and returning characters. The third trailer for the first season was leaked for the PS Vita on May 13th, 2013, but was cancelled before it was released in Japan. The second season was then released in Japan on September 18th, 2014, and in North America and Europe on October 14th, 2014. The third season is yet to be revealed, with a release due later in 2018.

I started playing with the Arduino a month ago and in the process learned that writing software can be very enjoyable. This is not the case for the average person because for them programming is one of the difficult things to do in life but for me it was very exciting, in fact it made me a lot of money and inspired me to design some more projects that can make your Arduino more useful. I will try to give you some hints to make the process easier and less time consuming

Software architecture

When you start building something complex the software architecture comes very early on. This is one of the key factors in the performance and quality of your work. If you have a good understanding of the architecture you can use it to make the whole system simple by separating the logic in small, simple units. In the following I will explain more about the architecture of the Arduino and how to make your code simpler.

The most important thing in this architecture is the digital I/O pins. If your project involves reading from these pins you need to understand that each I/O pin is responsible for delivering a single digit of the input from the analog inputs. So if you are using only 1 analog pin for example, you must understand that each pin's task is to deliver a 1 or a 0.

The analog input pins are labelled in the header pins file but they can be identified by the following name:

P1A1, P1A2, P1A3

Each pin has two states: read/write and low/high. In these two states the pins take a voltage range between 0 and 5v and convert it to a range of 1 or 2 on the digital I/O pins:

To convert a 1 to 0 you use the following formula which works for almost all types of digital pins:

const int analog_max = 5;

Each of these pins can provide a continuous range of 2v to 10v. Therefore you can use the following constants for reading/writing these inputs :

const int analog_min = 0;

const int input_low_range = 0;

const int input_high_range = 5;

In the digital I/O blocks it is important to understand the pin names and pin states as follows:

Pin Name Definition read/write Pin Input is LOW Pin low Input is HIGH pin high Input is LOW low Input is HIGH

The I2C pins can be recognized by the following name:

I2C address 0 = SDA SCL pin address 1 = DIR SCL pin address 2 = DS SDA pin address 3 = DSR SCL pin address 4 = SCK SCL pin address 5 = SMCL SCL pin address 6 = RESET digital SCL

After reading these pins it is essential to convert them to digital. You can do that through the following code snippets.

int read_low(analog_pin)

{

int value = analog_max;

if (value < zero)

return value;

} int write_low(analog_pin, value)

{

int value = analog_min;

if (value > zero)

value = value - 1;

}

To use these variables you need to declare them first in the arduino sketch to which they are needed. The following example does it :

#include <SPI.h>


/*

* analog input pins

*

* SPI usage

*

* The digital I/O pins can be used for both reading and writing. Use the

* pins numbers to identify them. If using multiple pins, you must declare them

* first in the arduino sketch to which they are needed. */

#define analogPin 1


void setup() {

// initialize the analog pins

pinMode(analogPin, OUTPUT); // switch on (0) digital pin

Serial.begin(9600); // start the printer at 9600 baud

}


void loop() {

"The question was, 'Is Hillary going to win the popular vote?' And the answer was yes, she was. We all knew that. Now we're going to find out how accurate it really is. That's probably, like, a pretty accurate thing that they did." – Alex Jones

For quite some time, the establishment media has been projecting a strong Clinton victory in the upcoming 2016 presidential election. Most of the news reporting about the upcoming election has been based on polls that suggest Clinton will easily win the election, while disregarding the huge polling errors that are often attributed to pollsters.


Although most mainstream media polls are completely unreliable, as of early June the mainstream media had been projecting a Clinton victory into the very last day, a Clinton victory that is now all but guaranteed.

The reason that most mainstream news organizations have failed to even acknowledge the vast polling errors is partially due to Hillary Clinton's huge poll lead. When a candidate is ahead by double digits for so long (as was the case with Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire) and has high name recognition, they can effectively manipulate media reports.

In a recent article from Zero Hedge, Alex Jones explained this phenomenon in detail. According to Jones, "The question was, 'Is Hillary going to win the popular vote?' And the answer was yes, she was. We all knew that. Now we're going to find out how accurate it really is. That's probably, like, a pretty accurate thing that they did."

While the exact details of poll cheating are difficult to determine, I feel like we are on the cusp of an unprecedented, worldwide polling failure. In the years since Trump first announced his candidacy, his poll numbers have significantly risen in all major polls, both for Trump and Hillary. In fact, even as recently as last month Hillary's favorability rating remained at 58% and her net favorability rating remained at +29, indicating that Trump did not suffer any major poll drops in the months after announcing his campaign.

As I recently pointed out, Trump has been polling at or near 50% in the most recent polls for months. This is a level of success that most of us never saw Trump reach in 2014.

Additionally, the establishment media often appears to ignore the real issues affecting the American people. For months, Bernie Sanders has been gaining momentum with a surging millennial base, an extremely favorable millennial-to-millennial poll, and the fact that most millennials have no interest in voting for a candidate because most of the news they consume is about the elite of the United States.

Many polls have found that millennials are much less likely to support one of the two candidates for president that they identify with. In fact, if millennials vote for the Democratic candidate in a general election, they are predicted to do so for Clinton over Trump by 10 percentage points.

When you put all this together, I feel like we are rapidly approaching the point when a significant percentage of America's youth will choose to not vote. I have never seen a time in political history when voters were so disinterested in their politicians. This will likely continue to create a massive problem for the United States going into 2020.


If that is the case, one of the most likely outcomes could be the Republican Party imploding. It is a massive risk to take if a number of the GOP's candidates, particularly ones in states with heavy anti-establishment sentiments, are losing. It is also extremely unlikely, since polls tend to assume that voters are very interested in the candidates they are supporting. If it looks like Clinton is going to win the popular vote, many of Clinton's potential GOP challengers will most likely decide that they have no better options after all.


If the polls are all over the place, how will Trump do if that happens? Is he going to become a much more mainstream candidate or will he continue to make outrageous statements that will draw huge crowds and bring in voters who simply can't get excited about the choice between Hillary and anyone on the other side of the aisle?

Trump has a chance to be the first candidate to win both the Electoral College and the popular vote in presidential history. Given that we are in the midst of the largest election fraud in a generation, it has never been more important to educate ourselves on election fraud in order to ensure that our votes are accurately counted.

As a result, it is more important than ever to check the "scientific" polling sites out online. It could be the difference between a historic victory that will help make Hillary the first female president and a loss that will cause her to lose in a landslide.

I've seen more pictures of this car than a Lamborghini Egoista. I'm going to break the silence. This is the Ford GT. You might ask 'Whoa, hold up, who's Ford?' But I'm not talking about a company that's not making an F-150. I'm talking about another company that made the GT years ago, and I'm talking about an awesome car and amazing people. This is an F-150, but it's not that one. Not in the same way. And this is the result of a team of people at Ford that, while not making the F-150, and really not for many years, worked hard to create their own vehicle… a brand new one.

I'll be upfront. It's not perfect. When Ford first debuted the GT 50 years ago, it set the car apart. It wasn't a Ford, it was a Mustang. There were no badges, no wheels. It was just a Mustang. They didn't know it was a fast car when they first built it. It was built for the North American market and it was an F-model pony-car that needed a manual transmission. But it was something different. It was something with its own character.

Advertisement

If we break it down in a way that Ford understood, it all makes sense. The GT 50 was supposed to be the fastest Mustang ever made — the fastest Mustang built even. The car didn't need to be super-fast. It just needed to be fast in its own right. The car took off the fastest Mustang ever built. It was not just quicker than the Challenger, it was quicker than anything you could get. It was faster than the Ford GT with its big four, faster than Shelby's GT500 and the other pony cars. It was faster than this car. The fastest Mustang ever made.

At 50, the GT 50 is very much a 50-year-old car. It still holds up. Its numbers and performance remain on par with anything that comes on the market in a new year. Its age is what makes it special. In fact, Ford's engineering might be what keeps it special. It's just not a modern car. It's a Mustang that was designed in the '60s or '70s. It would have made an awesome GT car, but it would always be a Mustang. I think that's what's fun about it. We have that old school Mustang, because we have that old school engineers.

Advertisement

Now, why are you still reading? How is the car you're looking at, the car you just saw, the car above that you're so excited about, actually possible? I feel like I could buy one tomorrow and not just because of it being old. Even if it were new out of the box, and I just needed something fast, I'd get it. There's something nice about a car that feels like it's been there forever, because, really, that's what we do most of the time: we build old stuff.

The GT's old school attitude is at the core of the car. The classic Mustang's attitude is also present in the GT. It's in the rear end, on the grille, in the look of the hood and the hood scoop. It's the little things that get people's attention. It's the way a car handles. It's the way a car looks. It's the interior. It's the way a car sounds. It's the way a car feels. It's the engine. It's the transmission. It's the way the wheel climbs. It's the way the engine responds. It's the way the car corners. It's all those little things that make cars special that we know, by far, make the cars faster. In other words, these little things all take a GT and make it feel like the GT of 50 years ago.

Advertisement

The GT 50, at the time in 1972, was a unique vehicle. It was the first Mustang to be powered by a V8 — a big V8 — which was a big deal. It was the first Mustang to be built with an automatic transmission. It was also the first Mustang to get all-wheel drive, just three years after the GT40 was unveiled. But all the things I just told you about are old-school, too. This was special because it was something that Ford had seen as a future market and a future opportunity. It wasn't for the money and it didn't come cheap to buy. It was just a special day for Ford.

And there you have it. The GT 50. No, it wasn't ever as fast as this car. But the one thing about it I always say, is that Ford made one because they wanted to be part of history. Because they knew they never would make anything else. They don't make something simply because they think it's going to sell. In the old days
======================================== SAMPLE 33 ========================================
I'm a woman who finds myself in an awkward situation. I have an opinion and some research to back that opinion. I don't want to lose my job.

I'm a woman who doesn't find it necessary to write about my gender. I'm not a lesbian. The only men I know I'm dating are my boyfriend.

But I do have a job. And when I mention this, that's usually followed by a whole lot of "yeah but what about your job?"

And I'd like some perspective.

My opinion. The research. The research I was talking about. Who am I to have opinions about employment?

So it's time to call on the experts: the women in my workplace.

I'm talking about women across my network and the women I know who are also working in a professional and social setting. I'm talking about women in a wide variety of industries and occupations with wildly varying levels of experience (from mid-grade teachers to CEOs). And I'm talking about women who work in retail and retail-lifestyle-related businesses. I'm talking about women who serve as mentors and role models, who teach and teach others, who speak out on policy issues, and who are, in some way, a part of a solution to a problem that affects all women.

And I'm talking about women who don't work.

Here are some of those women on the issue:

"Many of my friends and colleagues, when they hear my comment, will often tell me, 'Your opinion doesn't matter, you're hired, just like everybody else,'" one women who teaches social studies said. "So if I have an opinion and I don't have any data to back it up, what could I possibly say? I'm always left wondering if I could say the same thing, or if I could, say, 'I have a good job, it's not what I'm doing.' If I just tell people that I have a good job, what is my point? I have to ask these questions and do research. And I still feel like I can only say 'yes' or 'no.'"

Another woman working in a professional field said she didn't feel she was able to raise her voice to her bosses and bosses' bosses about a lack of women in their professions: "As a first-generation college student, I was never exposed to that kind of language. My first experience was a 'no' and an acknowledgement that I knew I needed to study harder, but I was often given a vague sense that we needed to work on the issue."

Another woman, who works in the retail industry, said she didn't feel she had a platform, or ability, to talk about the issue, because her role is defined mostly by her physical characteristics: "My male peers have always treated the office situation differently at work. Male peers always seem to be in charge. They're always in charge of the budget, they always want the new thing, and I've noticed that females are constantly working as "experts." Male colleagues are always in charge. They want the new thing. They're always in charge of the budget. It's almost like there's a hierarchy in the office."<|endoftext|>Boeing's 787 Dreamliner can be made to carry a nuclear bomb on board, or the planes can carry nukes.

The Japanese carrier has a strict policy of avoiding weapons, and has said that any nuclear-powered plane designed for the Japanese market will not enter service.

"The Dreamliner, however, is being sold to a large customer as an aircraft that is capable of carrying a nuclear payload, and that is not the case," said Yasuhiro Takagi, a spokesman for Tokyo's Metropolitan Airports Authority (TMA), a branch of Tokyo's prefectural government.

The TMA regulates the sale of planes to airlines and the storage of weapons on planes. Boeing's decision to add the 787's nuclear capabilities has raised eyebrows in Japan because that aircraft is being offered for sale to a third country. The TMA does not comment on specific buyers but would not discuss this model.

The U.S. Senate intelligence committee wants a briefing from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency Director General Keith Alexander after a controversial NSA program that collects bulk phone data of U.S. citizens and foreign citizens worldwide came to light, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.


The NSA's secret domestic surveillance program, dubbed PRISM, and the Justice Department's attempt to force Apple to help its agents access data stored by the Cupertino company, have sparked outrage. The report cited a U.S. official as saying that both the Senate intelligence committee and the House intelligence committee, are examining the NSA program PRISM. The report was first published by Der Spiegel on Friday.


President Barack Obama on Monday defended the NSA's surveillance programs after reports emerged in the last few days that U.S. intelligence agencies had access to information from tech giants Facebook, Google, Apple and other tech giants that stored data about ordinary citizens.


"There are times where, just like in the 1950s, we don't know what privacy means. And I think we in a democracy need to reconcile having a set of principles and then applying them," the president told students in his last week in office.


"Somehow, in this digital age, we've managed to reconcile all these conflicting principles, and that's the challenge."<|endoftext|>The European Central Bank has opened its first major test of the digital currency bitcoin and its possible future use for clearing and settlement.

A trial of the European Payments Gateway (EPG), a new payment system, began in October in the ECB's testing grounds in Basel in Switzerland, as part of a larger program examining whether the blockchain, the distributed ledger used to authenticate payments, is technically capable of supporting financial services.

The EPG program will also test the blockchain's capacity to make payments faster with fewer fees than credit and debit cards.

The experiment will not be permanent, according to ECB Deputy Governing Council member Jörg Asmussen at an October 26 European Central Bank news conference. The experiment is expected to end as soon as January 2018, and the ECB will decide whether to keep the program going when that time comes, Asmussen said, according to Bloomberg.

It's not clear if the digital currency will be the solution to the speed issue, and while the central bank is aware that ethereum and bitcoin are among the projects working on solving that problem, it's still unclear if the new technology is the right answer, according to Bloomberg.

The EPG's technical hurdles include an open API that only the ECB can access, as well as a low "settlement fee" of 0.2 percent, according to a central bank statement.

However, the central bank is also trying to figure out whether digital currencies will be used in traditional banking systems, or if they could be used separately for financial services that need blockchain-like qualities, such as clearing and settlement, the central bank said.<|endoftext|>In the last couple weeks, the White House has launched a number of initiatives meant to "end gun violence." So far, however, there has not been much new on the topic. On Thursday, President Obama announced that the Department of Justice would create a task force to work on gun safety and said executive action was coming to curb gun violence. The following day, Vice President Biden released a list of measures, including gun trafficking sentencing enhancements, to curb gun violence. And on Tuesday, the White House announced a gun violence task force that included former Attorney General Eric Holder and Senator Dianne Feinstein.

Unfortunately, while the administration has taken a step forward with new actions, it faces some very big obstacles. For starters, these initiatives would effectively end current gun laws, as they would ban all existing gun sales, regardless of circumstances or whether or not they are a registered owner. Further, the White House has promised that these strategies will be pursued and "vigorously pursued" in Congress.

However, a bipartisan group of Senators led by Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner said "no thanks" to Obama's executive orders on gun safety, Politico notes.

Here is our summary of the various actions that Obama has taken and the problems to be overcome to have a serious and effective effort, or, if Congress is unwilling to act, to get a comprehensive approach taken.

Executive Actions

The Obama administration has taken several unilateral executive actions to "encourage further gun safety," Politico notes. The order was a follow-up to a series of executive actions that President Obama made when he took office in the White House, including: setting up a gun safety task force; releasing two guidelines to reduce gun violence; establishing a White House conference on guns; and creating a website to inform people how to be safer. The new executive order is to help with those tasks.

The new initiative includes:

New laws to ban bump stocks, military style weapons that can be used in "quick and semi-automatic" fashion.

If you are thinking of visiting the new museum dedicated to the works of Richard Mille, you will have to keep the date in mind. I'm sorry to tell you; the world's foremost authority on the works of Mille has decided to stop using his name. There have been rumors for some time that there was some kind of financial dispute, but I don't think that's it. I have just learned today that Mille would sooner have had the word 'Mille' permanently removed from the titles of his works and the names of all his heirs removed from the works in the museum. The problem is that if Mille is going to remove his name from his art then he also needs to remove it from the name. My best guess is that the heirs to the collections of his works are not the best people to be entrusted with the collections of the museum.


It's easy enough to find a replacement for them in the form of 'Richard Mille, The Artist.' The museum was named because Mille was a professor, but his teaching was so terrible that no one ever took up his invitation to visit his teaching studio. There is a famous line in the movie, 'A Christmas Carol,' 'We will not call it a museum, but a museum will name us.'


This is an opinionated blog post and I will be as blunt about it as I can possibly be. Mille might very well do well to follow the example of the wonderful art historian, John A. Mallory. I'm not sure the museum could survive having this individual as a part of its staff. If you think that is a problem then you are being a bit dramatic - I think it is a real and serious problem.


I'm sorry to be writing this post, but I want you to remember it for you and for Richard Mille. This is a museum whose name he created, where all of his works are housed, and to whose collections those works belong. And so it is unfortunate in that context that I have to say something about this decision to remove his name. I have come to accept that that will be my fate now, and so many people are going to have to suffer my having to say it. I will say only one thing: I don't think the issue here is about me. I believe that a real estate board is really an organization that is responsible to the community. And so I don't think that I is some kind of bogeyman or outsider. That is not my concern. I think that I am being treated like some sort of enemy, and I don't like it one bit. So for me there is nothing that is of greater importance than to know when I speak.


So please bear with me and remember this for you: I do not oppose your right to free speech. All I ask is that you keep it within the bounds of decorum and civility.


If you've read the comments on this particular post and you've been tempted to share your opinion about this matter, maybe I could offer you a helpful tip. As I said, I have decided to stop using these names because they are so unpleasant to use. You could start making fun of them by making fun of your favorite artist.<|endoftext|>If you are like me, I have one favorite color. I love it, and I know many others do too. When I see someone wearing a bright colored blazer, my heart pounds with joy. The color is so unique and so flattering to everyone. I know I will end up getting asked, "What do you wear to work?" At other work events, I am often asked, "How often do you get dressed up?" The thought of being asked such questions is quite scary. I also find the whole dress up stuff to be somewhat creepy. I'm not sure how many women have wondered why I am wearing my blazer when we go out drinking, since it makes me look so adult. I'm not sure how often you've wondered why I have a dark colored blazer (not orange) at a business job, when it would look so much better if I was dressed to go out on the town with my friends wearing my favorite color. How many times have you asked yourself, "Why is she doing that?" and "What is she thinking?" when you see a woman wearing something that "defines her" so strongly?

I have learned one thing from a lot of people over the years: There are no right or wrong choices when it comes to looks. In today's society, we live in a society where we are always told what to wear. We are taught how to dress and what not to wear by our parents, by what our peers wear, etc.. There is often no room for any other considerations. We are told what to look like, whether we believe we have that in us already or not. There are no other choices left, really. We are given no room to question or choose

There is no such thing as total control of information that are written on the Internet. Even if every government in the world was a computer and everything was being downloaded every second it is still impossible to completely get rid of any one person.

The Internet is an immensely powerful tool.

For example, even if the entire Internet was hacked into I could still find out about it, there are so many search engines online that it would be almost impossible for me to find out everything about everything. Even if the government can control information they would never get rid of all the information on the internet. The only way to truly control all of the information which is not on the Internet is to build some sort of censorship in place.

However, if they build a censorship method with the Internet, then they could completely get rid of information that is available without that censorship.

Just the fact that the government has a way to completely control internet content means that they must be getting full control of the Internet.<|endoftext|>The following is a list of minor details that are sometimes hidden, which are generally known by the staff but not everyone.

Characters Edit

The following characters are not seen in the game.

The following characters are not seen in the game's original Japanese release.

The following characters are not seen in the Japanese version of the game.

Battle Menu Edit

The Battle Menu is accessed by pressing the START button on the title screen. There are three ways to view the Battle Information.

1. A button on the right of the screen allows the player to switch between the main screen and the Battle Data screen. 2. A blue button (火) on the upper right of the screen allows the player to view character data. 3. A button (熱) on the upper right of the screen appears to be an option to view the status (HP, EXP, Level, Damage, etc.) of items.


Battle Data Edit

The Battle Data screen is accessed by pressing the SELECT button on the main screen. There is nothing of interest in the Battle Data screen - it simply displays the basic data for the character.

The following information is displayed in bold, and each number is shown as a percentage of that stat:

HP is divided into 40 points; the highest value will be at 100%.

MP is divided into 40 points; the highest value will be at 50%.

EXP is divided into 20,000 points; the highest is at 100%.

Damage is divided into 200 points; the highest one is 50%.

Status is a percentage of all health (HP): 0%-99%.

Level is divided into 40 points; the highest value will be at 100%.

Equipment Edit

Equipment are items that are used to strengthen a character's stats. Only one piece of equipment can be equipped at a time, but players can change their equipment after the battle ends.

As shown on the right side of the screen (with the character's equipment in italics), the character's level is used as the base for the number, but it can also be modified through the character's weapons (a weapon will always have the same strength value for the same type of equipment).

This data is also updated in the battle screen: the higher the character's level, the more damage they will do. The higher the weapon's level, the higher damage the weapons will do.

Characters Edit

There are a total of six characters in the game, each of whom has their own unique weapons and a color-coded type that is determined by rarity (green is common, yellow is uncommon, orange is rare, red is epic, and purple is legendary). The following is a list of all of the characters and how to obtain them.

Blue characters have the best chance of being obtained, since all enemies must be killed to acquire them. The number in parentheses in their rarity is how many times they appear in dungeons.

Toon Link

Toon Link's sword, Lon Lon Milk, is a Blue sword. It can be found in the second of the Sacred Grove dungeons.

Marth

Marth's sword is a Yellow sword. It can be found in the same dungeon as Lon Lon Milk.

Dark Pit

Dark Pit's sword is a Red sword. He can acquire one by completing the Cavern of Souls for the second time or defeating Dark Ridley.

Roy

Roy's sword is a Green sword. He can acquire one by completing the Dark World, or by defeating Dark Moltor.

The most recent episode of Survivor, Kaoh Rong, features the elimination of former Survivor contestant Russell Hantz. We are already in the process of dissecting it for every conceivable angle, but that will have to wait. The following week, in which Russell is allowed to compete in the "Kaoh Rong: Game Changers" reunion special, I can only hope for the best.

What are some of the reasons for Russell to want to come back? Who is playing his best game at the moment? What can we expect from him on "Game Changers"? Let's get to it!

I don't think Russell has been as honest and open about his thoughts on how he's playing as he has been in past seasons. So far, his approach has been to keep his emotions in check, to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone further, and just go out there and play the game. This is not the guy we saw in "Blood vs. Water." You can tell that he has thought this through in the past and that this could be his last chance to win one and maybe play a second time, so I think he is being very careful about who knows what. Maybe that is a good strategy.

Is Russell trying to change how he plays the game? I don't know. But I wouldn't be shocked if he does get caught up in more drama. He's been an arrogant jerk for a long time now. I don't think he is going to change that.

As I have been saying all along is that Russell's game has completely changed when it comes to Millennials. He has to play to get out of this game faster and he has to play his strongest alliance this season. It is not going so great for him right now with his alliance with Michelle and Tai. But I also think the way that the Millennials are playing this season is very interesting and has been very strategic for them. The big challenge has been to find their hidden immunity idol and, I think, they have it, though not quite yet. I think it is going to come down to trust between them and their alliance or the alliance of Jessica and Zeke. That is what really matters with this season. I think that they are all close to being at the point where they can be "the five" and that is going to create a lot of drama and alliances.

I don't think Russell is on the bottom of this season. I think he is a very strong threat. I think with the changes to the way this game is played in the next two to three weeks, you are going to see a lot more "Russell Hantz" style gameplay if he has to.

Last week was very interesting. So much so that it is hard to believe that this season is going to really be anything similar. As the host of a "One World, One Survivor" podcast series, I feel the responsibility to give readers and viewers all the information they need to make really informed decisions in coming weeks.

That being said, I do have one more reason for Russell to be here. The "One World, One Survivor" podcast podcast series is my second podcast. In fact, it was my first podcast ever. When the podcast series began, the goal was to start up a new podcast every week for a total of 30 weeks. It wasn't meant to be a weekly television show. That was just sort of a fun side-project idea.

Now, the goal for the podcast is to help viewers get better insights on some of the hidden and not-so-hidden stories of the season, which they can be sure to find out about if they don't tune into the podcast. So I am hoping that after listening to this week's podcast, anyone who is not watching "Survivor" and who hasn't looked into the "Survivor: Game Changers" podcast series will take the time to do so.<|endoftext|>We've seen it before, but we're excited to see a new version of Microsoft Flight.

The National Football League's New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons will play Saturday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, and a host of people are going to be upset about it.

Why? Well, because it's an unusual matchup that has a "hostile" vibe for many football fans in New Orleans and Atlanta because it's the fourth consecutive Thanksgiving game in the city, and the fifth NFL game since 2013 — one with a home team playing without a home city — that's been called "hostile."

While this may be an unusual game to call "hostile," we are not the first to point out how many games have been called "hostile" since last year (and there have been numerous more since then). In fact, we are the fifth consecutive article in the past four months to highlight other Thanksgiving games that were the recipient of the designation.

The list includes:

• Cowboys-49ers Week 1 2012

• Buccaneers-Saints Week 6 2015

• Panthers-Lions Week 7 2015

The film is an account of the actions of Canadian special forces operating in northern Afghanistan during the winter of 2005/2006. I have read several accounts of the same events; these may be summarized in four short passages here, in order that you do not miss anything.

The Canadian Special Operations Forces (CSF) team from the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (the PPC) is dispatched to a remote area in northern Afghanistan, to a village inhabited by local Taliban militants and their supporters. They travel in convoy of two Canadian Armed Personnel Carriers (CAPC), which carry at least seven soldiers, a medic, a vehicle commander and three weapons.

The team arrives at the village. According to the team leader, a number of Afghan villagers were trying to flee the area. At this time in September, 2005 there was no sign of any coalition airstrikes by night or day.

At this point in the film, I saw the video. Apparently, the video was made in November 2005 or early 2006, and the village was in the process of being blown up by ground and air forces – I do not know if it was by U.S. planes, or Russian. This action may have killed or injured many Afghan villagers, including the team leader. The soldiers' lack of protective gear and the improvised explosive devices that had been planted in the village do not help their situation.

The team leader orders a mortar round thrown from the top of a helicopter. The mortar round is meant to clear cover from the Taliban, if there is any. It also is possible that the team leader himself may have been killed as a result of his efforts.

As the team moves closer to the village, gunfire erupts – but no one comes to help. The team leader returns fire. It is the beginning of a mission in a "fire fight", in which two soldiers are killed, some of the insurgents killed or wounded.

At about this point of the film, the Taliban are said to have gathered in a nearby house. The Afghan villagers apparently are fleeing. A few gunshots of machine-gun fire and explosions and a few women come to the rescue of those who are trying to escape the area.

The team leader says to his team-mate in Russian, "let's move in", and starts moving his team-mates to the roof of the home that the villagers are occupying.

I am very much interested in the role that the Canadians were playing, but this is a story for another post.

The following are the four brief quotations that I remember from the Canadian army website that describe the incident. The text is from the Canadian Forces Combat Camera.

As part of Operation REASSURANCE, 4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, the 1st Canadian Division conducted an early morning ambush during a village engagement in Northern Afghanistan in May, 2005. Canadian troops were able to locate and eliminate an enemy outpost in a residential house, whilst insurgents were firing on a nearby village and their outpost was successfully repulsed.

"During pre-deployment training, our snipers are in-country for three weeks and this includes 3-D training, live fire training, and night operations," said Senior Non-commissioned Officer (NCO) Jason McIlveen, the team leader. "It is important to train for this type of scenario."

The PPC was the first Canadian unit to train extensively in

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was fined $2,500 yesterday for his comments that appeared to have been directed at the referees during Sunday's 30-27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, NFL officials said today.

In an interview after the game, the 27-year-old Brady said the referees were making "terrible calls" during his team's 30-13 loss. He said they were "always looking the other way" in other games, too.

"Every time we get the ball in our hands, they're trying to call a penalty on us," Brady said. "This is the easiest thing in the world to do. But for some reason, sometimes it just kind of gets stuck, if you ask me."

He said he didn't believe anyone was really making bad calls and said the referees just had to "know better" before the end of the game. He also accused the officials of favoring the Rams.

"We're going to give it to 'em, they're going to give it to 'em, but we are doing our level best to give it to 'em," Brady said. "They're always looking the other way in this league, that's why."

New England head coach Bill Belichick, one of the league's favorite coaches, was equally furious with how the rest of the game was officiated. Belichick said he felt Brady's comments were disrespectful.

"I was really, really disappointed in how that went," Belichick said. "I really was. I have great respect and love for him as a coach. He's had so many phenomenal seasons. And the kind of comments that he made are not appropriate to anybody in this room. It's just very wrong."<|endoftext|>A British newspaper outlet has published what may be the first interview with ISIS' leader – and we're not talking about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the man pictured above.

The Sunday Times, the UK's biggest-selling paper, published a story titled "The Caliph is living life to the full. His eyes tell you about his life". The article featured a video interview, conducted by an unnamed British journalist, with the self-proclaimed caliph. It went on to provide other details, including an alleged interview with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which was also published Monday by the ISIS-affiliated Daily Mirror.

The video, which has been widely viewed on YouTube, is purportedly of an interview with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Abu Duaa al-Britani, an Iraqi who lived in Syria and swore allegiance to al-Baghdadi during the last days of the US occupation of Baghdad. Abu Duaa said Baghdadi "looks younger than his years" and "has his hands and body covered in an extravagant moustache, and he wears a beard with a distinctive white streak".

In the interview, Baghdadi is in his early 30s, dressed in a military uniform and carrying a Kalashnikov rifle and a pistol. His wife, a woman of "stunning beauty" who has "a strong character", says that he is "a man of peace".

A British journalist interviewing Baghdadi

In response to questions from the journalist, the caliph – who is the leader of the group of fighters known as Islamic State – says that his "mission is not to talk to the media", and says that Baghdadi is "not going anywhere." His voice cracks as he describes Baghdadi's "dreams."

"The dream is that everyone should join the Islamic system", Baghdadi says. "What I want for the Islamic system is unity and cooperation," he says. "As I have seen many times in my life, when we cooperate there are benefits for both sides. So I see my dream as reaching people and working to help unite them."

The interview is said to have started on 4 February this year, when Abu Duaa was contacted by the British journalist "in an anonymous phone call".

The British journalist met with Abu Duaa first at the camp he had established in Syria to train fighters in the use of modern weapons and explosives. He followed the caliph on his way to an area called Tel Abyad which he claimed had been taken from the "Turkish army".

Once he reached the battlefield, according to the reporter, Baghdadi "spoke in a very calm tone, very humble". He "recalled" the time when he was "in prison in Mosul" and said: "Now I see Mosul like a second paradise."

When asked about his wife, who the woman says had a "strong character" until recently "when she lost the confidence in herself, she made a lot of mistakes", Baghdadi replies: "I am very happy with her."

It is here that Baghdadi tells the interviewer that he hopes to get married, and that he was engaged when he was in prison. He says that he wants

In the last few days, I read a couple of interesting articles and tweets about "the age of the robot". The first one was about the age of artificial intelligence and the second one was about the birth of the "Age of Robots". In the last paragraph of the article I realized that the robot was a man, a super-human in every sense. In my previous article, "The Age of Machines", I made some interesting comments about the "Age of Machines". The comment I left back then was that the next few decades will witness the development of a new technology that will have profound global consequences. The question was whether or not such events ever can be prevented in our lifetimes, especially if artificial intelligence or "robotic automation" is able to replace many of the human jobs in our society.

It turns out that there are not only a couple of interesting articles and blog postings about the "age of the robot" but also a couple of interesting tweets that can prove this prediction true! The article from the New York Times is entitled "The Age of the Robot" and its author is Nate Silver. He is a data scientist, not a philosopher. Yet his piece is an excellent exposition of how the "Age of the Robot" will affect our society.

The article begins with a quote by Sir Arthur C. Clarke about the development of our present-day technology:

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the long run we are all dead.

To put these words in a slightly different form:

"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the long run, we are all dead."

The quote from Sir Arthur is followed by a sentence from Charles Dickens, that in my opinion is the best quotation about technology from any writer:

"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the long run, we are all dead."

The article then proceeds to describe how technology is changing our human societies:

"The biggest risk is that automation will cause unprecedented wealth and leisure for the "1%", who have the technology, wealth, and education."

The article then tells us that in recent years, more and more people have been talking about the dangers of automated technology on many of the world's cities. In particular, there is a real trend in many developed countries, namely the increasing displacement of workers by technology with very little or no notice to the workers.

The article then describes how in countries like Germany, Sweden and the US where robots are replacing humans, the cost of living has increased dramatically. The article also comments that in the US between 1950 and 2000 there was a net tax increase to the taxpayers from US citizens in order to give the money to pay for the new technology being created in the US, the same with other developed countries.

The article then describes how artificial intelligence and automation technology allows a company to hire someone a job that once was occupied by a human being, eliminating his or her previous responsibilities and duties. If the new employee works on robots, the company pays almost no tax, even as he is providing a service to the company, the benefits of which are almost free of cost to him. This, it would seem, is a very good illustration of our economic system's current model where a corporation's main goal is to be as profitable as possible and not worry about its workers.

The article ends with a final quote from the author "The Age of the Robot", referring to those who have already foreseen the danger of "the Age of the Robot".

"Those who predicted that robots would take our jobs never mentioned that in many cases we already have robots that are taking over some of our jobs."

The article is a very well-written and informative one when it comes to the topic of robotics and the consequences that this new technology will bring.

What do you think about this article on the "Age of the Robot"? Let me know in the comments below.

In some cases, the costumes are funny — people are pretending to be superheroes out of fun! In other cases, the costumes are very, very bad; people are dressed as famous villains, and one of the people is literally a rapist.

An Irish couple who were in the passenger bed of a car that overturned at the New Year's Eve festivities in the Austrian capital have been rescued alive and well.

The couple, who have not been named, were trapped under the car for hours while the driver managed to get himself and the vehicle safely away from the scene of the accident in central Vienna.

It came days after more than 900 people died as a result of a stampede as revellers got into the stampede on the city's festive eve fireworks display.

But after the accident in the Austrian capital, the pair are now on their way home.

The Irishwoman was initially confirmed dead as the couple did not have their pulse for some time, while the couple's three children managed to reach them, a spokesperson for the interior ministry in Austria confirmed to Independent.ie.

Their condition was confirmed as stable in hospital after emergency emergency crews took them to the hospital.

The three children were sent back to Ireland to be reunited with their parents after the incident.

The woman was a 28-year-old woman from Ballina in Co Mayo. Her name was withheld for legal reasons.

The man was a 36-year-old man from Ballynahinch in Co Meath.

It is believed they were in a parked car on an Austrian-Italian street when the accident occurred.

The car came to rest in a residential area in Vienna. No-one was injured during the accident, police said.

A woman whose identity remains unknown was the owner of the car and was driving it at that time, Vienna police confirmed to AFP.

Police told local media that they are investigating possible charges in relation to the collision, according to local reports.<|endoftext|>A man in an orange shirt and blue jeans was taken to Harborview Medical Center after taking a shot in the head in one of the downtown buildings.

The man was still breathing when Seattle police arrived, witnesses said.

Police don't plan to lay charges because there are indications that the man was acting in self-defense, they say.

Frederica Wilson (D-FL). Rep. Wilson's account of a phone call between the President and the wife of a fallen U.S. soldier created the latest flare-up in the heated presidential campaign.

"In your actions on Monday, you have created a crisis of confidence for all Americans who value their democratic institutions and democratic values. In this difficult moment, we believe that you owe the president of the United States an apology," the letter said.

While the Congressional Black Caucus did not state their specific demands, the letter to Trump said, "we call on you to issue a full and immediate public apology to Rep. Wilson, an apology that respects the dignity of all Americans and recognizes the sacrifices of all our soldiers who have sacrificed so much to keep our country safe."

The letter was signed by the entire caucus.

Wilson appeared on Tuesday's edition of CBS It's The Morning Show with Matt Lauer to respond to the letter, defending the Black Caucus members' positions as well as Rep. Wilson's actions. Wilson went out of her way to explain, what she saw as her motivations for writing the letter.

"When this happened, it was an honor and a privilege to be able to sit in that chair. It's a privilege, and a responsibility, because when you are sitting in that chair, the President of the United States walks in that door, walks out of that door, and, you know, people say, what does he think? You know what? You walk out and you have to say something," Wilson said.<|endoftext|>If you had a problem with your credit card, you can't always get a full refund of the difference between your purchase and the advertised price. That's because your credit card company may make its own markups to ensure you don't get ripped off by merchants. If you want a complete refund or partial refund, you'll have to file a chargeback.

Chargebacks are claims that merchants made to credit card companies after the amount of money they were charged was too high. As we've said before, however, the process is relatively easy. You simply go and prove your case with the help of a credit card chargeback dispute form and the credit card company. Once you've presented all of the evidence necessary to prove a chargeback, your credit card company will initiate arbitration of the dispute as described in this post,

A few months ago, an article in The New York Times was met with a chorus of "meh." In hindsight, maybe it was right after all? In any case, my colleague Eric Toms, along with a couple of his colleagues, decided to get to the bottom of it all. So here are the original articles by Toms and his colleague and a few helpful observations from The Times:

The Times report includes the following:

An editorial page editor for The Times declined to name the woman but said that she was a columnist who had been writing for the paper for more than a decade . . .

The Times story went on to list three other women who are now identified in the story.

In a comment to Eric Toms' story , reader Bob H. asked if the Times is currently looking into allegations by multiple women:

I'm confused about the NYT interview where they were clear that three had been named. I have a copy of the article, but in the article it reads "three women" with no other detail.

Hmmm.

I have no idea what the Times is doing or who would have responsibility for the women at the paper, the one I worked for, or anyone else named in this story. I just want the truth out there.

Thanks Bob

I've received quite a few comments after posting of the Toms' piece about how this person at the NYT could make a clear case that some other unnamed people were named in the original New York Times article. What's wrong with me?

I think this is a great question. As someone who was once associated with working at the NYT , I can testify to the fact that, for many people there, this person in the top brass of the print edition is not the person who really knows what's really going on. And that's not because he is secretly a jerk. It's because for many in the newspaper biz, it's a place of extreme pride to work at. It's a public forum where the only goal is the truth. But at the same time, it's one of the most important public forums, so it's a strange confluence of feelings between reporters and editors.

It's a common story for women to come forward to the paper. The paper doesn't always do well with these stories. Remember when Janet Cooke made her sex tape public? Or when Judith Miller did a major story exposing the role of the White House and the Clintons in the Monica Lewinsky scandal? The paper's "we're always looking for those stories" credo just doesn't do the paper any favors.

And here's the thing: The paper is owned by the same company (Gannett) where I had spent the majority of my journalism career (more than 16 years total) -- a company that has never done much for women or gay employees.

I spent a lot of time at my editor's office at Gannett, and I can relate that when a story is strong we generally are able to get other stories picked up elsewhere because it can be a challenge to get a lot of attention and public scrutiny for just one story. The one thing about the New York Times and my New York Times experience is that when editors are comfortable about their stories, they tend to want to publish them. I can tell you that on many occasions I left the paper's office feeling more emboldened than I went in.

Still, in fairness to the people with the most power and responsibility at the NYT -- the two people who are most responsible for the safety of the city's most vulnerable people -- Toms' report seems fairly damning. As we all know, when powerful people make sexual allegations against the weak, all of us are affected. I think that's a pretty good summary of the NYT's handling of the situation, with a few minor exceptions.

I will just close with the following two thoughts I had just writing this article:<|endoftext|>About This Content A new expansion for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call Of Pripyat, adding a brand new area, new missions, new animals and equipment, and a host of new challenges, quests, achievements, items and more!

(CNN) This is one of the most important legal challenges to emerge in years -- a fight to protect children in the foster care system.

A group of children who'd been in foster care -- largely African-American, and at the center of the case -- are now standing up to be heard.

A court hearing on August 14 will decide whether the state can keep them in custody. It would be a crushing blow for the civil rights community that has long fought to protect children in the state system of foster care.

On one side of the courtroom, there are civil rights attorneys and leaders like Daunasia Yancey, who is suing the state to stop the children's placement in a federally funded facility to be housed with other kids.

On the other side are a number of foster parents from around the country fighting to keep their kids in the care of the state. They're all in the courtroom to make their argument.

The logo's creators had to change it because its image was making people feel uncomfortable.

That was the "conversation" that took place between EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), just as the group was creating its new logo.

We were discussing ways to redesign the ACLU logo when I realized it wasn't "right." I was worried that some folks in attendance would come out of the conversation not liking the new logo, even though I believe in it.

We got to discuss it even more, discussing how the ACLU logo needs to be designed for a certain group of people.

Here is some of what we agreed on:

The ACLU symbol needs to be used for a certain group of people. It's not something that can be shared widely. We needed to design the logo specifically to help the people we serve make sense of our work for them.

I think this is why some people didn't approve the new one: It doesn't communicate its purpose clearly enough.

For example, what does the ACLU mean to the world? It's not an abstract symbol that stands for a set of values such as freedom of expression and diversity. Instead, many use this symbol not as a stand-alone statement, but as a way to communicate some key message for their organization.

The old logo made very little sense as a brand. Its lack of clarity meant people didn't know how they could find out more information about the ACLU.

The new logo has a lot more content than the old one. The logo should tell a story (not a set of ideas), which is what makes it a perfect fit for the new mission of the organization.

What is clear with this logo is that the people served by the ACLU are people who deserve to be heard (and protected) in times of need. If you are a human rights advocate and would like to support the American Civil Liberties Union as a nonprofit, please consider donating to the ACLU to help us fight for our values, protect people and prevent injustice. Or you can visit us online. We can't do it without your support.

I have a feeling this "conversation" was very fruitful — but it didn't happen on the day it was supposed to! And this is why I feel we need to keep going.<|endoftext|>The new, improved iPhone 7 is the one to beat. It's the biggest, baddest iPhone yet — and it's got a huge battery, too.

(Seth Wenig/AP)

There's something almost magical about watching the Cubs beat the Indians.

For one thing, if there was ever an example of how baseball is an equalizing force on us all, it's that day in Cleveland. With the Cubs' 10-0 rout the Indians were suddenly on the ropes after a strong start, to the point where they had to call upon a pinch-hitter to make an appearance at third base.

Then there's the scene in the seventh inning where the Indians are up 11-0. Outfielder Eric Jagielo, a former teammate of Chicago star Kris Bryant, flies out to left. The fans around the diamond erupt.

In the first episode of "The Simpsons" Season 19, "Bart the Genius," Homer watches the Cubs win 11-7 over the Indians in Cleveland to become World Series champs. His comments after the game sound eerily like the one heard here:

When the NBA announced its 2013 All-Star Weekend rosters this week, there were no players on an Eastern Conference roster that wasn't also from the Los Angeles Clippers.

The Clippers came within one game of finishing as one of the top two seeds in the East last season, but ultimately finished fourth. Chris Paul, Paul Pierce, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan will be on the All-Star East team, joining the likes of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James, with the Clippers looking to improve on a 20-53 record coming off last season.

The West teams are much more likely to make the playoffs, but that will be determined by which team earns the right to host the All-Star Skills Competition in New York on Jan. 18, 2014, just one year after hosting the event in Memphis and Memphis again in 2013.

I've created this to be a list of all the possible options for how to run the default configuration of the Raspberry Pi with a 16GB SD card, a keyboard and mouse, and an HDMI monitor. This is meant to be a base set of equipment to get up and running. Feel free to create your own custom setup. I'll try and keep it up to date with as much information as I can find. This is not a configuration guide.

Prerequesites

1. If you are intending to use a monitor that supports hdmi, a USB 2.0 graphics card is required if you want to use raspbian at all on your Raspberry Pi. The first raspbian image I used did not include a monitor and there was a huge time lag during setup, and sometimes not until the end of the day. So, install an hdmi driver which will solve most of those problems. There are many places to download this driver, but I have a copy here from the Raspberry Pi Foundation itself.

2. If you currently have an SD card that is the same size as your pi and you want to install a new drive, it cannot be an older model with less than a gigabyte. You cannot remove the old drive and then install a new drive which can be as small as a megabyte. So be sure to use an SD card that is the same size for the entire setup. You will then add that to the list of choices below.

3. If you've just added an SDHC card, you will probably want one where the filesystem is either ext4, FAT or ntfs. The Raspberry Pi foundation states that both of these options are available in the default image, and so I'll default you to that. If you have a new card that is not listed here, I'm sure you can find a version of raspbian that suits your needs.

4. If you're on Windows, please install the Windows drivers for your card and the monitor so you can setup with it running in full HD resolution. It's nice to be able to use a full resolution monitor in a virtual environment.

5. If you're installing on a Mac, get a USB mouse or mouse pad as well and your will need one that supports multi-button mouse clicks.

6. You may also be able to work with your SD card via the serial port, but this requires more set-up, and could potentially harm your card. If you choose to try this, you will likely be better off using the HDMI cable for better image quality. If you need a cable of any kind, be sure to read this page as well to see how to use the Raspberry Pi's HDMI to SD adapter.

7. Download and extract the latest image from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. You have two options here. You can download the image as a zip from the raspberrypi.org website, or you can download individual raspian images from the forum thread.

8. If you're using the image from the forum, use this image to setup as per the instructions there.

9. If you haven't downloaded the image yet, use this image to download. Extract the image using Win32 Disk Imager, and then double click on the image to mount it on your desktop.

10. Plug your SD card into the Raspberry Pi, and into your monitor. Make sure the USB device is plugged in before you boot the install process and check that it is correctly connected. If you're not sure what USB device it is, simply plug and unplug your USB device until you get an error while checking that it's connected correctly. This might require that you disconnect the USB device from your computer's system power first.

11. Make sure your computer is powered on, keyboard and mouse are properly connected, and the Raspberry Pi is connected to the monitor.

12. Once you see a new menu for configuration, make a note of where it is located in the future, or at least the name of it. It is not necessary to go into the configuration screen to make changes, in fact, it's usually best to disable the configuration screen.

13. You might get a warning when booting up that shows that something is not right with the Raspberry Pi. It only lasts a few seconds, and it will get better over time.

14. Once booting up, you will only have one screen to work on.

15. Select "Raspbian Jessie Lite".

16. The default username, password and login name will be your Raspbian installation name, with a default name of 'pi' on the Raspberry Pi. If you choose this menu option, the default raspbian login name will be 'pi'. If you choose to change or add a name, be sure to edit the pi user file: nano /etc/passwd, and add a new entry for your name.

Roughly half a dozen Republican legislators from Maryland have joined with Democrats to urge President Trump to stop pushing legislation that they believe would create a discriminatory legal path for Muslims.

"Our Democratic colleagues are united on this matter," said Sen. Robert A. Zirkin, a Montgomery County Democrat who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "But we don't have the full, bipartisan support of the president. That's why we have stepped up to lead."

Zirkin is one of more than a half-dozen Maryland lawmakers who signed a letter sent Wednesday to the president. The letter was signed by Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin, Jr., the Maryland senator, and Gary C. Peters, the Democratic congressman from Baltimore County.

The lawmakers wrote that they recognize that they cannot influence federal legislation, and that they "strongly support President Trump's executive orders." But they noted that they oppose "the current legislative proposal that creates a new pathway to citizenship."

Zirkin said that he has been in communication via email with Trump's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and legislative affairs staff, and that that they have encouraged him to change his views on the issue.

"They're concerned," Zirkin said of the staffers. "If they can't stop the president on legislation, they can at least try to keep the president off the subject."

The Senate passed the controversial immigration order last month, but only after it was modified by the House to include an exemption for those who have become citizens of the United States as a result of being raised in the country. The final version of the legislation still gives them a path to citizenship, and Zirkin said he intends to introduce a new Senate version of the bill in January.

But he and other Maryland lawmakers noted that the president's order does not require a path to citizenship for those who were born in the United States.

If the final House-Senate conference agreement on immigration legislation is ever made public, Zirkin said, "we want to make sure the provisions that were added, if there is an exemption, actually reflect the concerns of the governor of Maryland and the other lawmakers on the Senate and the House."

"He's clearly concerned," Zirkin said of the president. "He was very helpful, and I'm sure in the coming days, he's going to continue to be very helpful."

Sen. Brian E. Frosh, a Baltimore County Democrat, also signed the letter, along with Sen. Richard S. Madaleno, an Anne Arundel County Democrat, Sen. J.B. Jennings, a Montgomery County Democrat, and Sen. Joan Carter Conway, a Howard County Democrat.

They wrote that they also oppose the "current proposal that creates a new pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants" and "the current legislative proposal that creates a new avenue for immigrants to gain green cards."

They wrote that they believe this legislative proposal violates federal law.

"The proposed legislation, if signed into law, will make our state and country less safe and more divided," they wrote.

Some Maryland Democrats have already vowed to oppose any bill that does not provide for a pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants, but Frosh said no matter what happens, he intends to continue opposing the legislation. Frosh said he expects that there will be a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the legislation at some point.

"I'm just getting started," he said.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan supports a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally, but Zirkin and other Maryland Democrats are hoping to build pressure on Hogan to veto the legislation. Last year, Hogan signed a "show me your papers" measure into law that requires police officers to ask people about their immigration status without first looking at their papers.

According to the letter, Maryland senators and congressmen do not intend to withhold their votes from the next Maryland budget, but want to make it clear that the legislation is not good policy.

"If you make it harder for these immigrants to qualify for legal status, you make it harder for them to get to work and stay with us," Zirkin said.

Senate Majority Leader Catherine E. Pugh, a Baltimore County Democrat, said that she has received assurances from Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., a Montgomery County Democrat, and the chairmen of the three Maryland congressional delegations – Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, the top Democrat in the House; Del. John Delaney, the No. 3 Democrat in the House and Rep. Chris Van Hollen, another top House Democrat – that they will oppose any bill that includes citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally.

"This is absolutely not how you pass legislation into law," Pugh said.

Maryland lawmakers also plan to meet with Van Hollen to discuss his opposition to the bill.

A video showing a British Airways flight being disrupted last month with a bomb scare has been released by US intelligence sources.

Investigators say that they are not ruling out the possibility that the incident at JFK airport in New York was caused by a bomb.

The footage, shown to reporters on Thursday, shows armed TSA agents rushing the jet to make sure no explosives were on board.

The flight to Zurich from Heathrow was diverted back to Boston when it landed at 3pm on 26 September.

The British Airways jet was diverted back to Boston (file picture pictured) last month when it landed at 3pm on 26 September

Three hours into the diversion, the jet was cleared to land back in Boston at around 4pm.

But after the plane had landed, it made an emergency landing because security officers had found a small device apparently in the lavatory area.

The flight landed in New York at around 10pm, and was met on the tarmac by an armed escort of FBI agents.

There were no signs of a bomb or any damage to the aircraft.

The FBI and the Transportation Security Administration were able to track the black box flight data recorder, which logged flight information through the aircraft and the ground control.

The black box flight data recorder is housed in a room at JFK airport.

The device is a laptop and was found on the flight in the lavatory of the plane. It was later delivered back to Baa, an air storage company based in Boston.

The flight from Boston landed back in Boston (file picture) at around 10pm, and was met on the tarmac by an armed escort of FBI agents

Investigators said that the device appears to have been placed inside the lavatory by an individual who had been on the flight for about an hour.

The FBI and TSA are currently working together to identify the individual who placed the device, but are also working to rule out any possibility that the event was a hoax.

They said that, so far, there is not much evidence of terrorism that played a role in the event, but are trying to put together the clues so their investigation can continue.

The FBI has sent the device to the National Bureau of Standards, a division of the Department of Energy, to determine if it is a threat to public safety.

The company that manages the terminal at JFK, National Airlines, is cooperating with the investigation and has been cooperating with federal investigators.<|endoftext|>In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey that is wreaking havoc on a devastated Texas and Louisiana in the US, it's clear that the Trump administration could really use some good luck. For the first time in a year, President Trump hasn't held a public rally to rally with supporters for hurricane relief. It's clear that, to a man and a woman, the President doesn't understand his own country and its citizens, and his administration could really use some good luck in these parts.

After all, the United States has now lost five-and-a-half million Americans in disasters and the number of Americans in Texas is estimated to be as high as 30,000 in the most urgent need of help by the President and his top team. The president has repeatedly demonstrated that he's never understood what needs to be done and what is worth the effort to fix, but it looks like he's about to get lucky.

According to reports from the White House this evening, the President plans to call the President of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rosselló, within the next day or so, to thank him and help him get his head around the disaster which is now killing or hurting tens of thousands in his hurricane-ravaged homeland.

This is a welcome and much-needed step for Trump, especially when you consider that the administration is still struggling with the fallout from the failure to respond to the disaster in Puerto Rico and has yet to put forth an adequate disaster response plan.

President Trump will certainly want to avoid the pitfalls he experienced earlier this month when the White House refused to accept the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, a man who has arguably been more qualified to be at the head of the NSC than any of the White House officials currently in that position; and he was replaced by Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a man with a strong background in the US Army, a man who has been described as a "fiery firebrand loyal to President Donald Trump". It looks like Trump's luck might be about to run out.<|endoftext|>From a recent post at the Economic Policy Institute:

The number and proportion of households with children is still declining in the United States. According to the 2014 CPS, 15 percent of children lived with both employed parents, the lowest on record since 1976. The decline represents the slowest progress in child poverty in 40 years. This trend stems primarily from the rise in single-parent households.

In 1970, 17 percent of children lived with one employed parent. Now the figure is

This is the second article in a series of articles exploring the role of media literacy and the web in the development of a well-informed citizenry. The first article discussed the role TV, books and the press play in influencing what people think and believe.

The idea of a hyper-informed society is often bandied about without adequate evidence: why are some people better informed than others about issues as important as the economy? How can a nation be truly great when it has so little knowledge of its own existence? (see "Why does the world revolve around us: Understanding the role of media and the web in global governance.")

As media literacy grows, these questions may finally be addressed. However, in their current state, media literacy education programs focus on a few aspects of public discourse: how to tell your story well, why media matters and how to navigate it.

In many countries, media is a central source of information for citizens, but it is also a powerful medium, capable of communicating complex information in a manner that is easy to read and process. This raises the question: Why are more and more people not knowing more?

Why isn't information spreading online as quickly as it is elsewhere? There is no question that the internet has become an important resource for the advancement of knowledge. This is especially true in the current climate of technological disruption.

Yet, for all of the potential of the internet, internet usage remains much lower in rural areas as compared to urban areas. With low internet connectivity comes a scarcity of new information, in many cases because of the high cost of a telephone call. The cost of a traditional news outlet tends to be lower than internet access, both in the immediate sense of price and longer term, as they have a greater time frame on a regular basis.

It is a difficult situation. How do we overcome the problem without simply giving up on public media? Perhaps a new paradigm is on the horizon. Perhaps we will see a global network of "hyperliterate" citizens in the new millennium, where information is freely available but it is also accessible at a quick, affordable and accurate pace.

I'm a technology guy and, as far as I'm concerned, information is king. I believe media is the most potent medium we have as a society that should be used constantly and with the highest degree of integrity and scrutiny. I also believe that education is critical in this day and age.

The Problem With "Hyperliteracy"

In the mid-1990s, when the American Library Association launched the "Hyperliteracy Study," an academic study to determine the optimal educational curriculum, one of the major issues it addressed focused on media literacy, specifically how to teach it.

Some educators viewed education only as reading or learning how to pass a standardized test and were not well versed with the issues of media. Others didn't see the value in educating students about the importance of media literacy and were uncomfortable with their role as gatekeepers to information. Others just didn't have time to focus on something which is so time consuming. There was also the fact that most of the work was being done outside of schools in schools of social work and school of journalism, many of which taught in print journalism methods, and students needed to know how to read to find the answers they were looking for.

When I heard the term hyperliteracy, it caused me to take notice. "Hyper" is a powerful word. It is the basis for an entire series and, in a way, I became obsessed with it. I read everything I could about the topic. I visited organizations and learned about the subject.

The result is that I am now a well versed reader of print and digital media. I do this because the issues I discussed in my first article, "Why is the world revolving around us: Understanding the role of media and the web in global governance," still apply today.

What did the study discover? The American Library Association identified 22 media-specific competencies that are necessary to be hyperliterate: the ability to tell a simple story or piece of information in a timely manner, communicate information clearly and effectively, understand cultural and political values of various sources, understand and apply social and cultural information, and interpret the impact of different media and mediums.

While most of these skills and competencies are important, it also included 21 core competencies, which were important to educators as a result of the study: knowledge of literature and/or culture, social responsibility, media literacy, interpersonal skills (communication, leadership, problem solving), time management, and the value of self-expression as well as teamwork.

The American Library Association published a full summary of each competency in 2002 in its magazine, Hypercritical.

The American Library Association also determined that students who scored high on at least one of the media competencies had increased academic achievement by an average of 20 percent and were not as vulnerable to cyberbullying (which the authors of the

A man was arrested by police for attacking a bus driver with a samurai sword after refusing to pay his fare - but was instead attacked himself by passengers.

The bus driver had just stopped at a traffic light in the German town of Mölln near Darmstadt, and the assailant boarded his bus and punched him in the face as a result.

The driver was knocked unconscious before passengers intervened and he was able to raise his hand to defend himself, German news outlet TZ reported.

The man eventually managed to get off the bus and run away, after which police were called, according to the report.

The driver was taken to hospital for treatment.

He was not the only bus driver injured this week.

The motorcyclist attacked another man in Munich with a sword Thursday; he received minor injuries.

A 22-year-old man, who was wearing a hoodie, is suspected of the assault, according to Bild.

Earlier the same morning, a man armed with a chainsaw assaulted a woman in Berlin .

The 44-year-old was reportedly suffering from mental health problems when he attacked the mother and daughter.

Police said the victim told them the suspect attacked him with the chainsaw for having a cigarette in an outdoor cafe area in the German city.<|endoftext|>A recent study found that more than a third (36.1 percent) of those who have undergone breast augmentation have experienced postoperative skin discoloration, particularly if they had the implants surgically removed. Discoloration can be caused by the skin bacteria, candida. Many people do not take adequate care of their skin prior to and after a procedure to prevent it from becoming too damaged. In some cases, the bacteria may not be detected until the skin has healed and the discoloration is obvious – the result of poor postoperative skin care.

A skin care system that takes full advantage of new technologies and the skin care industry's knowledge of the most effective techniques, techniques for maintaining healthy skin, and information on the prevention of postoperative discoloration may result in better cosmetic outcomes with fewer problems including healing and infection.<|endoftext|>The following page is a work in progress.

The goal of this page is to give people a better understanding of how prosthetic hands, limbs, and other body parts are constructed and manufactured. The process involves a great deal of engineering, and it requires a lot of care in construction and finishing. This page contains an overview of the steps in the process, followed by the actual construction process.

This page provides a general overview of how prosthetic hands, limbs, and other body parts are constructed and manufactured. This section should only be viewed as an overview, as each of the pages will delve more deeply into the steps involved in the making of a hand or any other object. For more information, please visit the pages for: prosthetic hands, prosthetic limbs.


For a more detailed overview of prosthetic construction, including several different types of prosthetic hands, please checkout prosthetic hand making. Also, a more in-depth review of using 3D printing for producing plastic prosthetics may be found in the prosthetic hand section of the 3D printing for prosthetics blog.

2. Materials for prosthetics

The most important issue in regards to the construction of a prosthetic hand is materials. For a prosthetic hand, it is important that the object is safe, strong, lightweight, and functional. This section will examine the material choices currently available.

A hand composed of metal materials is not as difficult to construct as one composed of wood or polymer because the material and shape can be more easily altered. This makes metal prostheses safer to wear, but they do not perform as well as wood.

The prostheses found in the video, for instance, used a polypropylene plastic material. Plastic prostheses tend to be lighter and more malleable than wood.

Metal prostheses, for the most part, are either

RICHMOND – More than three dozen Richmond residents gathered Tuesday for a public forum on gun safety, held in response to the tragic massacre of six Americans in Newtown, Conn.

The residents, from neighborhoods across Richmond, held signs and listened to speakers like Democratic state Sen. Richard "Dickie" Brown, who is pushing legislation that would allow people with concealed carry permits to use their guns to protect themselves and others.

Brown said that he wants to know if people in Newtown need specific training on how to use a gun so that they could have self-defense against criminals like the shooter who killed 20 first-grade students and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary on Friday.

"This is the most important day that I expect to be in this body since I've been elected to this seat," Brown said during one of a number of public forums.

Brown described another event that drew more than 200 people at the University of Richmond Monday to discuss why the government should be looking to improve gun safety.

Brown, a pastor who has said he considers himself a strong advocate of Second Amendment rights, said Monday's event at the university was part of what he considers "a new kind of civic engagement that includes a broader conversation about the role of guns in society" and "a dialogue that is rooted in facts."

Brown said that his legislation should have been introduced sooner but it was also important to bring the debate out into the open.

Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said there needs to be "a comprehensive evaluation in the state of Virginia to see what has happened here."

"A comprehensive evaluation may not include that we should look to repeal our Second Amendment," Surovell said. "Some will say that there is no alternative but to repeal the Second Amendment. And other will say, well, how do you go about doing that? But I don't think there is any reason as a society to make this leap."

The forum, hosted at the George Mason University Law Center, began with an event at the George Mason Community Center on College Green, where police and city officials held a brief news conference to offer condolences to families and friends of the victims and to urge everyone to make sure their loved ones have a plan in place, if they are left defenseless by someone breaking into their home or school.

The city's Public Health Advisory Council later spoke to a room of people who identified themselves as gun owners, including several who said they'd not used guns in crimes in the last year alone.

On Tuesday, the forum moved to the University of Richmond. Police officers guarded the gates, and a few attendees left after Brown began speaking.

After about 20 minutes, Brown was in the middle of his comments when a woman began heckling him.

The argument continued in the back of the conference room, as people from each side shouted over one another.

Eventually, a member of Brown's team stood and spoke to Brown to ensure he was aware of the woman's behavior. The man, who declined to be identified, also went on to say that anyone who had the right to bear arms and was worried about what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary could be an NRA member. The man later told the audience that the forum "wasn't about the NRA or gun rights or about gun control. This was about gun safety."

When the woman interrupted, the man explained he was part of a group that had called Brown.

"I was on his team. I had him on the phone and had his staff contact me and say that he did not support this forum," he said. Brown took the podium and apologized for the interruption.

"I just want to make sure you understand I don't condone this type of behavior," Brown said. "I'm sorry it got out the way that it did. … It's unacceptable. … If you do it, I'll make sure you go to jail."

"It's clear this has become a very public issue. It seems as though if you had an opinion about it, you'd be able to find people who disagreed with you. … I just want everyone to understand this is very difficult."

Brown said he felt as though an online petition he had organized and signed on behalf of the people from Sandy Hook Elementary passed 150,000 signatures. He said he was surprised by the turnout for the forum and he'd been told about the protest earlier in the day at the Law Center, which had been attended by about 50 people.

The first speaker was Mike Leibson. Leibson told the crowd that he has "a concealed-carry permit" but isn't necessarily an avid shooter. He said that most of his family and friends support gun rights, but in today's society "you can't carry a firearm outside your home and go into a dark mall with your family."

Leibson described the recent violence to which Newtown is a "perfect example," adding

The following was delivered by President Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a September 30 presidential meeting at the G20 Summit in Germany.

As I said, we had a very successful meeting. It's going to take place a number of ways. We have to have an agreement on that.

First, Russia must recognize that the actions of the United States in Ukraine and Syria, which had great negative consequences, have consequences for the rest of the world. They hurt Russia. We want to help Russia to recover, to rebuild its economy so that it can become an attractive place for investments.

The second point was a great question. This is not a matter of being tough or being smart, as you know. This is a matter of what's good for Russia.

Russia and the United States are the only two nuclear countries. It's important to understand this and to really understand. The United States has significantly reduced its strategic nuclear arsenal over the last couple of decades from about 1,700 warheads to 1,000. I think that's a very big deal. We're reducing our nuclear arsenal, but not because of any threat. We're doing it—I think it's in our interest to do it. I think not for the reasons you might think. That's the way our country is. We are responsible—

QUESTION: So there won't be a war?

TRUMP: We're not talking about a war. We're not talking about World War III, believe me. Look, we're not talking about—we're talking about the reductions. We're going to be talking about some serious questions. And they have to do with the modernization of our nuclear arsenal. So let's hope that over the next period of time Russia and the United States can sit down together when it comes to nuclear issues.

QUESTION: Was that a one on one meeting?

TRUMP: It was a follow up.

QUESTION: A follow up to what?

TRUMP: It was a follow up to a very good meeting. It's going to take place. You're going to know when it's on.

The third thing is I'm sure I'll be asked about Syria, but I think that this was one of the most successful meetings I've ever had, more than any other meeting I've had, at least with respect to all of the subjects you're talking about, that I can recall. But Syria is obviously a difficult situation. But Syria is not the only one when you look at North Korea. We're not talking about war. We're not talking about nuclear war. This was a very, very productive meeting, and I'm sure we're going to do—now I have to run, because it was such a successful meeting, we're going to do many other things. But we're going to have many other meetings. So be sure we are in the right state.

All right, with that, we have—

Now it is true I spoke with Vladimir Putin twice yesterday.

HOLT: All right. But let me just follow up with you, Mr. President. Your press secretary said that you would come into the G20 and have a productive conversation with your Russian counterpart, but what did you actually talk about? Did you get to the subject of—or did the subject of sanctions—which the United States has imposed on the Russian financial system—were you able to work out some sort of a truce, a cease-fire, in terms of Syria? That would seem to be an issue that was—so that we do not start World War III.

And, of course, you would never speak about that on the plane.

TRUMP: Well, we did speak about the whole thing with Syria, and it was an amicable conversation. I can't believe it's two days since I spoke to him. I can't believe it. I was so happy I got to speak to him, and I got to be around him. It was an amazing day.

I think we are in very good shape. We believe we are going to have very good chemistry. I think probably we will, as I said, in two weeks, go for the second summit, and I think we will have a very good chemistry, which, you know, we haven't had. There was obviously great chemistry between this gentleman and Secretary Clinton. We did have some very good chemistry when we met in Moscow a couple of months ago. I think that's going to happen again, and I think the world is looking to us and hopefully they will be looking to us—if we do what we should be doing—and we do that, we will have great relations and it'll be a good thing for Russia, and it'll be a good thing for the world, because Russia will be a respected country again.

Anxiety can affect the same parts of the brain responsible for the feeling of fear, but in a different order, according to a Canadian study published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. The findings could help identify individuals at highest risk of developing generalized anxiety and related problems, such as PTSD or anxiety disorders, the researchers said.

"We looked at the functional anatomy of the anterior cingulate cortex, an area that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders because of its involvement in fear. We wanted to know if anxiety was modulated differently depending on the context of fear versus alertness, and if different areas of the body impacted the order that anxiety and alertness came under control," said author Dr. Michael J. Fenton, lead author of the study and research fellow in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at McGill University.

The researchers found a direct relation between anxiety and the strength of connections in the brain's anterior cingulate cortex. The greater the strength of the neuronal responses to fear, the more "anxious" the person, which in turn, led to a less-restful state in the anterior cingulate. A decrease in these responses resulted in less-anxious people, according to the study.

"In summary, when the brain has to choose between 'fearlessness' and 'anxiousness', it makes a more favourable choice," Fenton explained. "But when we consider the different ways in which a person perceives a potential threat, this choice can still be difficult."

For example, the anterior cingulate cortex may respond more strongly to non-threatening events, such as being a stranger who is speaking to you, as compared to fearful ones, such as a person speaking to you and making eye contact.

Fenton and his co-authors, including Dr. D. K. Datta from the Centre for Functional MRI, and Dr. Andrew D. Pashler of The University of Western Ontario, looked at the functional anatomy of the anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. They also examined their results in a group of typically anxious or low-anxious individuals.

"What had us concerned was the pattern of neural responses in the ACC that came after a person experienced the fearful or anogenital threat. We knew that the anterior cingulate cortex responded to anxiety differently depending on the sensory environment of the threat."

The results showed that while the ACC response depended on how the person perceived fear, the ACC responses came under the direct control of the brain's motor control centres. This was in contrast to when a person was aware that they had a problem.

"This provides the evidence that the activation of sensory pathways could be influenced by the level of self-awareness," said Fenton. "By understanding the role of sensory systems in the neural control of anxiety, we may now be able to identify people who are more prone to developing anxiety disorders because of the way that they perceive the world."

The authors said this could be useful in identifying individuals at highest risk. While studies of anxiety disorders that involve the use of brain-imaging technology do not currently exist, Dr. Datta said, future studies using fMRI and other imaging technology could provide new insights as to what is going on inside the brain of people at risk.

Other co-authors of the study are Drs. David J. Pashler and David M. Rutter, from the Centre for Functional MRI, and Dr. Andrew Rutter from the University of Western Ontario.<|endoftext|>As soon as Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks publicly about his firm's ongoing battles in China, the reaction in the mainland often follows suit.

The U.S. company has been in the spotlight lately after a lawsuit was filed by a New York patent holder in the Eastern District of New York alleging that Apple infringed on three patents at least as far back as 2006. The three patents were related to the way that Apple handles iTunes software updates to its products, including iPod downloads, iTunes purchases, and Apple Pay online purchases.Apple has denied the allegations and, in a blog post, said that it doesn't license or sell "mobile operating system software" to other companies. Apple's own legal team is representing it at this point and is looking for a compromise, but there would have to be approval of the lawsuit from the judge.Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world and one of the most valuable, which allows Apple to play hardball when it comes to China. When Cook visited the country last week , Apple gave a number of interviews, including one in which Cook said that Apple is "confident" that China can handle its business but that the government has to do more to allow Apple to expand

LAWHU, Yemen — As the government of Yemen's embattled president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, tries to bring its military operation in neighboring Houthi-controlled northern Yemen to a halt, it has also opened a major new front: southern Yemen.


Since fighting escalated in late May, Yemen's newly formed, Saudi-led coalition has been pounding Houthi positions on dozens of frontlines in the rugged southern corner of Yemen, including Taiz, Marib, Saada and the province of Hadramawt.


The onslaught is aimed in part at bringing down Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al Houthi, and also to bolster Hadi's embattled army. But the government of President Hadi, which once enjoyed a reputation for unity and stability, appears divided between its supporters, who are fighting in the south, and its enemies, who are fighting in the east.


The growing rift underlines the precarious situation in the country, which has witnessed an array of rival factions in Yemen for more than 20 years.

"The political division is very big; I'm sure you can imagine," said a Yemeni observer in Sanaa, who has close ties to Hadi but is currently based in neighboring Oman.

'We're not fighting each other'

For now, the Saudi-led coalition, which comprises Arab states, is fighting alongside Sunni tribesmen, including the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, to retake Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, from militants loyal to the former president.

The Yemenis are not fighting with each other. At the top, there's Ali Abdullah Saleh, we're not killing each other, there's no difference

"The Yemeni people have never supported any one party over the other," Hadi's chief advisor, Abdulrazzaq al Zaidi, told the local Al Jazeera news channel. "We are fighting the Houthis, and there's no war taking place between Yemenis and Saudis."

Zaidi said the coalition was determined to defeat the Houthis.


"The Yemeni people are the most affected by the Yemen-Saudi confrontation," he said. "The Yemenis are not fighting with each other. At the top, there's Ali Abdullah Saleh, we're not killing each other, there's no difference."

It is unclear exactly how many casualties have been inflicted on Saudi Arabia's coalition, who have been supported by the international community. But there are growing fears over the Saudi-led coalition's ability to deliver on its promise to stamp out the Houthis, who have taken control of much of the north and east of Yemen, and have threatened to move on the capital.

Saudi Arabia and its allies have so far been unable to recapture Sanaa, a prize they lost to forces loyal to Hadi's government in early 2015.

While the battle for Sanaa has claimed hundreds of lives, Hadi has not had an easy hand in negotiating a cessation of hostilities and peace terms.


"Houthis are the new enemy in Aden, and it's a battle between two different people's armies, but the Houthis have made a peace deal with Hadi," said Abdulla Farag, a retired Yemeni official. "Hadi has the advantage in Aden because people understand that the Houthis and Saleh have no interest in the city," he said.

But Houthi-held Yemeni ports and airports are now largely closed.


The coalition's recent military campaign in Marib, a strategically important port city on the Red Sea, has been met with a series of bombings targeting Houthi fighters.

'Houthis would prefer to see Yemen break apart'

"After Marib, the coalition is on the edge of becoming engaged in the war," said a Yemeni government official.

In Hadramawt province, where most of the fighting has been raging, Hadi is pushing for reconciliation with the northern tribes.

Meanwhile, forces loyal to Saleh have taken several fronts in the south.


A Saudi-led coalition was supposed to have entered Taiz and its adjacent province of Hadramawt from Oman in late May, but after fierce fighting, the effort remains stuck. Houthi forces have also made gains in the southern cities of Marib, al Hudaydah and Aden – all of which fell to Hadi's loyalists in late 2015. "Houthis would prefer to see Yemen break apart," said a Yemeni government source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Saleh is a stubborn politician with a well-documented history of warring against the Yemeni government. He is also a close ally of Iran, which has dispatched its own military advisers and troops to Yemen as the conflict has intensified.

Meanwhile, Houthi forces – backed by Saleh militias – have been making gains in Aden,

Taken as a whole, the new data suggest that the country's unemployment could be heading off a cliff. But while that may sound ominous, there isn't anything necessarily scary about falling short of full employment.

A measure like this, called U-6 -- which counts unemployed adults who are unemployed and who have given up and not looked for jobs in the last four weeks, but still want work -- has been a reliable measure of labor-market slack for years.

And its latest, revised version, still shows an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, not the 4.5 percent it first reported Friday and not the 4.9 percent we are hoping for.

"There is no obvious cause for concern," Mr. Summers said.

If anything, the new data suggested that the underlying trend in labor-market slack has slowed. The percentage of adults between 20 and 54 who don't have full-time or equivalent jobs reached its highest level since 1999 shortly after the recession, but is now back to levels from before 2007 even though the population overall is also growing.

And that means the trend is starting to reverse. In 2000, more than three out of four working-age adults were employed full time, with nearly all working at minimum wage. But in 2010 -- four years after the start of the Great Recession -- just over three-quarters of working-age adults were employed full time.

The job market is "still in need of reform," Mr. Summers said, but in a way that is more inclusive than other recent efforts to boost the job market. The Obama administration's new rules for overtime pay, for example, offer fewer and lower-paying jobs than many expected, while giving larger and higher-paying ones a much larger head start.

But the broader problem of low productivity growth has kept workers from getting more money they need to cover their costs. Even though the unemployment rate would seem to argue for higher productivity growth -- which we think would help create a stronger labor market -- there are many other reasons to doubt there will be more job growth over the coming year.<|endoftext|>LONDON: In February 2012, British photographer Pauline Wright was in a hospital in India on a medical leave to care for her mother.The British photographer was just returning home from the hospital when she came across a woman in pain lying on the road.Wright decided to take a closer look.While trying to take a good picture, Wright's hand was suddenly gripped by a woman at an astonishing 45 degrees.The force and impact hurled the photographer about 15 feet. She ended up lying on the road with her leg broken.The incident left Wright shaken and traumatized. For years, Wright kept her experience a secret, fearing it had marked her as a 'bio-warrior'. But as she started working more seriously on her documentary film about the effects of stress on the body and mind, she said her life had dramatically changed."The first day I was out there, I came across an old woman who had lost a leg – that's when I felt I had a role to play," Wright told AFP at the British film industry's annual awards ceremony in London and a film festival. "There is no going back when a limb is involved."While the incident is widely known in Britain and Wright's story is featured in the movie, Wright refused to publish photographs of the encounter in her memoir."It's probably one of the few photos I have not been too brave to let go of," she said about her photograph taken in the street.The photos of Wright and the older woman in the street went viral online and gained her an international following. A number of publications in Britain made the image the cover for their books, which helped create international awareness about the issue of women's health.Wright had become the world's most famous woman photographer after taking over as the official photographer of the 2012 London Olympics and then the 2013 World Athletics Championships."It's hard to put a value on what it's done for me," she said. "I have changed from a man into a woman with that moment in the street."Wright also says she is more focused on her work. She has never used body doubles or fake injuries. She has even stopped wearing high heels or tight clothes to take pictures of athletes."I've realized the biggest challenge is working without a camera in front of me because I feel I am too close to it," she said.<|endoftext|>Tiny Tiny Log

BARRIE, Ore. – There is no shortage of things that have to be done between now and June 1 to ensure the continued smooth transition of the Oregon State women's basketball team into its new home, the new Thomas & Mack Center.

After all, this isn't a program without a new house or an established rivalry.

After years of building their foundations in Pullman, many who've worked closely with the Beavers over the years have come to be known as "team players." There are those who come to terms with their positions in the program, but they are few and far between.

There is the coach herself, Carla Gee. She will be the face of the new building once the final work is done. The first woman to ever coach in the NCAA Tournament, Gee was brought in to help the program prepare for what had been considered a long-shot at keeping the program moving forward at its home.

As a former assistant coach for the University of Washington and the San Francisco Dons, Gee was asked to help lead the program with the arrival of Gee Field House. She will be assisted by Chris Klenovsky, who had a successful tenure as head coach at Portland State in the mid 2000s. He is also a native of Portland and would likely have the most of a connection with the fans.

There is also the state's best-known sports agent, Jay Kornegay, whose client list includes Kelly Olynyk, the woman who became the fourth overall pick in the 2015 Women's NBA Draft. Kornegay is another player who will be a part of the new team and who will be closely tied to Gee as both are represented by Kornegay.

However, as important as these people and more to the success of the team are, they are merely a part of it. They are the foundation upon which the team is built.

"They're all so important," said Gee, "but they are so individual. They're not pieces of the puzzle that make the whole. It is us as players that have to get together. It is us as a group, our community, as our boosters, as people who all want to be part of the journey."

To ensure all of this will happen quickly, Gee has already begun a task force of more than 20 people to help get ready for the changes. This task force has already put in place the infrastructure for the new building. While it may have a few months to wait for completion, it does not need to wait.

"This isn't a small project," she said. "We can move in quickly. That's why I'm calling this a transition task force. It's all about getting together and getting things together. We're going through that in the next few weeks."

Gee has a clear vision for what the building should look like. She is well aware of how it will affect the fan base. The new arena will include four 40-foot wide luxury suites, one of which will be dedicated solely to Gee. It will feature a private bar, a lounge, and a large room to host a variety of events. If you haven't been to the new arena with Gee, you will notice that she has the luxury of having the players' lounge and the coaches' locker room available to her on game nights. She doesn't want those things to be shared.

"I think the best suites are only as good as the people who live there," she said. "They do the best they can, and we're going to do the best we can to match this with the area that we'll have to work with. I'm hoping to have the luxury to be able to spend my entire summer there. If I think I can do it, I'm going to do it.

"As far as the new building, it needs to be something that stands the test of time. It needs to be something people are proud of and that we can really put our stamp on it and tell the world what we have accomplished here. When you build something, people want to be a part of it."

It is clear from Gee's tone that the new center must be a place where all students, alumni and fans can walk through the front door and see what her team has accomplished.

"We always talk about community, about the support they have," she said. "What people want to do is be a part of the process, and that is what I am trying to create in my mind for the community. I'm trying to build a support network now for this community of students. I think this new building will help the students of Oregon State really take off and do as well as possible on the court."

There will be many people who live or work in Bend who have no idea what the Oregon State women's basketball team has accomplished in the last two years. Gee intends to change that
======================================== SAMPLE 57 ========================================
The Washington Wizards have a very deep and talented bench. But John Wall and Bradley Beal have had a very, very difficult time getting enough shots going.

It's a topic worth discussing. But it's a topic that should not be the main focus for the game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night.

The Wizards' bench has struggled to get any production the past two games. Wall is averaging 13.3 points and shooting 42 percent after totaling 33 points, 10 assists and only five turnovers in six of his previous five games. Beal is averaging 10.9 points and shooting 28.0 percent on 3-pointers after totaling 18 points, seven assists and two steals in his previous eight games.

It's a huge drop-off for the second year guard after he averaged 19.8 points and 43.3 percent from 3-point range in his first season with the Wizards. Wall and Beal were supposed to get out of their slump.

But that's not the issue, at least not right now.

Wall doesn't need to be shooting better in order to help his teams win. He is playing like he is back to full health and ready to go on Monday. Beal and the Wizards need to get more involved around him so the defense is a little more cohesive on defense.

Wall has done a pretty good job managing his team as far as offense goes, but the bench has been unable to pick up the slack.

The Wizards have had a handful of players score in double digits, but they have struggled to do so consistently.

John Wall had 10 assists and 15 points in 22.5 minutes Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.

Otto Porter had 12 points and five assists Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.

Bradley Beal had nine points and four assists Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.

It's not just one or two issues, there's a whole lot of issues playing so few minutes a game or getting fewer shots when they are called up.

But the Wizards need to try to find a way to win without Wall. He played a career-high 46 minutes and finished with 14 points and 10 assists in a win over the Denver Nuggets last Sunday, but he and the team didn't score until late in the second quarter and the Wizards fell behind by 13 points in the quarter.

John Wall has played 36 minutes in each of Washington's past three games and hasn't scored in double figures. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) More

Wall was averaging 23.3 points and 9.9 assists before Monday's game.

There has been a lot of talk about how the Wizards are relying on Wall more in order to get to the playoffs for just the second time since 2007 and the first time since 2004-05. The issue is, he is not playing as hard and with as much intensity as he has the past two games.

When Wall wasn't on the court, the point guards and big men did a much better job of defending the Warriors. The bench has had several issues throughout this series.

The Wizards need Wall to be active and contribute so they can win. It sounds like Wall does that in spurts sometimes, but the lineup doesn't seem to have a plan for it. It's not a bad approach. But the Wizards are making the wrong moves.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

I got this as a gift but never put it to the test. It's like I never tried it. The texture is amazing and the smell really invokes a nice smell of vanilla. I have yet to experience any ill side effects such as any bad after-taste like many people complain about in reviews. The only issue is I cannot see what I'm doing wrong to get the same results. I get the same effect every time when I mix this. What would make the experience better would be more consistent between different batches. That's all I've got.

Since my departure, the state of the country seemed as if it were doomed to collapse. The Republican Party ran a president who, after being elected to office, repeatedly demonstrated his personal disinterest with the duties that come with being president. America had a President who repeatedly refused to recognize the legitimacy of the 2016 election and the resulting popular vote; he refused to release his tax returns; he refused to defend the U.S. Constitution as the Constitution originally meant or the First Amendment as the Bill of Rights used to apply; he refused to publicly address the racial divide in this country; and he refused to recognize the importance of religious freedom. All while the Republican Party and the country as a whole appeared to be divided along ethno-cultural lines, the most obvious examples being those visible on a daily basis at various football games. The nation was also consumed by a massive financial crisis, which left many Americans searching for answers as to how they could move forward; many, of course, were able to find answers. For me, these answers took me to China, to China on the other side of the planet. But I can't say the same for the Chinese government.


As the United States celebrates its bicentennial, a country that I once called home, and as the country prepares for this year's presidential election, one would think that Americans would be reflecting on how to move on. The fact of the matter is, they've moved on before. They've moved over and over again.

When I was 14, while living in the U.S., I decided to move to Japan with my mother, brother, and father. After living with my mother every night, one week at a time, I got used to being there at 9 p.m. I didn't miss anything — certainly not the country — it was just a new place to live every week. What I didn't miss was a time before America, or a time before America had become America. I didn't miss the same, predictable American reality or cultural norms.

I didn't miss that, back then, America wasn't a country for foreigners, and that the culture was different, with a different history, and that its current leaders were largely responsible for this difference.

And yet — as the country we call America prepares to elect a woman as its first female president, and in 2016 as many as 25 of our largest cities saw a record population increase in the African-American community – not least of which is a welcome development – it is important to recognize that the nation's culture is now one that embraces many foreign perspectives. I had only learned about America from television, from watching movies and seeing shows about celebrities and politicians. It wasn't until I traveled to China that I experienced America firsthand. And after watching the shows about celebrities and politicians I returned to America expecting the same. The reality is quite different.

I spent a year in Shanghai, learning about Chinese life, the political institutions, and the history of the country. I traveled to the Gobi Desert, one of the world's largest deserts, and learned about the extreme climate and the challenges in managing one hundred million people and a country built upon sand dunes. I traveled deep into the mountains, with the view that China may, for a time, be inching towards an oil shortage, and felt the pressure and the pressure of environmental preservation. And the experiences and ideas with which I was immersed did little to change my opinion on our current president.

I can say one thing for certain about President Trump from that time, though. What we are witnessing now is that what was once "normal" has become "unusual." In the past, President Trump was simply an ordinary politician who ran as an underdog and who was not well known. The fact that he still has a base of support in his party makes it less improbable that he could, at some point, win the presidency – it's actually not unlikely that he will someday.

Trump may never win the presidency, not until he proves to be a true president who can actually help people in this country — but the fact

It didn't quite sink in until this morning when I was going to bed and the thought popped into my head. What the hell am I doing? I've had to write this on every single Wednesday, now I'm posting it every week.

Last week I went to a party I didn't go to, called a girl I barely talked to and slept with my best friend. That wasn't enough fun, so I started over on Wednesday. That still wasn't enough fun, so I went to a party on the third and last Wednesday. That was more fun, and I ended up with someone I can't believe we made it through that.

The idea of all this was so incredibly exciting, and I knew it wouldn't stop the day after or the week after. I was also pretty tired and sleepy so I tried to stay up pretty late. That was a mistake too, so I slept in. Now, I've only been out three times since I started last year, but I've also only gone out in the mornings, so I figured there must be something wrong with me. Well I was wrong about me, even though I went to parties. I think that was how I found love.

I didn't want to sleep on Wednesday after all the fun so I decided that I'd make another night of it. That proved to be a mistake too, it was still early and the sun was coming up, but I didn't realize it until the sun was up like, hours ago. So I went to the bathroom and looked up how long it takes to find love. I was pretty shocked when I saw it was about an hour a day, so I didn't take it seriously. I just went back to sleep.

The next day I went to a party, got wasted at the bar, and got up drunk again (I'm starting to learn this is harder than I thought). When I came home I got even worse and ended up sleeping with some dude on the porch, which was even worse because that was the best party I ever went to!

That was pretty much it for the next few days. There was the one night when I stayed up until 4 AM to try and win another girl. And there was the night I got drunk for the first time and had sex with one of my best friends. When I was done there was no way I could ever want to go back to anything more than that. I never want to leave.

And why is that? Well, I guess for now I've got my own issues, but eventually I'll get past them. So when I'm a grownup, I'm not going to be looking for romance on a daily basis. It's weird because I kind of feel like I need to because I need to feel alive. I know that sounds selfishly selfish, but I have to have other people in my life. I need to know I'm not losing them. And what if I don't find them? I lose them. I'll lose you.

In a surprise move, Turkey inked a deal with Iran on Saturday for a 3 billion euro gas deal.


Turkey, the country that provides a fifth of the world's gas needs, has agreed to open a new offshore gas field, on the coast of Iran, in a deal hammered out between the two countries.


Speaking at gas conference in Istanbul on Saturday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the deal will open up new areas to development.


The agreement, which will create several fields for the developing countries, comes as the Turkish company ONGT, an Iranian state-owned energy company, has started work on building two additional fields as part of an agreement signed in June 2012.


The field on the Iranian coast was located off Iran's western coast and became operational in April 2013, providing new supplies to Turkey, Iran's southern neighbor.


Speaking to journalists in Istanbul, Erdogan said the fields "represent a new development in the Iranian gas market," and will help to diversify the country's energy supplies as well as provide more economic benefits.


He also said that Turkish state gas company TRT could potentially earn "millions" in extra profits from the deals due to the oil price fall.


Iranian Oil minister Bijan Zangeneh also expressed hope that a deal would be reached between the two countries to boost Turkey's energy supplies and increase market share in the region.


Turkey supplies two-thirds of the gas used in the European Union and Middle East, and as a major provider to Asia.


Zangeneh said "there are no other significant suppliers" in the region, adding that the gas field was expected to start operating by the end of next year or beginning of next year.


In the first such deal involving an Iranian company, Russia's Gazprom inked a deal in 2009 with China's CNPC to develop Iran's huge Arak gas field.

Last Update: Sunday, 25 January 2015 KSA 11:57 - GMT 08:57<|endoftext|>The United Nations Human Rights Council has voted in favor of a "consensus statement" calling on the government in Pakistan to stop "brutal executions" against religious minorities, including Shi'ites, and to protect religious minority places of worship and schools. Pakistan is the only Muslim-majority country not to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and a number of other human rights treaties that bar extrajudicial killing.

The draft statement, obtained by The Intercept, is signed by all members of the 47-nation Human Rights Council except China, which is the special representative of the UN to Pakistan, and Cuba, which withdrew its signature on the text. India, which initially said it would sign the statement, dropped its signature after it was revealed that Pakistan sent a letter to India's foreign ministry warning of consequences if India did not sign the document. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also threatened to bring an international human rights complaint against India if it didn't sign. Pakistan has already been under UN pressure to put an end to the extrajudicial killings and executions of suspected militants or security personnel by the country's intelligence agencies.

But the timing of the international coalition's response is curious. Earlier this month, a Pakistani court sentenced to death a former Pakistani Taliban commander for his parts in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and last week, Pakistan executed three people convicted of terrorism-related crimes. The Pakistan government has come under fire for its treatment of religious minorities in the country. During 2014, Pakistan executed 25 Shi'ites and other groups that included Hindus including Dalits. In February and March, more than 1,200 people were killed by a Pakistani Taliban splinter group called Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In June, Pakistan hanged 18 men for the 2005 serial bombings in Mumbai — the biggest anti-terrorism act in the country's history at the time, causing more than 160,000 deaths in India over 12 days.

The "consensus statement" was drafted by the UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Pakistan, David Kaye, who had been investigating the killings and executions. In addition to the UN, the statement was also supported by the European Council for Fatwa and Research, the Council of Europe (which includes some Muslim countries), and the Council of Muslim Organizations in Europe. The United States, Pakistan's ally and a leading donor, did not sign the statement, and the United Kingdom took no part in the debate. But, according to the New York Times, several of the countries that signed the statement are U.S. allies.

"This is a historic development in the struggle to protect minority rights in Pakistan. The government has pledged its full support of the statement. We must now do the same in the United States and globally, and we must do so immediately," Kaye said in a statement.

This week Pakistan also signed an

The new book What Can We Learn From the Fall of the Roman Empire? describes a new view of Rome's fall that sees a more prosaic, less exciting approach.


This book is an attempt to restore Rome's historical stature.


While Rome itself was at its height, its empire was in decline. The Romans could no longer carry out the task of protecting the peoples who lived across their borders, and their empire was increasingly being threatened by barbarian invasions.


This new approach sees Rome's fall in terms of four stages:


First, Rome as a military power collapsed under internal instability. By the time of the emperor Nero, the Roman army was being disbanded as legions were being lost to the barbarian invasions.


Second, internal crisis in Rome's society undermined Rome's political leaders and weakened Rome's army. The emperors Nero, Caligula, and Vitellius were no longer trusted by the people, and soon, all three were removed from office.


Third, once internal anarchy spread to the empire's politics, the military leaders that came afterwards were unable to protect Rome against the barbarian invasions of the East.


Fourth, the fall of Rome as a military power was a sign that the Roman city itself was failing as it was not built to be capable of controlling large populations. The decline of Rome as a military power meant that by the time of the death of Augustus, the Roman Empire was no longer able to control its vast borders.


For this reason, the study of the fall of Rome has become the subject of a variety of theories. The author examines two key theories.


The first is the Classical theory (known as the 'conquest' theory), which sees the collapse of the empire in its last days as a consequence of a civil war between Rome's two 'brides'.


Contemporary commentators have often confused this theory in their scholarship. The second theory is the 'persecuting' theory, which sees the decline of Rome as the work of the Roman Senate, which had become more autocratic than ever under the fall of Emperor Tiberius.


The author shows that both 'conquest' and 'persecuting' theories can be useful if one accepts that the empire's fall occurred because of two competing political processes within the empire.


The book concludes by analysing the effects these two processes had on Rome. The author argues that the rise of the Senate under Nero was an essential ingredient to Rome's recovery.<|endoftext|>ROBERT WOLFE'S new book tells the story of an extraordinary journey to find God and why the Christian faith has survived, he says.

By Robert Wolff


The Book of Mormon (Book of Mormon Foundation/AP)

What did Robert Wolff do to survive?

A devout atheist and writer of popular science books, he started his own magazine, The Scientific Atheist, and in 1997 published A Brief History of Time. This best-seller argued that the Earth is not only old and did not originate from a singular point in time but is actually the result of innumerable past collisions between atoms and space-time. This was seen as a bold statement, provoking fierce debate. It earned a rebuke from the Christian scientific community, which did not consider atheists' claims in any sense "theistic," but rather "agnostic," and in some quarters even more controversial.

To this day Wolff says the debate he provoked has not subsided. "The world has changed more in the last 10 years than in the previous 500," he says. "We now have a generation whose whole notion of the world being created by God has just exploded in their face," Wolff says.

There are now millions of people who have not only rejected the Christian faith but also "have very strong feelings of skepticism on many other points of science," he says. "Even as recently as 20 years ago, if someone brought up a scientific issue, they were supposed to say, 'Well, it's not settled.' But today it's absolutely clear, the evidence is conclusive."

Wolff points to Darwin: The Origin of Species, now in its third printing, with an introduction to explain the controversy surrounding Darwin's theory, as among the most influential science books of the 20th century. Published in 1871, it has sold 250,000 copies, Wolff says. "It was a book that had to be defended as if it mattered."

A Brief History of Time (Robert Wolff and Robert A. Freitas Jr., 2007)

Wolff recently published What is God? (Random House, 2014). He argues that Christianity's survival is due less to intellectual prowess than a cultural phenomenon. "It's not due to some secret knowledge or something God knew. It's because Christianity is part of a very powerful and successful and broad coalition in the world right now," Wolff says. "It was about being good, being moral, being ethical.

"Do you know of a place of refuge?"

"Yes sir, but they're not friendly."

"Where is that?"

The man's eyes twinkled with a knowing glint as he began a story. "That's where I come in. I'm a man of the night and I can keep you safe in a fight."

"A place of refuge?" I said, and for the first time since I saw my father that night, his eyes were sad.

"That's where I come in. The night is mine."

To that, I shrugged my shoulders. He's a man I trust in his word.

I waited.

"A young man once went into the desert to visit a strange lady. They never came back, but it was a beautiful night. The sky was so blue that one could have looked a hundred miles across. As they rode off into the night, they made for a cave at the edge of the cliff. When they were ready to rest, a strange beast approached, but before it could catch up to them, the strange lady jumped out, screaming,"

"So, do you know where that cave is?" I asked, now knowing his story, and he nodded. "So you're a ghost?"

"No," he said. "Not a ghost. Not anyone in the world."

I nodded.

"The only warning I ever had, when I was a little boy, was a strange wind coming behind me. I was in my room at night, sleeping, and the wind kept blowing. It woke me, but I didn't see anything. It blew all night. It kept waking me, and I remember hearing that terrible, frightening sound."

I nodded. Then, looking to a corner of the roof, I thought for a moment. "That's it…"

And so you see. I've come to do good. I've come because I've forgotten the man I used to be. Because the man who helped me to remember was in him. Because now he's not there, he's not around.

So, I am out of my room. The door is locked. No one could get to me if he wanted to. I am out of my mind. The lights are on and there are people walking about.

I take off and look around. I'm in the middle of a city. The city is silent. I can hear all kinds of noises outside. Cars. Cars. Cars. Birds. Cars. Cars. Cars. Cars. Cars. Cars are driving everywhere. All around me. I look. Someone is coming with a lantern. I listen. But all I can hear is the sound of people breathing, breathing. Breathing.

"Why don't you turn around?" a young man calls out.

I don't get a turn, so I turn around. As soon as I turn around, a girl starts approaching me at walking speed. I stare at her. She's stunning. She doesn't look frightened at all. And she's saying something to me and I can't make out what she's saying.

She doesn't look scared, and she doesn't look frightened at me. So I look at her. She is wearing a black jumpsuit with red flowers on it. Her shirt and pants are white but their pockets are red. Red roses.

I stop and look at the girl.

"You're a ghost?" she asks.

"No," I tell her, as loud as I can. "It's only because you're wearing that jumpsuit."

"You're a ghost." She says. "You'll never leave this place where you came from. You can't. I'll go with you. And when I make my way back, you won't be able to remember what happened in here." She says.

It's a lie. Even if she were a ghost, if she is a real girl with real feelings, she would still be haunted by the last twenty-four hours. And I've never been truly in love, so…

"But I'm a ghost!"

I turn around again. "I know. I remember this. I'm a ghost…"

She doesn't notice a thing.

"But I'll be back."

I turn into a alley and start to walk as fast as I can. I keep staring at her.

She's gone. No one can hear me anymore.

I open a door and walk in the street. I turn around. They're gone. Nothing.

And I can't move.

That's the way it is. I can't go anywhere. There's nothing here but…nothing except me and…this place.

I stare.

Maybe I don't want to remember that. Maybe it's like it

A former Marine and father of two is now in custody after police say a man accidentally shot himself when he found a concealed firearm in his car.

The incident occurred at approximately 3:30 a.m. Saturday in the 2900 block of West Irving Park Road (map).

Police responded to the first report of a gunshot and found a victim sitting in his car. Police believe the victim found a weapon in the backseat of the car and mistakenly used it to shoot himself.

The victim was immediately transported to a local hospital, where he continues to recover.

The vehicle is believed to have been parked at the corner of Irving and Chicago (map), when the accident occurred.

According to charging documents, the victim is a current Marine stationed in South Korea. He has a valid concealed carry permit issued in April 2014, but the firearm was removed from his vehicle last May.

The man told police he never removed the firearm from his vehicle as the gun belonged to someone else (and he was not the owner of any firearms), so it is still considered a "lawful firearm," police said.

The man had purchased the gun legally before it left his name, and he has not been charged.

A woman and a young child were in the car during the accident. No charges have been filed in this case.

The man remains in custody.

Police have not released his identity.

Dianne Meehan, 45, and her daughter, Tiffany (C), are seen in an undated family photo obtained by Reuters that was provided to Reuters by her attorney David S. Schore. REUTERS/David S. Schore/FILE PHOTO

Dianne Meehan, 45, of Winchester, Virginia, admitted poisoning Tiffany Meehan, 7, in March with toxic levels of loperamide, an antihistamine, the criminal complaint said

The indictment in Winchester District Court, Virginia said the girl's grandmother had given the poisoned foods because Meehan's husband, Jason, had "refused to purchase (toxic) medication which would clear her of suspicion," according to the complaint.

Meehan and her husband had separated over custody of the girl but remained legally married. Her husband was on death row for killing a neighbor in 2004.

Meehan has been in custody since March after the death of her daughter prompted her to claim that some of the poisonings were accidental and not intentional.

Loperamide, like the antihistamine Benadryl, is used to treat allergic reactions. Poisoning is the use of harmful substances used without the user's knowledge and can be deadly.

Loperamide can also cause life-threatening liver toxicity.

Loperamide is also available as part of over-the-counter allergy remedies and can be bought on the Internet on websites such as Amazon and Target.com.

The federal Food and Drug Administration does not recognize loperamide as a controlled substance, nor does it require manufacturers to submit a notice to the FDA when marketing it.

In a plea agreement signed on Tuesday, Meehan will face sentencing in November. She was free on $1.5 million bond in the case because there is a gag order on her case, the Commonwealth's Attorney's office said.<|endoftext|>The man who killed an intruder inside his West Hollywood home shot the intruder once, according to police.The shooting happened about 7 a.m. Wednesday inside a home in the 6100 block of West Highland Avenue, Los Angeles police said.

I like to think of myself as being rather socially-aware, but I know that is no more true than saying I have good taste when looking at art.

I've been looking at the work of one artist in particular lately because I have a hard time distinguishing myself from him.

His work is beautiful, but his name is a bit more unexpected than I would have initially anticipated.

When I started to see his work, I had no idea whom he worked for.

The only thing I knew was that it was an agency that specialized in marketing their artists.

Then I got to look at the photos he released of his work and I was absolutely astounded by them.

No joke, they are breathtaking.

So stunning that when I first saw some of the work he posted on Facebook, I thought the pictures were photoshopped.

I can't claim to have art knowledge as such, but I was under the impression that artists who were using Photoshop would have much more subtle, stylized work.

No, this wasn't the case.

Here's a bit from his most recent Facebook post

He used Photoshop to replicate a variety of elements in an incredibly detailed fashion.

You can barely tell the difference between these two images.

I just couldn't believe it, considering so much detail had been put into these photos.

I didn't expect such a level of detail.

I couldn't help but be incredibly impressed by his ability to bring color and depth to a still image before it was posted, and before it had even been captured.

Here are a few screenshots of his work to show more of his work:

It's been quite interesting to look at.

The artist who created this incredible work was very open about his work and gave us all an inside look at the work he had created.

But this wasn't a one-off either.

Here's a few screenshots from the artist's other Facebook posts:

I think I can safely say this is one of the most open-ended pieces of art I have seen recently.

This level of creativity and creativity is not often seen in the world of art in general.

We get the most popular artists, the famous, recognizable, and famous artists, and the really good artists who make work with the same level of subtlety.

The guy who created these photos obviously put a lot into them.

You can tell that the artist took a lot of time and went to a lot of trouble to get this level of artistic skill into these photos.

But what about the quality of his work?

I know this is a controversial point, but do the photos deserve to have that much detail applied to them?

That is one of the major themes in the post that he gave us an inside look at.

I've heard some people complain that the images are fake or the photos are photoshopped.

Well, that is fine, but it's hard for me to argue that the quality of the images aren't worth the effort.

We get some incredible works from great artists here and I think you definitely ought to take note whenever you see one.

I think you will find that they are often a lot more elaborate and detailed than you would expect to see from the common artists we get.

But if you find that this level of detail isn't what you are looking for, then you can always stop by his Facebook page and browse his Instagram to see just what he has to offer.

All of the images in this post can be viewed here: http://www.michasz.com/art/

Now that you know who this artist is, I think you guys will agree that you would be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring this guy, who is incredibly well-known from his work on social media.

His work really can't be missed.<|endoftext|>I've been having an annoying problem with Unity 5. The last time it happened, I discovered that I had a "cannot access game object at this moment due to this object's lifetime not being complete" error which means the game was not displaying properly.

I searched for the cause of the issue and it turned out Unity 5 did not support object lifetime detection at all and therefore the game was using incorrect reference count and I had to create a second instance of the game object and assign a separate reference to it. Now, when I tried to load the first instance, I was told that the lifetime was complete which meant that the second instance would not even show up in the inspector and when I tried to assign one to this instance, the debugger would not even load the second instance from its internal storage.

The reason I was not getting this error during the last error log search was because the Unity 5 project was using a new Unity 5 feature. To make a long story short

(Newser) – "My child is a terrible liar," a Washington mom said this week, adding that she and her husband have a strict parenting policy: No, her son doesn't "say" it all the time. "My son is just really honest," the father said. "But you can't just let all that out." As an added precaution, the mom added, she will let him listen to music from about two to three seconds before it starts, "just in case he starts telling you a story," reports a family site called BabyCenter.com.

There are plenty who don't agree with the parents—or even the dad—on exactly what their son is saying, though many of them also say they have children who speak in the same "unreliable" manner. The National Institutes of Health notes that parents may have to adjust to their youngsters having a secret past life if they let it grow long. "People who speak in an unreliable voice may do so unintentionally, since it doesn't seem like anyone else is really listening," it says. "But you may need to give a child some time to adjust to a different voice so it doesn't appear he has a different personality."<|endoftext|>Marijuana policy in Texas

State laws

Cannabis is illegal in Texas.

Cultivation, possession, sale, and use of marijuana are illegal.

Sale, possession, or use of any amount (1 ounce) or more may result in criminal prosecution.

For questions about your local local laws that impact recreational or medicinal marijuana in Texas, consult with the appropriate city or county district attorney. In Dallas-Fort Worth, visit the DA's website.

Marijuana in schools

Texas law does not regulate the sale, delivery, or use of marijuana to minors. Schools are required to require teachers to report students to law enforcement when suspicious of such use.

Methadone

Methadone is a prescription medicine that is typically used for chronic pain caused by diseases, injuries and diseases or infections. The substance must be administered in strict, supervised doses.

Texas law prohibits the sale of methadone, except in a pharmacy or health care facility licensed and certified for this purpose.

Mental health

Mental illness is a medical diagnosis, as well as a state or federal requirement to receive treatment and support that is necessary to recover from the causes of the mental illness.

There are no criminal penalties for being evaluated or treated for a mental disorder. However, Texas law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, as long as the act is not a barrier to participation in a program.

Mental impairments may disqualify an individual from a state benefit program, but do not preclude receiving assistance from the state.

For questions about your local mental health treatment laws in Texas, consult the appropriate local district attorney.

Pills in public places

As medical marijuana becomes legal in Texas and as access increases to medical marijuana, more and more dispensaries are opening. If you go to a marijuana dispensary or similar business in Texas, you must still be 21 years of age to use the marijuana inside the establishment.

Under federal law, marijuana remains illegal under most circumstances. If you purchase marijuana in a state that has legalized the use of marijuana, you may be violating federal law.

Possession of marijuana by anyone under 21

There are very strict penalties for the possession of small amounts of marijuana by someone under 21 years old.

An individual may be punished in addition to the possible fines or jail time as follows:

Second-time offenders may be sentenced to up to one year at a minimum in county jail or up to 10 years at a maximum.

An individual who violates a sentence of confinement within five years of the date of the offense is subject to an additional two years of imprisonment or more.

Possession of more than five grams of marijuana remains a misdemeanor.

For questions about your city's marijuana laws, consult the appropriate county attorney.

Carrying marijuana

Possession of marijuana by an individual who is over 21 is still considered a misdemeanor under state law and may lead to arrest and incarceration. If you carry marijuana or open a package in your pocket, that may be a violation of Texas law.

No arrest and no criminal record is recorded once you leave Texas. However, you may lose certain employment opportunities, such as school or landlord applications.

Possessing less than ten grams of marijuana by someone under 21 can result in a misdemeanor, a fine of up to $500, and/or 30 days jail time. Possessing more than ten grams of marijuana by someone under 21 can result in an additional misdemeanor charge, up to up to one year.

Possession of marijuana in public

If an individual is found with marijuana in any public space, such as a park, street, or other public place, the person could face criminal charges or

MAY 20 -- A federal jury convicted David Allen Cozad of one count of receiving and distributing child pornography last night, when he admitted to sending photos of a 13-year-old girl's undressed buttocks to his friends and another 14-year-old girl, via the Internet.

The seven-woman, five-man deliberating panel deliberated for nearly two hours before returning the verdict in Federal District Court here.

The jurors found Cozad, 48, guilty of conspiracy to receive and distribute child pornography, and conspiracy to transport or receive a minor in exchange for compensation.

Cozad admitted to having sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old female friend of his niece, and he also admitted to having sexual intercourse with that 14-year-old girl.

Prosecutors accused Cozad of sexually soliciting and receiving photographs of the undressed buttocks of the 13-year-old, to which he exchanged photos of other women.

Cozad's attorney was not available for comment after the verdict was read.

An assistant U.S. attorney, Matthew Kacman, said after the verdict that Cozad is now in custody, facing up to 20 years in prison.

While Cozad admitted to distributing child pornography via the Internet, the government alleges that the 13-year-old girl did not willingly receive sexually explicit photographs of her from Cozad.

The 13-year-old girl is one of those photos Cozad distributed, but the other two pictures -- of the 14-year-old and another 14-year-old -- were provided to Cozad by his girlfriend, who had allegedly consented to receive nude photos of herself from Cozad, according to the government.

The government said after the trial that Cozad allegedly received some photos from his girlfriend -- though that girlfriend was actually another man.

In the aftermath of the discovery of those sexually explicit photographs in April, Cozad reportedly contacted the police, who interviewed him and the 14-year-old girl.

Kacman said the FBI recovered the photographs and additional evidence of Cozad's alleged conduct in the two cases from the 14-year-old girl.

But he said Cozad has been cooperative with the FBI, and he has been interviewed since the discovery of his inappropriate behavior with a minor, as well.

Cozad took his case to trial, where the trial judge, Nancy A. Powell, refused to grant him bail, saying that he is a flight risk because his past criminal history includes convictions for aggravated sexual assault, sex trafficking, unlawful sexual activity and transporting minors for sexual activity.

At the time, the judge said Cozad's criminal history was so extensive that he could pose a danger to society.

However, Cozad's attorney, Charles Brown, argued that the FBI's claims that his client is a danger to society were false.

Brown was unable to call to the stand the other two defendants in the case, who are scheduled to stand trial later this year.<|endoftext|>"I am proud to be part of our diverse city and community," said San Francisco Supervisor David Campos in a statement after the vote. "This vote represents decades of effort across generations and communities to make our City a more tolerant and welcoming place for all."

The vote came one day after a white, nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned violent, leaving one dead and more than 20 injured. On Monday, President Trump spoke out in a series of tweets suggesting the "alt-left" and "alt-right" were equally to blame for the events in Charlottesville.

"No one is saying that we have ever said that, but what we are saying in San Francisco is that we reject expressions of hate, and I think that is very important. I think it is important for me and for the rest of my City colleagues to condemn any and all expressions of white supremacy and bigotry, and to affirm our commitment to inclusion and acceptance and diversity in San Francisco," said Campos, who is running to replace outgoing Supervisor Hillary Ronen for a second term.

The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday also rejected a call to add a pro-immigration measure to the November ballot that was meant to replace controversial state legislation that bars undocumented immigrants from owning guns.

Supervisor Eric Mar said he was "troubled" that the resolution would have changed the definition of an ordinance to add a measure that would grant undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship — a bill sponsored by Mar that was defeated by a majority of City Hall supervisors in March.

"As a sanctuary city, we cannot allow our city to be used as a political pawn or our values to be traded upon political expediency," said Mar. "I voted against it because I am not prepared to let anyone use our city for political purposes in this time of national discord."<|endoftext|>It wasn't a banner year for Microsoft. In

We are in a state of crisis. This is not a political, national or global problem. It's a crisis of the human soul. And it's real – a crisis that has taken a deadly toll.

The American people are suffering from a crisis of moral clarity.

"When you see people who are living with a lot of trouble, who are feeling a lot of anxiety, that's not normal. It's not the way things should be."

That's Vice President Joe Biden, speaking from a Catholic conference in Washington, D.C., in September.

As if our society was still struggling with its past, that night, Biden told the faithful gathered at Georgetown University that we cannot "turn the other cheek" to evil.

We need to "go after evil" with "everything we've got."

It's the latest in Biden's speech to the Catholic conference that was interrupted by a barrage of hecklers. That is the kind of leadership that our country needs.

But Biden's comments were just one example of a wider crisis in America.

A week later on his "Meet the Press" program, Biden declared, "When you see people who are living with a lot of trouble, who are feeling a lot of anxiety, that's not normal. It's not the way things should be."

Yes, it is.

And it is a crisis that's threatening our nation as never before.

It's a crisis of America's most precious value: our humanity.

We are so troubled by what's happening in Gaza, but we are ignoring the suffering in Detroit.

We are ignoring the crisis in Flint, Michigan – a city that's become a symbol of American failure.

In a time of such pain in our nation, in such a state of confusion and distrust, it's easy to lose sight of what unites us. We forget that everyone who has given their all to make America – from the immigrants who've done so much to build our economy to our soldiers who defend us – has been enriched by the same God of justice and mercy who has given us all a common purpose.

That purpose, dear American, is that we are all sons and daughters of the same God: black, white, black and white, Latino and Latino, native and immigrant, Christian and Jewish, gay and straight, Democrat and Republican, Christian and Jewish, American and foreign.

We worship the same God; we believe in the same God.

And in common cause, the young people of the House and the Senate have written, I believe, a bill that will end violence against young gay Americans. It passes the most important test in the history of legislation: will it pass Congress?

And as we all pass our own little parts of the bill, I ask all of us to pass our most important parts of the bill. I ask all of us to see our friends – and those of my fellow Catholics – in a whole new way. I ask us to stop the hate in our hearts against anyone; against anyone's race, ethnicity, gender, class; against anyone's faith. I ask us to turn back the tide of injustice in our nation.

And when we do, we will once again have the privilege of defending freedom for the world to see, and the opportunity to make the world a better place for ourselves.

Thank you. God Bless You all.<|endoftext|>We've all dreamed of being a part of a project and working side by side to see our creation come to life. The same was true for photographer Aaron Treadwell:

With the help of a few other photographers, Mr. Treadwell has embarked on the long-term journey of photographing all 60 NFL teams. Aaron shares a little about the project below, and you can check out the progress of each team here.

What I'm attempting is something new. What I'm attempting is different. I want all the fans at home in 2015 to be connected to all the teams, to see their faces, see their jerseys, hear their song lyrics, and to watch in real time. They may not know who is on the other side of a camera in the back of a truck with an assistant, nor may they know how many people are behind those doors in the training room or at the facility. I think when people get to visit the teams they will all appreciate the time and efforts involved with this project because when they see the work each team has invested, they will understand the amount of money, time, and time these teams are spending to be the best possible football team we can be in this lifetime.

A small child was among the 12 people killed in a blast in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar that wounded at least 90 others, officials said on Thursday.

Faisal Ahmed Bibi, of the Hazara community, which is from Afghanistan, was among 10 people in her family who were killed when a bomb exploded outside a mosque at about 8:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) near a shopping complex.

Bibi's cousin, who was also in the mosque at the time, was injured by shrapnel and died on Wednesday morning, Lahore Police Chief Asad Ahmed told the Associated Press.

He told local media he believes the suicide bomber entered as one of the worshippers was leaving the site.

The deceased children were aged between seven and 13 years old and included one boy and two girls, said Khan Shahin, a senior police officer in the city.

The mosque is just a 10-minute walk away from the Hazara bazaar, where the bombers had been spotted the previous day, Bibi's sister Wahida told the Express Tribune newspaper.

The blast also injured a senior member of the local security forces. The unnamed officers were rushed to hospital where they were pronounced dead, according to authorities.

A senior army officer confirmed that a security meeting had been called to discuss security issues following Sunday's suicide blast.

In November, around a dozen Hazara community members were killed in two blasts in Karachi province. They were killed after two suicide bombers targeted a gathering for a religious pilgrimage.

Last year, Pakistan was rocked by a massive attack at a police academy in Quetta in which 150 people were killed.

Pakistan is a country where the majority of people belong to the Hazara Shi'ite minority and many live in poverty and abuse by law enforcement due to their religious identity.

The United States was among many Western states, particularly its NATO ally, which strongly condemned the Karachi attack.

It condemned the act of terrorism and expressed its support on the continuing efforts of Pakistan to combat such groups and improve security.

UAE's Sheikh Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Qasimi condemned the "heinous terrorist attack against innocent pilgrims" in a statement Wednesday evening. He said the Islamic Emirates stood "ready to provide all help to the government of Pakistan in combatting the evil that is terrorism, whether in Pakistan, Afghanistan or anywhere else in the region."

An international day of prayer for victims of terrorism is being held on Thursday in Hazara communities all over Pakistan.<|endoftext|>SACRAMENTO, Calif. - Today, the Sacramento City Council passed a comprehensive citywide plan that will modernize and expand the city's transportation system, create green infrastructure and make it easier for people to start a business in Sacramento. The Council also agreed to implement an updated and more transparent process for evaluating the growth and redevelopment impact of any future transit project.

The final budget includes nearly $800 million allocated for capital projects. This funding includes $600 million for building new transit lines such as the Green Line Extension (GLX) and new bus routes. Funding is also allocated to improve transit for the disabled, make street trees more friendly to people with disabilities, reduce car traffic and improve pedestrian and biking connections.

Councilmember Steve Hansen's Transit and Green Infrastructure Committee proposed the plan, which will create a new agency called Central City Solutions (CCS). CCS will be responsible for all capital projects approved by the Council and will have the flexibility to design and create new transit routes, integrate Green Infrastructure upgrades with existing transit systems, and monitor and adjust those investments to create a balanced transportation network in Sacramento.

Councilmember Joe Crisafulli said, "This funding is an important step towards modernizing and expanding Sacramento's urban transit system. It also puts the city on track to meet the state's climate protection goals for greenhouse gas reductions by 2035. It is my hope that the council will take other important steps in the future to ensure our community remains a livable, walkable, and vibrant community for people to be proud of."

CCS Deputy Director of Planning and Development Jonathan Jones said the new plan takes Sacramento's transit system to the next level through innovative technologies of the future. He added, "It's going to require all of us on this council to lead by making the investments we know it takes. By taking a long hard look into every project and making sure it fulfills Council's goal of creating a diverse, walkable, bikeable, transit friendly community, we can achieve what it takes to transform Sacramento's transportation network for the sustainable future of our city and the rest of California."

Committee members said it was important that the plan also included a framework for integrating the growth and redevelopment needs of future transit projects. Councilmember Michael Atkins said "It's unfortunate that our council members did not include a robust framework for planning new transit projects. I have no doubt that it would bring a great deal to the planning process. It

A group of anti-Trump protesters was attacked in a Boston hotel, and one man was fatally shot by police who say he was armed with a paintball gun

A man armed with a paintball gun was fatally shot by police Saturday at a gathering of anti-Trump protesters in Boston, authorities said.

In a statement, police said the man, 26-year-old Darrius Kennedy, of Dorchester, was wearing a mask when he approached protesters outside the Hyatt Regency in Boston's South End and opened fire with a paintball. Kennedy was hit six times.

"The suspect is an active member in the Boston chapter of the Antifa movement," police said, referring to supporters of violent anti-fascist groups.

Police officers opened fire to stop Kennedy's advance, officials said. He was arrested and is facing charges, including murder and bombing by use of an explosive.

The event, which called for a protest against "a racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, anti-immigrant, climate change-denying, anti-gay, anti-trans, and anti-Semitic administration", was organised by the Massachusetts branch of the Women's March and the group Refuse Fascism.

It started at 5pm and police said about two dozen people had gathered at South Boston Common, south of the Hyatt. According to a Facebook event page, they came in order to show their disdain for President Donald Trump and his policies.

Police said Kennedy entered the protest through the chain-link fence and began firing at about 5.30pm, hitting four protesters.

Two of the dead were in their 20s-30s, the Boston Police Department said.

"One victim was struck in the chest; two others were struck by paintball-propelled pellets. One victim was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he died," said Boston police spokesman David Procopio.

A fourth person, who was listed in serious condition at Massachusetts General, was treated at a nearby hospital and released, the spokesman said. Procopio said police later identified the victims as 18-year-old Yassin Bey, of Boston, and 23-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, of Cambridge, and 21-year-old Sarah Glover, of Boston.

Procopio described the man as a white male with "dark hair".

"The suspect displayed a paintball gun with a paintball gun on his waist and in his hand. Paintball guns shoot paintballs. There's no telling if that's a real gun or what it was that he was carrying," Procopio said.

Police said they believe the man has "anti-government leanings", with "dark hair". The man was wearing a jacket and dark jeans

"While this was a peaceful demonstration and the majority of demonstrators were law-abiding and respectful of police, one of the incidents on Saturday stemmed from an altercation that began between two persons," a statement from the department said.

"During the altercation, the suspect was armed with what turned out to be a homemade paintball gun, similar to those frequently seen at paintball tournaments. The suspect then proceeded to fire several rounds at the demonstrators.

"After firing several rounds at the demonstrators, the suspect moved from the demonstration area and into a nearby private residence located on the property where the suspect was located and arrested.

"This suspect will be presented to the Framingham district attorney for charges that include murder, bombing, and carrying a handgun without a permit from the Massachusetts gun laws."

Police said the suspect was arrested a few hours after the shooting but has not been made public until now.

Menino tweeted: "My deepest condolences to the family and friends of the person shot at South Boston Common today, a member of our Boston community."

Menino was joined at a press conference in Boston by Boston police commissioner William Evans, Boston mayor Marty Walsh and Suffolk district attorney Daniel Conley.

"He had a paintball gun," Conley said. "He was carrying a paintball gun, so it was obviously a dangerous and frightening situation."

Menino said the anti-Trump protesters were peaceful, although there was a small group of "some agitators that were not protesters".

Evans said: "There were about 200 people there, most of them law enforcement officers and the overwhelming majority were protestors. We had some agitators that were a

The US military said Russia's intervention in Syria last week was "not helping" the fight against Islamic State militants and warned against further action by Moscow, while also praising the Syrian government's efforts against the insurgency.

"The Russian intervention in Syria is not helping ISIL," said Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top US commander in Iraq and Syria, referring to Islamic State by its acronyms.

But in a rare comment on Russia's role in the global conflict, he said "the use of those airfields, of the use of those Russian forces - that's the Russians. They're the ones that have provided the air support for that offensive in Raqqa - that was done by the Russians. It was a Russian contribution."

In recent days, Moscow has announced multiple air strikes on Islamic State in Syria, including those conducted within Syria's borders. Russian President Bashar Assad has vowed that "terrorists have nothing to fear" from further Russian involvement in his war against the group.

On Monday, Russian fighter jets launched two air strikes in Syria and destroyed an Islamic State unit in the al-Rai neighbourhood on the western outskirts of Aleppo. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also announced that over 8,000 civilians were evacuated from Aleppo on Sunday. It remains unclear how many of the dead were IS fighters, however.

Russian forces are also alleged to have taken parts of Syria near the Iraqi border, while US-led coalition jets have conducted air strikes inside Syrian and Iraq against Islamic State targets.

On Thursday, the Pentagon said it targeted Islamic State in Syria with Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from the USS Porter. Townsend said US aircraft were the origin of the strikes despite US officials previously claiming it was Russian-led coalition jets.

Washington and Moscow are engaged in a fierce battle for Syria's air territory. Moscow has insisted the deployment of Russian troops in Syria were strictly humanitarian. While the US and its allies say Russia's intervention is a violation of the country's borders and that the Kremlin is targeting mostly moderate opposition, including a number of US- backed rebels.

Last week, the United Nations and Amnesty International accused Russia of continuing attacks on opposition and civilian areas in Syria and of a flagrant violation of international law by bombing medical clinics and civilian infrastructure. They also warned that civilians are being deliberately targeted and the country's opposition forces have been reduced to rubble. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that relies on a network of activists on the ground in Syria, has put the number of areas hit by Russian airstrikes in September on the rise. It said at least 13 civilian areas had experienced serious damage this month alone, compared to just one in September 2016.

Townsend told reporters on Friday that "we're not going to play with Russian aircraft. We're not going to get in their way and we're not going to try to get some kind of an agreement on who does what.

"We've talked to them repeatedly over the last number of days. We're not looking for some kind of understanding here. We're simply saying we need to look at the results before we even talk about anything here, and that means if they've done more in the last 24 hours then we have to look at that."

He said that despite warnings from the international community, Russia has refused to stop the airstrikes. "It doesn't make them any more or less dangerous," he said. "This is the fourth group of civilian-heavy strikes since the last announcement we've made, and the last one was over the weekend. It is very difficult for us to coordinate or even communicate with them on what we're doing, and because of that we are having an increasingly difficult time with regard to coordinating our effort to help people. To that end, we have increased our presence in Iraq, which will allow us to have more direct communication between US and Iraqi forces on the ground and so forth. But this is about what it represents. I've said many times that the fight against ISIS is about getting rid of ISIS. And if they're taking casualties, that's part of it, but if that's what they are doing, then that's something we have to stay clear of. And I don't see any military options under review."

US military officials told Reuters on Sunday that Russia's air campaign might be "doubling down" on strikes in Syria and Iraq.

"We're still assessing the results of the Russian campaign and it might shift," said Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook, adding that the US was focused on working with Iraq to defeat ISIS.

US Defense Secretary James Mattis had also said that Russian strikes against terrorists in Syria were hitting "very little Islamic State positions, in fact they

Rafael Benitez is the new manager of Newcastle United as the club confirmed the appointment of Steve McClaren for the club's next Premier League campaign.

McClaren, who took the England job earlier this week in a shock switch from Derby County, was appointed by Sir John Carver.

Benitez, 50, led Sevilla to victory in La Liga in his first season, having joined them from Inter Milan in 2010. He guided Newcastle to seventh in the Premier League this season and 14th in the League Cup.

The Spaniard said: "I am very happy to be here and to work with Steve."

The club added: "Steve has been appointed manager of Newcastle United, subject to obtaining a work permit and passing a medical."

McClaren's arrival brings to an end an 11-month saga that started when he was sacked as England manager by the Football Association last summer and brought about a long-running stand-off between Newcastle and the Professional Footballers' Association.

McClaren did not receive a written response from PFA chief Gordon Taylor, who had been due to meet him this week. The PFA has since refused to comment on rumours of internal disquiet over his appointment.

McClaren told a news conference that he had "tried to be as positive as I knew how, but they weren't doing anything else".

"It's been a very difficult period, for myself and the club," he said. "Hopefully we'll soon find out how the PFA are doing today when I'm meeting them, and we can move on again."

McClaren led Liverpool to third place in the Premier League this season and was named the PFA's coach of the year in September.

He had told BBC Radio 5 live that he was not interested in a job at Liverpool, Liverpool's main domestic rivals. "Of course not, I have had a hugely enjoyable time at Liverpool over the last couple of years so I am absolutely not interested," he said.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: "I know Steve. I've worked with him and like him very much. I spoke to him and his future was still very much on the table in terms of what his relationship with his manager, Jurgen Klopp, and the manager of Newcastle United, Steve McClaren, is for the next two or three years."

Rafa Benitez, pictured at Swansea on Thursday, will manage Newcastle

Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who has not been linked with a move to Newcastle, revealed after his sacking in May that he believed Newcastle "lack ambition and are not trying to be competitive. I like them the way they are right now".

"Benitez did a fantastic job and will be recognised for that," added Wenger on his website. "But it looks like the time for him to go is near."

Steve Stone of online betting company Ladbrokes wrote on Twitter that Benitez would be "worth £6 when he leaves Newcastle" - £4 more than the bookmakers' odds.

McClaren, who will be paid about £4m per year from Newcastle, came close to joining Real Madrid earlier this month, but the club refused to meet his wages demands.

Benitez said: "I know my job will be to carry on the way we have started the season, but more importantly to put Newcastle at the front of the Championship race and put us in position to be successful next season."

Newcastle, who sacked the sacked Mark Hughes last month, have also been linked with the services of Sam Allardyce, the West Ham manager, and Tim Sherwood, the Tottenham manager.

However, despite being backed by owner Mike Ashley, McClaren has insisted he would only leave the club on a two-year contract. The former England defender told BBC Radio 5 live: "I would be very shocked if the PFA were to find any sort of discontent amongst the players, and that's my main focus. I don't think anybody would be surprised if people in the football world are surprised to hear that. I think it would be a big upset for the club if anything got lost as a result of that."

Newcastle's new boss would be charged with the task of trying to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, something that Ashley has promised will be his priority when he has taken control of the club.

But McClaren, whose arrival at St James' Park is likely to be accompanied by a change of style, indicated the club's ambition will be not just stay in the division. He added: "We're in the business of playing football, scoring goals and having big competitions and getting players to work for Newcastle.

"You'll just have to wait and see how the next one goes and how I manage that. I think my biggest challenge right now is going out and trying to put Newcastle in the position

(CNN) The Russian Foreign Ministry warned Tuesday that President Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey could threaten America's democracy and said "it is necessary to watch carefully if some steps are taken, to prevent any harm from the decisions."

"It is necessary to watch carefully if some steps are taken, to prevent any harm from the decisions," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said during a news briefing at the ministry where he said Moscow wanted to "hear Trump's words carefully."

Trump fired Comey a week ago Tuesday -- after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 conference in Hamburg, Germany.

In his firing letter to Comey, Trump wrote , "While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau."

On Friday, Trump called on the Justice Department and the FBI to clarify "whether the President's statements about me were statements of fact or statements of opinion," and said he was placing his personal reputation "in danger."

Russian media later quoted Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as saying that Trump's statement was not an opinion, and Rosenstein has not addressed this assertion.

Ryabkov called Trump's decision "a provocation and violation of basic norms of international law," and said Moscow "will not leave him unattended, even for a moment."

The following is an excerpt from the article "The Nature of Mental Illness," published in Mental Retardation (Vol. 7, No. 4), May 1975, pp. 518-523.

The term mental retardation was coined by American psychiatrist Henry Pernsteiner in the early 1930s to describe children born "slow-headed." It has since grown into a broader term used for any child of limited intelligence whose physical and learning abilities remain retarded throughout his life. It has become increasingly important in the past decade to define mental retardation more clearly and to understand how it is defined today.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which adopted the definition from a consensus statement of several professional committees and organizations (1), now considers individuals with mental retardation to be those who fall below the third standard, the cutoff for persons who are so retarded that they have "subnormal" brain function but "normal" learning abilities and who exhibit no significant disabilities in adaptive behaviors (including social skills), educational achievement, or vocational activities (2). Although the cutoff was first adopted in 1968, AAP has not revised its practice of categorizing children with mental retardation by age (3).

A major change in AAP policy is the change to a cutoff of 70 IQ points above the mean. The rationale was that the average IQ obtained by children with mental retardation during childhood is about 70, with an average rise to about 80 between the ages of 11 and 13 (4). Thus, the cutoff is intended to allow for a decline to 70 of average mental development from the point of onset of retarded children's intellectual function.

In recent years, the consensus committee that drafted the definition of mental retardation noted that some members felt that the threshold for this condition was too high (5). The committee concluded that because the definition of mental retardation was originally defined to allow for a decline of average mental function from the point of onset of retarded children's intellectual capability—the point of onset—it was necessary to define the condition from the perspective of early development. The committee concluded that mental retardation was best understood as a syndrome that began with the onset of retarded children's intellectual ability and continued through a period of development that is marked by substantial learning disability and with significant developmental delay until the onset of normal age.

To facilitate this definition, the committee established a criterion to be applied at the time of the initial diagnosis of severe developmental delayedness (SDDL) rather than at the time of the diagnostic test. In these instances, mental retardation is identified in the presence of an intellectual disability, defined as mental retardation that has been clinically established as being caused by chromosomal disorder, severe learning disability, cerebral palsy, organic brain syndrome, traumatic injury, drug intoxication, mental retardation, or other medical condition (5). The committee also recommended that in cases of severe developmental delay or multiple disabilities, an IQ of at least 70 be maintained throughout development.

A review of the diagnostic criteria used by the Society for Developmental Disabilities of California defines five subcategories of a severe developmental delay, each with four levels of severity (6). The first subcategory includes children with mild to moderate developmental delay or disability, whose IQs average 70 to 75. The second subcategory includes children with moderate to severe developmental delay or disability, whose IQs average 75 to 80, with an IQ reduction to 70 in the presence of major functional abnormalities.

This article is about the character. For the music album, see "The Last Of Our Kind (The Original)" (live album).

The Last Of Our Kind is an American contemporary folk-rock band formed in Washington D.C. in 1995. The group's music has been described by the critics as "an amalgam of indie pop, soul, soul pop and traditional acoustic folk, and a blend of country, bluegrass, roots, blues and punk."

Contents show]

History Edit

The band formed in 1995 by members who had attended the nearby Berklee College of Music. Their name was inspired by the lyric of an American spiritual and political activist who had a similar name: Leonard Peltier. Peltier was an African American activist who had been arrested for protesting the theft of land from Native Americans.

Before their debut, a few other bands from the Berklee College of Music had already begun working on a collaboration CD. Among them were a band called "The Changelables" and a band called "Jazz For Kids With Autism", which the band decided to call their own band. The band was originally called "The Last Of Our Kind," with the group itself being called "LOWE".

After playing a few shows in Washington DC, the main five members of LOWE were invited to play a showcase in New York City on November 15, 1995. The first show at the venue was recorded for YouTube and the DVD of that performance is also available.

In the years since their debut, they have released two full-length albums under the "The Last Of Our Kind" stage name, both of which are based on the theme of traditional folk songs. For their second album, "An Appointment In Hell", Lows guitarist/vocalist Jeff Loomis replaced Jim DeMarco, the second member of LOWE with whom he had recorded his debut album, "I Hear Your Voice Inside Me (The Original)" (1993). Loomis' guitar style is more melodic and less crunchy than DeMarco's. He also contributed more of an acoustic guitar to the songs on An Appointment in Hell, such as "The Last Of Our Kind (The Original)", "An Appointment in Hell" and "Last Of Our Kind (The Original)".

Lows also recorded several more live albums. "Last Of Our Kind (Live at the Roxy)" is a compilation album documenting several concerts played in New York, including performances at the Roxy (the opening band for Trombone Shorty who later became the opening band for Trombone Shorty And The Violators, and a couple of Lows songs performed with the Roxy crowd, including "An Appointment In Hell"), and shows in Philadelphia, Boston and Hartford. The other live album which takes place in Washington is "Last Of Our Kind (Live at the Beacon Theatre)", the concert recording from the Beacon Theater in Washington DC. This live album, recorded on March 25, 2008, is the most "realistic" of the three. This song is one of the longest songs of the set and features several acoustic guitar tracks and Loomis' vocals. "Last Of Our Kind (Live at The Blue Note)", recorded at the Blue Note in New York on November 30, 1995, is probably the darkest/moodiest of the three. It was also the only "realistic" performance and was performed without any microphones or mics on the audience.

In 1997, Lowe changed their stage name to The Last Of Our Kind, partly to match the "tribute bands" created like the The Lost Bay Area String Band (1998), The Last of the Pharoahs (1998), The Last of the Pharoahs (1997) among others, and to reflect the new focus on songs and less on the band members. In the years following this it was announced that a new album of "The Last of Our Kind" songs would be released every three years following the release of last. "A Last Of Our Kind" was released on April 26, 2008 and was the first studio album since the group's debut.

In 2010, Lowe announced that they were to be releasing a third album, on April 11th, the next day is the 40th anniversary of the American Civil Liberties Union/National Lawyers Guild song which was the inspiration for the title, "An Appointment in Hell". A live album, "Live at the Beacon Theatre", was released in the same week. The album has only been released on CD, in part to capitalize on the anniversary, in part to make the live recordings of the band available to a wider audience.

In August 2011, The Last of Our Kind had announced an extensive world tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their first concert. The series of concerts will include two shows in Japan on October 21st and 22nd, followed by New York on November 12th. This will be their first-ever US tour. The band

In 2016, the City Council passed a moratorium on cannabis businesses after concerns were raised over the safety of children coming into contact with the plant. City officials claimed marijuana dispensaries posed risks of increased traffic congestion, increased street crime, child protection issues, and public health concerns.

Despite the ban, eight dispensaries were operating in town, allowing more than 2,500 customers to procure medical marijuana. Those same dispensaries continued to operate across the city even though city officials had previously issued them notices of nuisance and safety violations.

"The Boston Medical Marijuana Dispensary Ordinance is obsolete but the law is a clear violation of patients' First Amendment rights," said attorney Jeff Greenfield. "It is illegal for the City of Boston to tell a patient and their doctor that they are not allowed to sell marijuana," he continued. "The state Legislature and Governor should immediately lift these bans and let patients and their doctors, in accordance with their medical decisions, decide whether and how they want to treat their ailments and illnesses."

Greenfield and his attorneys are representing an array of patients who believe the bans are violating their First Amendment right to access medical cannabis.<|endoftext|>"No matter what it looks like you should be able to find it."

The legislation will provide $1.047 trillion, which is a $74 billion increase from January's current funding levels.

The Senate budget resolution will provide $1.014 trillion, a $40 billion increase from January's funding levels.

The Senate budget resolution will provide $1.029 trillion, and also $50 billion more than February's levels for defense, a $50 billion increase.

The House's budget resolution will provide $1.008 trillion, which is an increase of $38 billion for defense and $30 billion for nondefense.

Both chambers are trying to address a number of concerns. Most striking is a cut in the domestic discretionary program, which includes programs for farmers, the poor and disabled, from $2.1 trillion this year to $1.949 trillion over the next decade.

The House budget resolution also would give $50 billion for emergency disaster assistance, which is a major increase from $37 billion in December.

The Senate budget resolution, however, would provide $60 billion for disaster relief, a decrease from $74 billion in a December bill. The GOP-led House last week approved a $60 billion disaster relief measure.

John Morton, who has been director of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) since March, will be succeeded Friday by Lisa Monaco, a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Maricopa County (Ariz.) Sheriff Joe Arpaio has already praised Monaco as the perfect replacement. The lawman has repeatedly defended the idea that local law enforcement agents "may do more to investigate and detain" illegal immigrants than federal immigration agents.

"Sheriff Joe's comments reflect the strong support the public has for his efforts to enforce the law and prevent dangerous criminal aliens and illegal aliens from harming the citizens of Maricopa County," said Arpaio.

"It is clear that [Marino] is the right choice not only for the office, but for the job," he said in a statement.

Marino, who currently serves as deputy assistant attorney general in the department's Criminal Division, will take over for Morton.

"As many of you know, it's been a privilege to serve in this role," Morton told the agency's workforce in a memo.

"I have been blessed to work with outstanding employees in a leadership position who share my passion for law and justice. You have a tremendous amount of responsibility to perform, yet much of what you do is often in the shadows or overlooked by the broader public," he added.

Morton began at the agency in 2012 after serving as chief counsel for the Committee on Financial Services on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, according to a release on DHS's website.

"I look forward to continuing to work with my friends, colleagues, and the people of the United States in the years to come," said Martin.

"But I will always feel deeply proud of the many thousands of people I worked with that made an enormous difference for the betterment of my country, both in Washington and along the Mexican Border. And for that, I will say to you, I am truly grateful."

Morton has also served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.<|endoftext|>The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.

Andrew Baeumler: Hello everyone! I am Andrew Baeumler, former lead artist at CryEngine and now working for a small indie game company in Germany. I am the new designer, art director, voice actor, writer and writer on the upcoming game "Shelter". You can visit our website here: Shelter.ch.

Today I am going to tell you a story that is going to give you an idea of what's to come, but let me begin with something completely different: my experiences as an artist on the CryEngine.

A while, long ago in the CryEngine days I started getting my own game engine, and I was pretty happy with it. I developed a small 2D platformer called "Pump-Man" that took about 4 days to make, based on a 2D art style similar to some of the best 2D platformers out there (Gigantic; Banjo-Kazooie; The Secret Quest). This was something like 15 years ago. But the engine was just a small one. Then, in 2001 the 3D artist that I was working with (Dennis Heilmann, the man who designed the engine for me) moved from Austria to Australia, in the end to

A video of a police officer kicking an apparent disabled man on the ground is stirring outrage on Twitter.

The two videos, both posted by Youtube user "Mitcha" on Thursday, show that the officer, who has been identified as officer Jeremy Dearman, kicks the man while he is lying on the asphalt on a quiet, deserted street.

In the first video, which was posted on Twitter by activist Shaun King, Dearman is seen standing in an unmarked police vehicle before being approached by a man who is speaking English and saying he lives in San Diego. Another passenger in the car later appears and asks the man if he is deaf.

The passenger, who King identifies as a young child, asks how the man could have broken his leg. The man replies in broken English.

Dearman, who is wearing blue shorts and a black t-shirt, then walks up to the man. He is then shown walking away from the passenger before returning to the street. Dearman then kicks the man with one leg while keeping the other in a raised position.

"Hey, get your damn hands up and walk!" Dearman screams. The video also shows the man with his hands behind his back. "Get your hands up, now," he continues.

Dearman then picks up the man and throws him to the ground, in some cases kicking him in the head. At one point, the man appears to be kneeling on his knees. He is then rolled over by Dearman again before being left at the end of the block.

According to King, the man told him he was a former Marine but has never fired a weapon.

"This is not an accident. This is not a mistake," King says in the video. "This is a man being beaten, kicked and stomped by an officer with no apparent reason."

He added that he would be filing a police misconduct complaint.

Dearman was not available to speak on Wednesday.

This is not the first time that Dearman has come under attack after video surfaced. In 2012, he was accused of threatening a former girlfriend in an email titled "Warning, she will get a gun and shoot me dead" that left dozens of questions unanswered.

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has not responded to requests for comment from CNN. On August 17, the department issued a statement that said the department takes all requests for public comment regarding the incident "extremely seriously."

"Deputy Dearman remains on leave while the Police Department's internal affairs is conducting its investigation into this matter," Sgt. Lisa Bowman said. "If you have any information to share or if you have concerns about this situation, you can help by calling 949-824-5011."

Another San Diego native, journalist and activist Shaun King tweeted that Dearman had previously been involved in an incident with him in 2012.

Dearman and I were on a date on September 4th, 2012 while covering Occupy San Diego. He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me, in front of my friends, in a parking lot when I refused his request to move to the curb. #stoptheviolence — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 28, 2014

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department issued an update last month on the investigation into the death of 32-year-old homeless man Kelly Thomas, who died in December 2010 after being pushed by officers and handcuffed for several hours. The investigation found that Thomas could possibly have died as a result of a lack of air, but that other factors were "considered."<|endoftext|>I got a lot of good pictures, you can clearly tell this is a new game.

The 2015 Global Competitiveness Report finds that the United States continues to be the world's premier economy, even though the job market for younger Americans has not fully recovered from the downturn. The country's economy has become more competitive since the 1970s and has held onto its lead since the Great Recession. The country is now the world's number one destination for international business.

According to the report, more than 20 percent of U.S. workers lack the necessary skill sets for global competitiveness. And, the U.S. has lagged behind other highly sophisticated countries, which have been moving into the high-skill service industry, while remaining in the technology sector.

"This report has made a critical contribution to our understanding of the global economy and the drivers behind its emergence," said Klaus Schwab, Chair of the WEF's Executive Committee. "There is much to be concerned about, as a country like the US, where so many individuals work in the service sector, needs to become more competitive. However, this should not be viewed as a challenge in any way."

However, the report notes that, given the size of the U.S. economy, the gap between our ability to lead the industrial race and our need for talent to meet that demand is becoming wider each year.

"Given our size, its economy and its diversity, the United States has an important role to play in reshaping the 21st century to better balance the needs of business and society," said Klaus Schwab. "Today, many high-skilled, high-productive jobs are not accessible to those who are not native English speakers or native speakers of another language."

And in addition to those challenges, it is also necessary to focus U.S. efforts in those key strategic regions where opportunities are limited, such as emerging economies. The report notes that the United States must ensure that it remains competitive, in part, by ensuring that its own economic prosperity does not put unnecessary downward pressure on the international competitiveness of other countries.

"Global business and business leaders, including President Obama, need to invest more in areas like education and training, innovation, trade and foreign investment, in an effort to build a world-class economy that will sustain America's global leadership," noted Klaus Schwab,

The NIH study, which is based on data gathered in the 2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey shows that just over 60% of the population lacks enough physical activity each week. Of that group, just over 40% believe having less than 3 hours of exercise a week is sufficient.

The report also indicated that, when it comes to health, there are several different aspects to fitness, all of which involve varying amounts of exercise for a different number of total hours a week. Of the factors associated with better or worse health, the primary factors were diet and exercise. For example, obesity may be a factor in some cases of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, in those ages 20-44, physical activity was correlated with a better outlook on life. Those with a greater amount of daily physical activity had a lower incidence of depressive symptoms, a lower rate of smoking, and lower likelihood of using multiple sources of tobacco, such as cigars and pipes.

Exercise can also make a difference in terms of life expectancy in this country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, men in the United States who participate in regular fitness exercise are 30% less likely to die sooner than men who do not engage in such exercise. Men who are active at least two times a week, or 150 minutes of exercise per week, are more likely to live an additional 11 years than their inactive counterparts. Of course, for the average person who is active, it is difficult to determine the exact percentages and the numbers, but it is safe to say that it is time to take steps towards being more active and fit for the 21st century.

======================================== SAMPLE 79 ========================================
In her first full day as mayor, Lorne Bozinoff was greeted by a long line that stretched down a sidewalk in front of the city hall building.

This comes on the heels of the announcement that Bozinoff has been selected as the new chief in charge of policing.

Bozinoff, a former RCMP officer, was appointed Winnipeg's first-ever chief of police early last month. Bozinoff, 44, told CBC News he's looking forward to working with city hall, the community and residents across the city going forward.

He said he has the mandate to implement a strategic plan to ensure Winnipeg stays safe. He noted that the City of Winnipeg's annual Police and Fire Information (PFI) report indicates there were nearly 658 homicides and almost 2,800 non-fatality firearm incidents in 2015.

"It is not just a crime prevention report, it's about public safety," Bozinoff said. "It's making sure every person is safe living in our city."

Winnipeg's police department has been at the centre of a recent controversy.

A report released by the Office of the Independent Police Review Director in late May revealed that officers inappropriately searched two people in 2013, and then "improperly detained" and "abusive" force was used against a third person.

Bozinoff said he's working on building a police culture that is "professionalized, transparent, accountable," as a result, of the decision.

Bozinoff noted that the Independent Police Review Director's report was "not the entire picture."

He said he is also looking at the recommendations in the PFI report.

"The report suggests, and I share those, this type of information has never been kept confidential in the past," he added.

In his letter of acceptance on Tuesday, Bozinoff also thanked the city for the honour of the appointment, saying it was one of the greatest things he's done in his professional life.

The Manitoba Police Association (MPA) and the Professional Association for Public Safety Management (PasMP) were pleased to accept Bozinoff's appointment. The union said they recognize what is a challenging time to be an officer at the Winnipeg Police Service with the recent announcement concerning the hiring of Chief Mark Saunders.

"We hope that Mr. Bozinoff's efforts will be welcomed by the members," said MPA spokesman Dave Selby.

He said the membership also hopes to be part of the decisions made in regards to hiring the Chief's replacement.

PasMP president and CEO Tom Longmire said the decision was made in consultation with members, and that he hoped Bozinoff will "lead on these major issues, and make sure we keep Winnipeg safe for everyone."

'It's a huge job'

Bozinoff said he has been spending some time with the MPA and is already engaged in conversations he hopes will help inform the process surrounding the future of the Winnipeg Police Service.

He told CBC News he also has spoken with Chief Saunders in the past few days.

"I've had a chance to sit down with Chief Saunders to talk about what to do," Bozinoff said. "It's not something I'm surprised, he and I have talked about the same things we've talked about for years, how do we get back on track with our police force and keep Winnipeg safe."

Bozinoff is a police officer from Prince Albert, Sask.

Bozinoff said he doesn't plan on going too far off-track in the search for a Police Services Board of Review that will run for three or four years and look into police disciplinary action.

"I think it's a big job at a big time, [The Chief is] going to need it as well," said Bozinoff. He added that he understands the frustration with the board being appointed in the first place, after a process that has been riddled with controversy, and now with the appointment of his selection.

As for the future, Bozinoff emphasized that he does not expect the Winnipeg Police Service to shrink. He said he's going to go on the offensive and not shrink the police division.

"I'm a policeman, I want the Winnipeg Police Service to stay strong, strong and healthy for the residents in Winnipeg," said Bozinoff.<|endoftext|>Rudolf Vrba, son of the notorious dictator Ferdinand von Habsburg, escaped to Italy in 1943 when the Nazis demanded his extradition, only to be betrayed and executed in the same year.

A new report released Monday by the nonpartisan Center for American Progress (CAP) details the disproportionate impact that mass incarceration has on people of color and poor people throughout the United States, and argues that lawmakers should be listening less to lobby groups that represent the interests of those at the bottom of the economic ladder.

"The criminal justice system has the greatest racial disparities of any major system of punishment in the United States, impacting African-American males in particular, whose chances of becoming a future offender are over six times greater than those of white men," according to a report released Monday by the Center for American Progress (CAP), titled "A National Public Safety Challenge: How Mass Incarceration Affects Racial Disparities in Crime and Inequality."

The report analyzed data on U.S. crime rates from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which breaks down crime statistics based on where each crime took place in terms of geographic area, state, and race. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of law enforcement agencies rose from roughly 300 to almost 3,000, which increased the overall number of crimes reported in the country by more than 800 percent.

The report found that of all the crimes that occurred in 2002, half took place in just four states: California, Florida, New York and Texas – and, the federal Bureau of Prisons' Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 2012, those four states held approximately half of all prisoners in the United States.

Over the last three decades – which saw a sharp increase in the federal prison system from about 30,000 prisoners in 1980 to about 370,000 inmates in 2012 – the ratio of black men to white men in state prisons has increased nearly seven-fold – from 1.5 to six to one over the three decades.

"From a criminal justice perspective, mass incarceration has contributed to a massive increase in both rates of incarceration and recidivism relative to white men," according to the report.<|endoftext|>The White House has announced the naming of four new ambassadors to the United Nations in the days ahead of the General Assembly's first high-level engagement between the Trump administration and the United Nations (UN).

Two of the nominees – Ambassador Keith Harper of the UK and Ambassador Daniel Rubinstein of Israel – have served as ambassadors in their countries during the past decade, while Ambassador Anne Patterson – President Trump's pick to serve as United States Permanent Representative to the UN – is the first openly-LGBT ambassador to ever be nominated for such a position.

"The United Nations and its work are vital to our nation's security and prosperity, as well as its moral compass. As a result, it is absolutely critical that the UN be properly funded and that it be a place where nations are judged on what they achieve, rather than what they inflict," Trump told the United Nations General Assembly at his first address to the world body since becoming president last Friday.

"We look forward to making America proud and doing everything in our power to help achieve that goal through the support of our friends and allies."

According to the Office of Government Ethics, all White House nominees must sign a "Statement of Official Residence," which declares that the person seeking the job has, "willfully violated federal, state or local laws in order to obtain or retain employment, or to obtain or retain employment for a spouse."

The White House has not yet released a copy of the statement outlining the reason for the candidate's employment violation.

Harper has served as ambassador to the UN in New York. He has also served as permanent representative to the UN for Canada after serving in the office since 2011. In his nomination form, Harper acknowledged that he had made "significant mistakes" related to the handling of personal funds.

"The UN was supposed to have no business involving private dollars. I have apologized for this error and for causing pain to others," Harper said in the report.

Harper also told the Senate on Monday that "when I became ambassador to the UN in 2005, it was established that we would never again receive any money from the United Nations unless it was explicitly approved at the highest levels of the government of Canada."

Harper's confirmation process was delayed for several months so he could undergo a medical exam related to a pre-existing heart condition. Harper underwent the screening on November 30. He was unanimously approved by the Senate on January 15.

Harper later joined Ambassador-at-Large Ben Rhodes' team as the top political adviser and speechwriter for White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon when the two formed part of the so-called 'Reign of the Realists' within President George W. Bush's administration during the first months of the new administration.

Despite the rocky start, Harper later helped the White House create the political strategy framework to successfully push legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare during the Obama administration, as well as working

DARPA (DoD) wants to bring to life a system that would monitor and analyze a person's heart rate, breathing rate and gait to determine how long they have left in the world.

The agency, in a solicitation issued Monday, said the system would require an array of sensors to track a person's biometrics to see how the body responds to external stimuli and could be used on someone who has suffered brain injuries. It could also be used for medical care including the assessment of a stroke victim who could die from the illness without prompt treatment.

The system would be able to track a person's pulse and the rate of his heart rate while that person is still a living thing, which the solicitation says allows DARPA "to measure the health of a wounded warrior before, during, and after an organ transplant." It could also also be used to find out where soldiers are likely to be hit or to track their movements while on active duty.

The solicitation's description of the system suggests that DARPA is thinking not just about people with disabilities, but also those in the military who are wounded. It describes how current technology can be used to track the health of a soldier who has been wounded or, worse, killed. But the solicitation states:

When a soldier is wounded and unable to communicate, current technology cannot provide a reliable assessment of the physiological and psychological effects of a traumatic brain injury on the soldier. This is due to the complex interaction between a soldier's cognitive, physical and mental health. Therefore, DARPA is developing a neuroprosthetics system to enable a soldier to communicate without loss of conscious functions and with more clarity and accuracy. The system is capable of recording the soldier's pulse and the rate of his heart. Based on the soldier's behavioral and physiological data, it can use those data to monitor the soldier's brain activity, and thereby predict the soldiers' risk of brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), if present.

However, the solicitation doesn't say if the system used on wounded veterans would also provide the kind of data that the system could use for tracking injured civilians.

The agency has been working on systems like this for more than a decade, according to its 2013 annual report. But in recent years, its efforts to develop tools for detecting cyberthreats and combatting diseases such as depression has taken precedence, DARPA said in a blog post at the end of 2013. The agency said that DARPA has a "growing body of experience" in developing ways to quantify the effects of brain injury in combat veterans.

Do you think this kind of technology would benefit civilians? Sound off in the comments.

Image: DARPA<|endoftext|>(Reuters Health) - Most people with type 2 diabetes aren't getting the medication they need because of lack of insurance or a lack of funding to pay for medications, according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Diabetes Care.

The study's authors found that more than half of people in the United States with type 2 diabetes had no private insurance that covers insulin, the synthetic form of a hormone that regulates blood sugar, while 18 percent were living in states without Medicaid funding for treatment. While many people are eligible for coverage in employer-sponsored health plans, the study authors said a lack of access means many more people don't get the care they need for long periods of time.

"There aren't sufficient programs in place to cover diabetes adequately," said lead author R. Jeffrey Wright, an assistant professor with Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

A lack of treatment can cause higher, more frequent blood sugar levels, which can lead to long-term complications such as blindness, hearing loss and kidney problems, all of which are more common in people with diabetes than in the general population.

The study authors, however, caution that the findings are generalizable to people with type 2 diabetes and should not be used to suggest that people with the disease are not entitled to the same care that people without the disease get. In particular, the study authors said they want to emphasize that the findings need to be followed up with data on diabetes treatment in people with type 2 diabetes, which could change or narrow the study's findings if more people are treated.

Type 2 diabetes was first recognized in the 1950s as a disease related to obesity and has become more prevalent in the United States in recent decades thanks to high rates of obesity and weight gain among people with type 2 diabetes. In 2007, 31 percent of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes were obese, according to the U.S. government.

Insulin is used a standard insulin pump to take insulin in and deliver it to the cells in the body where it must be broken down into its components. The pump requires a prescription, but people can get a discount if they meet certain criteria, such as living at a low income or having a limited number of doctors who prescribe medication regularly.

The number of people displaced from their homes by Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip has risen to 3,071 with around 300 injured and 50 critically wounded according to information provided to the Al-Mezan Center for Human Rights under the protection of UN Security Council Resolution 2334.

It was previously reported that 963 Palestinian homes had been destroyed and over 1,000 seriously damaged by Israel's aggression on the Gaza Strip.

The Al-Mezan Center recently visited areas in Gaza where Israeli attacks are ongoing as an Israeli warplane fired several munitions against residential homes and residential areas on Tuesday 29 –31 October. The first report of injured people being treated at Gaza Hospital (Hospital of the Al-Nasser Hospital) came from the Al-Nasser Hospital when Al-Mezan received information that Israeli planes bombed a number of homes and residential areas in Rafah, Sheikh Radwan, Al-Shujaa and Al-Ras.

"Such brutal attacks on the civilian population demonstrate that the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip are not only being carried out with the aim of achieving the siege on the coastal region, but also with the aim of ending peaceful demonstrations and defending settlers' illegal activities on Palestinian land," said Hanan Ashrawi, Chairperson of the Palestinian National Initiative.

"This is a clear violation of the internationally recognized rules and regulations of armed conflict," she emphasized.

For her part, Hanan Ashrawi spoke of the need for urgent action by the international community to demand the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2382 (2009), which calls upon Israel to end its aggression against the Palestinian people. This resolution calls on Israel to stop all its military operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, including the expansion of the settlements and other aggressive operations which are aimed at the expansion and consolidation of Israel's hegemony in occupied Palestinian land and at the annexation of Jerusalem. The resolution also calls upon Israel to stop its aggression against Palestinian civilians.

During meetings with government officials in Washington, D.C., and Sweden, Hanan Ashrawi stressed that this is an international issue that requires international action.

"We call on the international community. The United Nations is in a strong position to intervene to stop that aggression in the most fundamental way and is the only forum that has the power to condemn this aggression and demand immediate and full compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law," she said.

Al-Mezan emphasizes, however, that the Palestinian leadership and the international community as well as the governments of the countries that finance Israeli warplanes in order to strengthen their political positions and to maintain their financial interests, are totally silent on the blatant violation of international humanitarian law perpetrated by Israel against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip. This is because these countries continue to support Israel's policies of aggression against the Gaza Strip. This in turn puts international humanitarian law, the safety of the civilians, the right to self-determination, the principle of non-intervention and the right of the Palestinian people to their own state, at risk.

The Al-Mezan Center also reported that as of Wednesday 31 October, the International Committee of the Red Cross had received information from the Gaza Strip of five killed and nine critically injured people since the beginning of the Israeli attacks on Gaza on 17 October. According to the ICRC in Jerusalem, the bodies of two of the five killed were recovered on the 31 October. It is also estimated that over 200 Palestinians have been killed and over 5,100 have sustained injuries since the beginning of the Israeli aggression, including dozens of children.<|endoftext|>1 Clean Ep. 615: The Story of the Diving Helmet On this episode, we take you inside the very first diving helmet, created by the Germans between 1916 and 1917.

======================================== SAMPLE 83 ========================================
You've found yourself staring down the barrel of a new project. It's a complex process, one you aren't quite sure how to tackle, a task that will be difficult to complete. So, don't panic, there are plenty of different ways to make a project, even if it is a very complex and time consuming one. In this article we'll look at the various styles of web design, what they all have to offer and how they can be applied to a project of your very own.

Aesthetic Style

Web design begins with a solid foundation, a site that's been designed with the basic principles of the web in mind. From there, it gradually becomes ever more abstract, focusing more and more on the visuals and content that is available, instead of the underlying framework of the design. It might be more obvious this style of design than others, having a design similar to the homepage of an agency or a brand, but many designers can apply this style to almost anything on the web.

It can work really well with text too, but there are a couple of things that always remain consistent with style such as typographical choices and colours, even if they're not particularly appealing. It's certainly the style that's most likely to attract internet trolls.

I think I can speak for everyone when I say I love how it makes you think about the way things look and feel, instead of their actual functionality. It's pretty amazing how something as important as design can make that much of a difference. It really does seem that all that matters when it comes to web design is how it looks, rather than what it does in actuality.

So, with a website designed with aesthetic styles in mind, let's examine what styles have to offer.

1. Aesthetic Style

First in our list of styles would be the aesthetic style which has many of the very same strengths as the previous aesthetic style. It will still be a good starting point and is well suited to most projects.

The aesthetic style also has a good sense of balance. It's not just a big blob of text with no visual cues to help it read. There are usually strong visual cues that can help you understand where you're heading, such as the use of bold, italic and underlining in headlines, the use of color, use of photos and so on. You can also apply many of these style tricks to pages, whether it be the header, footer, content or whatever you happen to be working on, which helps with readability.

2. Bright and Bold

Bright and bold are very similar to the aesthetic style in terms of aesthetics and are, very simply put, the style you'll need if you are designing something bright. It is very similar to the aesthetic style in that its primary focus is on design, but it doesn't rely purely on aesthetics to deliver a clear message. Instead, you will likely be using bright and bold for different purposes, such as making information more visual (such as creating headlines and text descriptions) or creating contrast with similar looking information (such as inlining the bold or italic text of the header or image of the sidebar).

It seems likely that it is more popular amongst freelancers. It is fairly simple and easy to get started with, so if you really enjoy designing websites with bright and bold typography, you should definitely give it a shot.

3. Emphasizing Text

Text is very much a crucial element in a lot of modern design. With a large content collection, you are always going to need more than one way to communicate it. A good design that is clear, compelling and effective means the right message needs to be communicated and conveyed in as few characters as possible. Emphasizing text definitely fits this bill. In design theory, it is referred to as a hierarchy of elements, and is defined as the arrangement and combination of the following elements:

A title. The most important element, it is always first and gives a lot of information.

Headers. Headers should contain the most important information, such as the title.

Images. Images can often also be useful, as they have a way of displaying important information without needing extra text.

Inline, or bold, text. If you want to make emphasis a bit more obvious, you can use bold text around it.

4. Use Typography to Improve Information Design

Typography can be defined in many different ways depending on the designer, but it basically refers to the design of typefaces in particular. It will generally involve designing with a particular typeface or using one, especially the sans serif typefaces, in a particular way.

One of the best ways to use typography has been illustrated by the designers behind Slice, a website that used typefaces to deliver information much better than a lot of web designers used in the past, such as the dreaded Google Search page. The Slice site was great in terms

Rice University researchers have developed a way to track individual genes using a small device that can be implanted in the body and transmit genetic information wirelessly.

The chip works like a tiny wireless transmitter, sending signals between cell and DNA at a rate of 100 million signals per second. The information can be analyzed in real time to provide the opportunity to learn more about the human genome.

"This is a real breakthrough for the future of bioinformatics, because it's the ability to analyze the genome with unprecedented speed and accuracy," said James Rothman, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and co-author of the study published in the journal Current Biology.

The data the chip receives is translated into a form that can be displayed on a screen, allowing patients to monitor their gene activity within minutes. In contrast, it typically takes up to one month for a blood test to get back a complete report of genetic activity, even when a sample is taken within 24 hours of an illness's manifestation.

Because the sensor is small, it is easy to implant and can be surgically implanted into the body. It also does not require external power for data transmission, thus reducing the need for batteries and power cords, according to the researchers.

Currently the chip works with human DNA, but can be easily adapted to work with other types of genetic material. That capability would potentially be especially helpful to medical researchers studying the genetics of different diseases.

Rothman co-authored the paper with Yi Chen, a Rice research associate in the Department of electrical engineering and computer science; Mingming Xu and Yuan Wu, both currently at the University of California, Berkeley; and Xiaolin Yang, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.

In 2011, the National Science Foundation supported the research, which was a collaboration between researchers at Rice; UC Berkeley; UC San Francisco; Columbia University; the University of Pennsylvania, and University of Cambridge - Britain.<|endoftext|>For some time now, I've been searching for a product or service that will enable me to build a custom, high-performance, open architecture in the cloud at scale and for a fraction of the cost of the other options. I've spent many days researching different solutions, but all have come up short.

Today, I'm sharing a new product that I think is the perfect solution for this particular problem. Built in a month by a small startup out of Australia, with a small team, their technology allows developers to build cloud applications in a way that is both efficient and scalable with the least amount of effort.

I've been using the technology for the last six weeks. As you'll see from the video above, the application is currently being used at my company, The Humble Bundle to deliver a product line of products. My team is running it at a few hundred apps and games and so far we've been able to deliver high performance and a stable, high scalability infrastructure. Our application runs on three high-end Amazon EC2 instances, each with 40 Core i7 processors and 8TB of RAM. I've never had so much computing power to work with in a single instance before.

One of the challenges in open architecture is that it's tough to have many instances of the same component in multiple datacenters in two or more countries. In the past, we've used an IBM NSX controller in multiple instances. We've had it for 4 or 5 years, and have grown accustomed to the amount of effort required to manage multiple clusters. We found that we were losing compute time and power in these environments, which was costing us tens of thousands of dollars a month.

Using an open architecture with three open EC2 instances requires the application to be able to scale out across three datacenters, or a cluster, in less than 10 minutes. If the cluster size is too high, then you have a problem, so scaling out to a single node means that when you have to make the switch to this new cluster (for example, because of a failover), you are stuck for six hours, which is also bad.

The solution I ended up settling on is similar to OpenStack and it works really well and is a huge relief from having to constantly monitor and manage several nodes running several instances.

Here's the product from the Australian company.

There's much more about the technology in the video than I'm allowed to discuss at the moment. It's a very compelling product, and I highly recommend you watch it:

If they ever launch it commercially, the cost would be incredibly small for developers (or anyone planning on building a cloud application).<|endoftext|>A man was arrested Friday on suspicion of setting fire to at least five cars

"The problem is that we now live in a country where a majority thinks that the government can do whatever they want. That has never been our country. Our Founders' principles are the best way to run a country." – President Barack Obama

"Our national security structure depends on the loyalty of our people, especially those who defend America: Our men and women in uniform. That loyalty is what keeps America safe. Without that, we'd have no national security or safety protections like FISA, Patriot Act, etc … Without trust at the top, everything else falls apart." – James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence

"We must know what we know. But to the world at large, we do not." – Barack Obama

"If this war were a man, this commander would be a woman and not a man." – Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of US forces in Afghanistan

"The more we're forced to confront the fact that these [terrorist groups] have been here in our country forever … the more they've become like us. Like us, in their minds, with their history, their culture, their economy. And that's a very, very difficult thing to get at." – President Barack Obama, in a 2011 address on US strategies in the Middle East

"[N]ot long after the American flag was raised, a bunch of guys dressed in the uniforms of our military went marching in a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. In the cold, rain, sleet and mist that turned the day into a day of mourning." – President Barack Obama

"We will not give up our values or our freedoms until you give up your fear." – President Obama, September 2013

"The last enemy the United States of America faces is not Al Qaeda and its associated forces. It is a terrorist network that has killed and wounded thousands of innocent people. It must be defeated, wherever it exists." – Joint Chiefs of Staff, April 2010

"[A U.S.] counterterrorism strategy requires a persistent effort against al Qaeda and its affiliates. But a strategic mindset is not sufficient by itself." – President Obama, 2010 speech

"For years, we have tried to make sense of the contradictions inherent to our war on terrorism. Some critics of U.S. policies have argued that we are waging a war against Islam, and that the war is based on religious faith. But the reality is that our war against terror begins with the reality of 9/11. That's why I believe we have to admit, in a national dialogue, the fundamental truth – our war is not a war against Islam, but a war against violent extremism." – President Barack Obama, January 2011

"We cannot and should not allow the promotion of a false choice between our security and our values." – President Barack Obama, May 2010

"This president is not the commander in chief of this military. This president is just the commander in chief of this military. He is accountable for what he does in the military. I am accountable for what I tell all of my men and women in uniform, when they get out on the battlefield." – Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

"Those who would sacrifice our civil liberties in the name of safety, would have sacrificed this country years ago." – President Barack Obama, 2011 speech in Cairo, Egypt

"We will not abandon our principles, or waver in our quest to combat terrorism abroad, or to protect our society from new terrorists the way we used to do it at home." – President Barack Obama, May 2010

These sentiments have been echoed by Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives, notably Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN)

"It is not time to give up the fundamental values that make this country the greatest in the world." – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)

"To the leaders in [Iran], you have a fundamental choice to make. They could make the right decision by ending their support for terrorism, recognizing the rights of all people in this world, rejecting intimidation and isolation, and by living up to their obligations as signatories to this deal. Or, they could continue on their path to an ever-growing nuclear weapons capability. This deal is not good for Iran. It is not good for the United States and I hope that their leaders understand that and make the right decision soon." – Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), letter to Iran's leaders, July 2015

"We as a nation will always do what we need to do to defend ourselves, but you shouldn't do what you need to do to defend us if you are not in this country legally." – U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), to Mexican drug cartels

In the United States, however, most people appear to be willing to suspend most of the core democratic principles upon which this country was founded.

The video of the woman on the bus is now a viral sensation. Her actions, taken in her own words on video, have raised awareness for child sexual abuse and spurred discussion for sexual assault prevention.

According to officials with the Winnipeg Police Service, the woman was a passenger on a northbound bus on Friday morning when she noticed a man masturbating behind the doors.

The woman boarded the bus at approximately 9:20 a.m. and took a seat near the back. The woman says the door between the two seats is open and anyone could have walked in.

A woman got up and looked behind the seats and observed a man leaning on one of the seats with his crotch exposed, while masturbating. (Winnipeg Police Service) The woman got up and looked behind the seats in front of her and observed a man leaning on one of the seats with his groin exposed, while masturbating.

When the bus arrived at the corner of Victoria Avenue and Pembina Highway, the woman attempted to leave but she was refused service. Police say a video that came to light Monday shows the woman asking why she wasn't being served.

Police say no charges have been laid in connection with the incident that day.

'Not okay.'<|endoftext|>Derek Jeter is in discussions to coach the American junior team for the World Baseball Classic, an informal announcement the Yankees confirmed today. Jeter has not yet accepted but is expected to do so shortly.

The Yankees have not officially announced the selection of Jeter for the team but have confirmed that he has had a series of conversations with team officials.

"We've had some very preliminary talks with Derek," A.J. Burnett said today. "It would be great if we got some of those done today -- probably before we head out to camp. We'll see what happens. Obviously, he would be an exceptional coach and he would fit perfectly with a team like we have here."

Burnett said he spoke with John Farrell earlier today and discussed the possibility of being the manager of Jeter's team. Farrell is now considered a front-runner to be the manager of the American team.

The American team, which will be announced in May, will participate in the WBC in March.

Burnett said the only current Yankees coaches with experience coaching the National team are the current bench coach Joe Girardi and the manager Joe Girardi.

"I think the question is whether Derek will actually accept [being the manager]," Burnett said.

Jeter told Burnett over the phones that he likes the idea of coaching.

On Friday, Burnett was in New York to attend Jeter's annual game with the New York Yankees against the Red Sox. When Burnett arrived to the airport, he says his cell phone ran dead so he went to the airport. He says Jeter called him from the airport and told him to come on over and have a seat.

"Derek was calling me and said, 'I would love to talk to you,' " Burnett said.

[Also: MLB Network to stream MLB playoffs games]

In 2005, Jeter was named manager of the national team in the first WBC, which he managed. He has coached and coached well at the MLB level, including leading the Yankees to the division title in 2010 by winning 12 of the first 15 games of the season.

A native of Jamaica, Jeter is a native of the Bronx and owns a professional baseball player's image.

[Also: Yankees' David Robertson signs extension with the Astros]

There is speculation that the Yankees might select another Major League Baseball player: catcher Jorge Posada.

Posada will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season so will have a window for teams to sign him.

"Jays" are the team name the Yankees have adopted since 2007 and are their "official mascot," according to the team's site.

The team's official Web site reads:

The "Jays" logo is a logo inspired by the famous "Jays' Ball" logo used by the St. Louis Cardinals during their first Major League season in 1905, and its trademarked by Major League Baseball.

Originally, the baseball team that would one day become the New York Yankees was the "Washington Senators" which was formed in Boston in 1909, playing in the American Association. In 1910, it became the original Senators, becoming the first American professional team to adopt a "home field" moniker.

In 1933, the Washington Senators moved to Boston, where they played until 1948, when Boston had to move its team due to stadium construction. In the late 1940s, the league merged with the American League and by the end of 1951 had renamed itself the American League West, creating the division of the Texas Rangers and the Oakland Athletics in 1967.

The Rangers moved to Texas in 2012, as did the Athletics (as well as the team in

The US is considering sending an additional 2,000 troops to Afghanistan as part of a force build-up, US military commanders have confirmed in the wake of the Taliban's recent resurgence.

General John Nicholson, the senior commander of the US-led force in Afghanistan, said that an additional 1,000 or so troops could be sent in support of the Afghan security forces.

"What we are doing now is to look at, we have all options on the table. We have no preference," Nicholson told reporters yesterday in London.

The move comes after the Taliban have gained ground in several provinces across the country in recent weeks, having previously been unable to challenge the Afghan armed forces in significant areas.

According to a BBC report, the Taliban has now captured more ground in the northern province of Kunduz and has gained ground in the south, especially in Helmand province.

Speaking at the Nato Summit in Brussels, Nicholson said: "As we move from the drawdown of US forces into a position where we are looking at the possibility of an increase of troops that the president has said we could do, we are talking about the ability to go into a location to support Afghan security forces – but how much more can we do and how much more are going to be possible is something that we have to think about."

According to the report, the US and the British are weighing the possibility of sending in a total of approximately 3,000 or 4,000 troops to Afghanistan. At present, the US-led forces control around 13,000 troops in Afghanistan.

The general went on to say that while such a troop increase is being discussed, "the president has not committed to any particular number of additional troops".

However, the presence of even a smaller number of troops is seen by some in the US as the next logical step in Washington's planned draw down.

It was reported in November that the White House's plans for an additional 3,000 US troops for Afghanistan would see "around 400" of those troops be sent into Helmand, which is a key battleground in the country's civil war.

In a speech on Sunday, President Donald Trump outlined plans to add another 10,000 troops to the US forces in Afghanistan.

Trump said the US would not "wait" but would "fight to win" in Afghanistan. During the speech at Fort Myer, Virginia, he also repeated his position that the US will continue providing "condescending" support in the form of air strikes and other support, in the fight against Islamic State.

The US military previously deployed between 25,000 and 35,000 troops to Afghanistan from 2002 to early 2015. Around 8,400 troops are still in Afghanistan as of February 2017. Nicholson said that the US would be open to discussing the future US level of support for Afghan security forces.

During his remarks on Sunday, Trump stressed that "we are going to keep going to Afghanistan, but we're going to win."

The US commander has previously confirmed that the US will continue to increase its troop levels, with a proposed increase of 8,400 troops coming to the table to discuss. This would not go ahead despite Trump's pledge to the NATO summit.<|endoftext|>The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.

If we know anything about the history of the American West, we can say this: the frontier was often the great equalizer of races and peoples.

In the first decades of the American republic, the idea of racial equality was rejected by the government of the United States as immoral, dangerous, illegitimate, and unworthy of existence, while slavery prevailed in the South.

In 1796, John Adams stated bluntly that: "In the opinion of the vast majority of mankind, the Negro race is immeasurably inferior to the Caucasian."

While the United States did not become a multi-racial society by the act of national will and legislation, the attitudes of the colonial governors and agents, whether they were loyal colonists or not, are evidence of a prevailing and growing sentiment that saw and saw fit to see blacks as subhuman. In fact, as long as the nation existed, it was more likely that blacks would be enslaved in the North than in the South.

What kind of place was the American West?

The Western frontier was a frontier of sorts for the United States, and it differed from every other place in its geography, climate, resources, and the social conditions to which it held its inhabitants.

The American Frontier

In the late 18th Century, most people could not have imagined that a population of Europeans would one day live beyond the boundaries of New England. Indeed, even at the time of the first settlement of this continent by Europeans, it was widely perceived that these people were barbarians.

The earliest maps of the region showed no visible trace of the great river system that we all know, and few Europeans imagined

The wall in Nanhu, China in the central province of Hunan, is a 1.2 km-high (0.91 miles - 0.4 miles) wall made of volcanic rock that rises more than one kilometer above its ground. The wall has stood for thousands of years, and some parts have eroded completely away.

The wall was built by workers who had to dig through mud and rocks. Some walls in the area still contain traces of the construction, including the rock wall in front of the Nanhu Palace, which can be seen today.

To make the wall, workers dug through a mountain of mud at high temperatures and pressure, creating a layer of volcanic rock on top of the mud, which made for a tough and very slippery rock surface. Then, workers brought in heavy machinery and put a lid over the whole construction to keep sand and mud out of the construction site.

In total, 1.22 km-high wall was built, and its walls stand at over 10 meters high. The Nanhu Wall has been standing since the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220) and was used for many centuries, but no one knows the exact dates of when it was built first.

Experts had thought that the wall must have been built by workers on site for millennia, since the wall is still there today. The wall is not as impressive as the Great Wall of China, which is a nearly 2.8 km (1.8 miles - 1/4 mile) high structure constructed using limestone.

The Great Wall of China has stood for more than four thousand years and now has an incredible population of over 700,000. The Nanhu Wall is less impressive when it comes to its height, since it stands around two kilometers. However, it offers tourists a spectacular view for a few hours and is probably still better as an attraction than the Great Wall.<|endoftext|>The city has a unique reputation as one of the most racially diverse cities in the nation, ranking No. 3 overall for white population, No. 3 for Asian residents, No. 4 for Hispanic residents and No. 1 for black residents. But now some residents are speaking out about a lack of safety problems.

"We're getting the same old routine with officers," said Deidre Walker, a 37-year-old black mother who lives on Longwood Terrace. She was referring to calls from officers who she and her children have had with residents.

Walker was one of the protesters during the "Day Without a Woman" protests that started Tuesday, in which about 250 women called for an end to discrimination against women in the workplace and in the family court system.

"We know that there are a lot of black kids that are getting bullied because they're black, and they have to go to schools where they're getting harassed by some kids who look like them," Walker said.

The protests came a day after a police officer shot a dog in East Baltimore, killing it. Officers who responded to the incident said the dog had jumped on the car of Officer William Porter, 32, who was inside trying to help the man in the car.

A spokeswoman for the police department said the circumstances of the shooting were under investigation by the state attorney's office.

The department also is investigating reports that police in West Baltimore arrested the wrong man at least four times in the past two weeks, according to news accounts. Police records show officers made arrests in seven of those cases on Monday, according to news reports. Three of the arrests were in the 8th District, between North and Pennsylvania avenues.

City residents say the department has not improved its response to violence in the city, particularly the killings of black men by police officers over the past two years and a rising pace of shootings and robberies. They also complain that the department is not doing enough to stop violence in neighborhoods where they live.

"It's been an ongoing and worsening problem," said Walker, whose family moved from Alabama into an apartment complex in East Baltimore two years ago.

Walker said she has been called by officers a number of times in recent months or weeks, but the calls have become more frequent after the killing of Terrell "Woody" Johnson.

Lets say that there are 2 people in a relationship. One of them works and is making more than the other one. Which one of them goes to the bank and asks for his money?

I would personally say that the person with the greater net worth should ask first in order to prove to her friend that he really does want to pay off his debt.

It's almost a double standard. I would never feel that a woman who is just out of a job feels the need to ask her male friend for money. We would rather pay off our debt and save our future.

Well, maybe I can see her point.

And you should not be asking her friend for money either, you should just go ahead and pay off the debt yourself and save yourself the burden of having to pay off her friend's debt too.<|endoftext|>A new report shows the gap between rich and poor in Canada had narrowed for the first time in nearly eight years in the first quarter of 2012, Statistics Canada said Friday.

The agency also said the percentage of Canada's population that earns more than $100,000 a year fell to a post-recession low in 2012.

The agency said its estimates, based on new data from Statistics Canada, show there were 3.2 million households in Ontario with average debt loads of more than $150,000 in January, up 23 per cent from 2008.

"Despite the overall decline in overall debt levels, households in the top-third of the income distribution saw their wealth increase," the report says.

The trend is in addition to the trend seen in the United States and Europe, the agency said.

The report's authors were unable to say if the trend reflects a decline in poverty, or is linked both to the recession's financial pressures and to rising incomes due to the gains in housing prices.

Budget 2008 set a goal of reducing the country's debt-to-gross national income ratio to 35 per cent by 2015, which is now at 30.7 per cent. At that debt-to-gross national income ratio, total debt equals gross domestic product.

The report also cites the economic rebound from 2008 to 2009 and the 2008-09 global financial crisis as causes of the change.

There is also good news for Canadians who want to retire earlier.<|endoftext|>The first time I tried to install Windows 10 Insider Preview, I was greeted by a message telling me I was a developer on a special build that didn't allow my normal "normal" settings. After that, every time I tried, I was warned that some kind of patch is coming to bring my PC, or computer, into the Windows 10 "mature" stage.

I thought, this is some kind of scam. But since I am a Windows fan and user, it didn't bother me very much; Microsoft doesn't give up its customers easily.

Windows 10 Insider Preview for PC and Mobile is a preview build for Windows 10, to get a sneak peek and try out new things that won't be the main focus of the official Windows 10 release.

I was lucky, though, because when my PC arrived in a nice blue box, with a pre-loaded version of Windows 10, I immediately installed Windows Insider Preview for PC and Mobile. I can only hope that the same will happen with the next version of Windows.

So here we go, then: Microsoft is rolling out new build number 16199 of Windows 10 Enterprise for desktop and Mobile. And this time, it will include a lot of bug fixes and some improvements.

To see Windows 10 build 16199 for PC and Mobile, click on this link.

We'll start with the basics. As we said when previewing build 14926 in December 2015, the biggest change with Windows 10 Enterprise is that it won't be a full Windows 10 release. Instead, Windows Server 2016 will be the main release. But this time, not only Desktop users will have Windows Server, Mobile and IoT are getting Windows 10 Enterprise too.

As of today, Windows 10 Enterprise build 16199 does not include any significant changes. That means it is essentially a version of Windows 10 for Enterprise users; it hasn't been updated since Windows 10 SP1 was released in July 2015. What does it contain, though?

New Windows 10 features

Windows 10 has four major categories of features:

Windows 10 Mobile features like mobile messaging, calendar, apps or games.

Windows Phone 10 features like the phone interface and apps.

Windows 10 IoT features like the Microsoft Edge browser and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Windows 10 PC features like the start menu and taskbar, and the Control Panel.

What else makes up this book?

The book is not an omnibus edition. Everything is published in its entirety so you can go back and read the stories yourself!

You'll also love the book for the unique, bespoke bookmark. Unlike most of the other book-binding designs we've seen, it actually works as a bookmark.

It's designed with the spine facing down which keeps the paper and book in place whilst it folds back. But on close inspection, it looks like the pages have been folded, and the book has been flipped over to reveal a new layout.

And of course, the best part about the bookmark is the bookmark's unique, and very pretty, design.

Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone who loves stories, and also anyone who loves reading about how stories come to be.

Everyone can relate to one or more of the stories in 'No-Sleepers', from the writer who finds himself trapped in the mysterious land of the no-so-sleepers, to the author who finds himself a little bit too busy to write much. It's no secret that reading a good story is important and it's great to have a collection of stories you can share with your friends, family and even colleagues, in case you fall asleep at work, or accidentally catch the bus and spend all night on the road, instead of working. It's also nice to have stories that you love to read.

'No-Sleepers' is for everyone, so if you're not sure if you'd make good story-tellers, don't hesitate to add a story or two to your 'No-Sleepers' collection (if you're willing!), but

The government is "in denial" about the impact of its austerity measures and will "have no answers" to people suffering, the new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has warned.

McDonnell, who has not been an MP or minister in the Labour party since 2011, said the party cannot "justify" cuts in the public sector while still borrowing, and said the coalition government is in "deep denial".

He used a speech at Britain's first National Federation of Labour Counselling Service conference in London to accuse May of playing "ideologically weak". He also called for more local democracy, including direct elections for local councillors, and more direct democratic involvement in policy-making.

McDonnell's remarks come in the wake of the publication of a report on the government's austerity programme by Martin Lewis, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. It revealed that spending cuts have hit public services and the poor the hardest, and will increase poverty by £12bn over three years.

McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, who resigned in July 2011 as an adviser to Ed Miliband, who he supported in the leadership race of the party, has now become one of the strongest voices on the opposition side of Parliament. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is not expected to take any further part in the shadow cabinet when Corbyn attends the conference later this week.

In his speech last night, McDonnell, who was elected to the shadow cabinet last year and is due to replace the shadow health secretary, Heidi Alexander, as shadow work and pensions secretary when the shadow cabinet reorganises next month, said the Labour party was "not a monolithic block" of supporters and he had a "long way to go" to reach out to people who had been disillusioned by the 2010 election.

He said: "Labour is not just a Labour party. It is a broad church. Many of those that voted for us in 2010 are disappointed and alienated. They feel left behind, like they've been forgotten and have been sidelined by the leadership and the right wing of the party. "Our challenge is to reach out to people and let them know what Labour has to offer." In a sign of a potential softening of the party's approach, McDonnell said he would back increasing the minimum wage from £6.50 to £7.50 by 2020 and pledged to scrap tuition fees at universities. He also called for councils to be given greater power to take control of local services.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest John McDonnell to join Labour conference: 'I am a socialist politician.'

Speaking after McDonnell's speech, former minister Barbara Keeley said: "The shadow chancellor is a brilliant person who, if he's elected, will be a brilliant shadow chancellor. He has the potential to be a good leader of the party.

"What he needs to do is learn from the mistakes he made 10 years ago when he was in shadow chancellor, which is to go back to basics and bring back the roots of what Labour represents: social justice, tackling poverty and inequality."

McDonnell said the Labour party needed to return to its roots, and that people had voted for the party under Ed Miliband in part because they wanted to see welfare cut, tax rises limited to the wealthiest, and an end to austerity.

"In that sense, the Tories' cuts and austerity are a massive disappointment to the British public, who wanted a better politics. This government and its friends are in denial about what has happened. It is in denial about the damage it has caused to people's lives," says John McDonnell. "I feel for my friend and colleague [the Scottish first minister] Alex Salmond. He campaigned for an independence referendum and he hasn't got a referendum because of the Tory budget." McDonnell said that the Conservatives and "the establishment media" were in denial about what they had done to the British people.

"The government can deny the damage it has done by playing games while it says to its people: 'Trust us'," he said. "I am in denial about what the Tory government has done to the British people. That's the reason I joined the Labour party."

He said that people were now disillusioned, and said this could "turn into an electoral crisis in next year's general election as people lose faith in a politics that offers anything substantial".


I can't see what Labour can do while it is in this deep denial. John McDonnell

"People are losing faith in politics because they don't believe that anything is being done to help them. People look at the world and they see austerity as the only option. This government is in denial. The party is in denial."

He said austerity was not just an economic issue but also a "cultural and moral" one.

Labour could regain the trust of the public only if the party abandoned the approach adopted by the coalition, McDonnell said, and stopped playing a "politics of fear" by promising to make cuts of up to 18% in public

In a new video, the founder of the #DefendRisingSun movement explains why he is taking matters into his own hands. (Published March 29, 2017)

The #DefendRisingSun group says it's only making its first phone call to Washington, D.C. this week, with the mission of raising the flag of the United States on the South Carolina Statehouse after the racially-charged shooting of nine parishioners at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.

It's unclear who founded #DefendRisingSun, but it appears to have been started in the early afternoon Wednesday by a man claiming to be a former U.S. Marine and the owner of a small business.

The video is a 30-minute, mostly-audience statement that's punctuated with moments of music and action, and begins with a short disclaimer: "I'm not a real activist. I have a job."


But it's not that the man behind the microphone isn't an activist. As a military veteran, who served two tours in Afghanistan, that fact is clear. He says the shooting on Wednesday left him "hurt" and "very angry."

"I got a lot of anger in me, because this nation is still healing," he says in the video.

"The shooting that was just today at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church -- the man's an American hero. He did right by his race. He took bullets for his race, and his gender," he continued. "But in the name of God, I'm going to shoot back and I'm going to send it to where it comes from."

Dylann Roof is said to have taken down the Confederate battle flag in front of the historic church. Police say he killed nine people inside the church.

What the video does not mention is that Roof had no affiliation, and no apparent ties to, the group behind #DefendRisingSun.

Still, even as #DefendRisingSun members and supporters have gathered and been filmed in the streets of Charleston and across the country, one thing is certain: The shooter's actions were not inspired by the group's message.

"We need to be careful not to try to attribute this crime to something political and not to try to attribute this crime to something criminal and not to try to point fingers," President Obama said at a White House press conference Monday night. "And we need to remember what happened in the past is never an excuse for what happened in the future."

Roof, who was already the suspected shooter in the slayings of a churchgoing couple and parishioner at Emanuel AME Church before Wednesday's killing spree, later took his own life.

In his video, he makes it clear no one else will be responsible for the flag-raising on the South Carolina Statehouse lawn.

"I'm going to be a voice for justice of the church. My voice is for justice of the people who were killed. My voice is for justice of justice of people who were hurt. But it's been done by a single individual. We've seen what he did. I've seen where it comes from," he says.

"He killed nine of his own brothers in the church, and he's gonna kill somebody else in the morning to cover everything up. ... My anger is for the victims of that church," he continues. "They didn't deserve to die; they deserved to go home."

He went on to say "I had the chance to kill somebody and kill somebody, and the only way I can kill somebody is to put a bullet in their head."

As #DefendRisingSun rallies to raise the flag at the Statehouse, it stands to do just that.<|endoftext|>About 20 years ago, the Supreme Court began an unwritten effort to make judges more independent, but a court that has always been heavily influenced by a small, powerful bloc of dissenters has been harder to change than many people thought.

The Supreme Court may not have made any real political impact in the past three decades but it has certainly made an impact on the political process. What are known as partisan gerrymandering cases could have a dramatic impact on future presidential races.

The Republican-dominated court has been divided 4-4 in a series of rulings, including the 2010 McCutcheon v. FEC case that dramatically reduced campaign contribution limits. In 2013, the court agreed to hear the case brought by Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker. This time the court could split along ideological lines once again to decide how to curb the abuses of wealthy individuals in a way that's favorable to most states. There's a chance this case could also create a real constitutional crisis, as partisan gerrymandering is the only kind that the Supreme Court has agreed to weigh in on.

It might seem crazy that partisan gerrymandering has become a hot topic these days. After

An explosion at a truckload of ammonium nitrate, the chemical necessary to make explosives, killed 30 people Friday in New Jersey, leaving authorities scrambling to figure out how the explosives traveled in a truck.

Investigators didn't immediately know if the incident was related to terrorism.

A truck bomb in New Jersey left 30 dead and 150 injured, officials said.

The FBI said explosives experts from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives responded to the scene following the explosion around 7:30 p.m. in an industrial park, about 70 minutes from Philadelphia. The area is home to a number of trucking and distribution companies, and nearby schools were reportedly placed on lockdown in a safety precaution.

Gov. Chris Christie tweeted that no one had died in the blast, which he said was similar to an incident that occurred in 2013 in Ohio:

No deaths were initially reported on scene, New Jersey Gov says. Authorities will continue to investigate. — Christie FoxNews (@ChristieFoxNews) September 19, 2016

A massive investigation has turned up virtually nothing to indicate the culprit had links to international or domestic terrorism, officials said. In fact, some officials theorized that the ammonium nitrate might have been intentionally planted in the area by a disgruntled former employee, reports CBS News' John Blackstone.

While authorities don't necessarily consider the incident to be an act of terror, they have taken it seriously for the past week and warned nearby communities of a possible terrorist threat, Blackstone reported.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also told CBS News' John Blackstone that there were no immediate claims.

"It's a real puzzling circumstance. There are no obvious connections to international terrorism," Christie said.

Gov. Chris Christie tells @CBSNews no one is dead, but there is "very suspicious activity" in a truck explosion in New Jersey https://t.co/0KrDyTkZyj pic.twitter.com/2m1Rwv0y0K — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 19, 2016 @GovChristie: There is very suspicious activity in a truck that exploded in #NewJersey pic.twitter.com/Wb1H2L5Yj9 — CBS News (@CBSNews) September 19, 2016

The incident happened in a truck stop parking lot.

New Jersey State police troopers rushed to the scene and secured a perimeter around the plant, reports CBS Philly.

"They found an extremely significant fire," Police Superintendent Lt. Paul Azzopardi, from the New Jersey State Police, said during a news conference.

The fertilizer was stored in the back of a large tractor trailer, the New Jersey Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services said in a statement.

A man has been arrested, but he was not a suspect in the explosion or the fire, officials said. The man has been charged with unlawful distribution of a detonating device causing bodily harm, Assemblyman Declan O'Scanlon, who is a fire chief from Trenton, told CBS News.

"Our focus now is to ensure the safety of our residents and first responders," said O'Scanlon.

Investigators are looking for more information so they know what exploded, the New York Times reported.

As the investigation continues, there have been calls for action in the wake of the explosion.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ, issued a statement Friday calling the explosion a "terrible tragedy" and the most devastating terrorism attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.

"The terrorist threat has evolved over the past several years, and the threat from home-grown terrorists is now as serious as the threat from international terrorists," Booker said in the statement. "In light of this, President Obama's decision to bypass Congress to use a piece of legislation that would increase authority for the security services, and the failure to address our nation's immigration crisis, I have come out strongly against this reckless and dangerous action."

"Congress must not give up the vital oversight responsibility that has long been an essential aspect of our democracy," he added.

"We must have robust security programs that recognize the terrorist threat, but that also do not hinder our basic freedoms. We cannot have an American policy based on the assumption that terrorists will not attack our homeland."

Sen. Rand Paul, R-KY, also tweeted a statement Friday:

Just spoke to Sen. Bob Menendez. I told him I am extremely pleased he was able to get the truckers bill, and to support it. pic.twitter.com/1zfYn6dDd4 — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) September 19, 2016

Paul also praised state and federal authorities.

"I've spoken to the New York State Police and I've spoken to the FBI and they've assured me there's no connection," he said of the

The Department of Transportation says drivers are being hit with an average of two new distracted driving tickets a day in 2014. There have been several high-profile high-profile cases recently.

Police in Toronto charged three men after they were caught with a Jeep stuck in a canal in November, and a distracted driver in New Zealand was fined nearly $50,000 in 2012 for leaving his vehicle on tracks after hitting a pedestrian.

The New York Times reported yesterday on several distracted drivers involved in crash-related emergencies.

A pedestrian was hit by a Lexus travelling at about 100 km/h. The driver of the Lexus, in the left lane of a highway, failed to take evasive action and struck the pedestrian; he died. A female pedestrian was hit from behind and died hours later.

In Quebec, a driver was fined $1,000 and a passenger in a car that was rear-ended for failure to take evasive action to avoid a collision.

In New York, a driver was fined $300 for failing to apply the brakes in the event of a rear-end accident, while a driver's hand was left inside a purse on an interstate highway.

And it should be made clear that not every distracted driving violation is a hit and run.

The Transportation Act makes it compulsory for every taxi driver, taxi dispatcher, chauffeur, limo driver and vehicle-for-hire driver to be trained in the safe use of hand-operated mobile phones and wireless devices for calling and texting, and for the same device to be available in the vehicle if one is not already carrying it.

The Transportation Act also specifies the regulations for driver training, and gives the Minister of Transport the mandate to conduct and supervise a driver training course in relation to distracted driving.

The current legislation makes a driver who fails to comply with a safe use instruction must pay the owner, lessee, or driver of the car the maximum fine permitted under the law, plus penalties assessed by the driver training program at $6 for a second failure, $8 for a third, $12 for a fourth, and $18 for a fifth or subsequent.

The Transportation Act requires each driver to record on his or her driver's licence any instruction given that was not followed.

And the Transportation Act requires drivers to obtain, at a training centre where available, one hour of supervised safe use instruction for both the vehicle and the driver.

The law also requires that the training program must be developed and operated by an entity approved by the Minister of Transportation.<|endoftext|>We are very happy to announce that we have reached an agreement with our new sponsors.

(CNNMoney) I've never been afraid to get my hands dirty. In fact, I was never particularly comfortable before I was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. With my cancer diagnosis, I took it as my mission to try everything to stay alive.

At least a couple of times a week I went out into the field, dug a hole, hauled in a bucket, emptied and recirculated it, then put my hand in the bucket. I had the power to affect change if I worked at it.

Yet there was one thing that I'd never tried to do that could have a dramatic impact on the spread of your cancer - and that was to stop taking the prescribed medication for your asthma.

Because by not taking your routine medication, you can worsen your lung cancer and even make it more aggressive.

I have had some bad experiences with drug companies trying to sell the asthma medication I'm supposed to take, and not surprisingly, the companies and the drug companies have been fighting me to the court of public opinion for my decision to not be prescribed the drug.

In the years before my diagnosis, I was prescribed this medication to help me cope with the constant attacks of acute asthma that I suffered.

My doctor never really talked to me about it, but it was clear that the only reason I got this medication to help me deal with my asthma was because of the lung cancer warning my doctor issued me. They wanted me to take more of their medicine when it was prescribed. In reality, I'm on far less than what is prescribed.

But the companies wanted me to be on every bottle.

So in 2013 that I learned my condition had reached stage four cancer, I had to talk to my doctor, ask him to give me the option to stop taking the medication because he wasn't sure why I was receiving all this extra medicine to tackle the condition. The physician was not too thrilled about it either because he said it could increase my risk of liver damage.

I was on the medication and on it, every day, but I knew it wasn't making my asthma less bad. In fact, when doctors see an increased risk for lung cancer, they prescribe you a more aggressive cancer medicine.

The pharmaceutical company gave me a list of everything that was in my medicine bag, and as he had said when I told him about stage four lung cancer, every single time I opened the medicine bag a number of different drugs showed up. But in reality, the medicine bag was already full.

I didn't want to go back to my old system, though, and for a few years I experimented with the asthma medicine instead of taking it daily.

At first, it wasn't too bad. Most days, I'd find a way to live without the medication for an hour or so. But when I stopped taking it for a certain amount of time, it started to get really bad.

I'd feel the same symptoms again, and I had to start walking back to my car again and then take a cab. I started taking a ride at least once a day. And it was getting even tougher. The side effects had started to appear, the doctor didn't know how to tell me what medications to take or how to check them out, and I wouldn't be able to drive again.

With time I learned to live just two blocks or so from my house without taking my medicine.

When an episode did occur, it lasted an excruciating amount of time, sometimes several weeks. And the treatments for it just seemed to get worse.

Eventually, my doctor had to take a look at my situation and figure out what the heck was going on. His conclusion: I was on way too much medicine, and that the medicine was causing my lung cancer to take over.

He made me take a pill every day, but it was nowhere near enough to make the medicine actually work for me – it was just a way to make sure that my condition didn't get worse. It was basically an extra set of wheels for a vehicle that, at the end of the day, wasn't running right.

If it weren't for the medication, and the fact that I was on a cancer warning, I would've never taken my medication. I'd have made the same mistake I made many times when I started to try to live without my asthma medication as a regular thing. The medication would've been a welcome distraction from the condition, instead of keeping it in the forefront of my mind. But it wasn't there.

That's why when I got sicker and sicker at the breast in 2015, I could not do anything about it. When I took my medication, nothing changed. When I just quit taking my medication, nothing changed.

I tried all kinds of treatments to try and find a cure for stage four lung cancer, but nothing worked.

Then, a few months ago, something happened that made me decide to just not give

The government's new legislation on encryption technology makes significant changes on the legal landscape surrounding digital encryption. Here is an insight to the amendments the government is introducing.

In the new legislation, the term "crypto" will be removed from the definition of computer programming, and all encryption will be regarded as "technological protection measures".

The aim of "technological protection measures" is to create "a way of protecting information by using technical means to control access". An example of such protection would be the use of strong encryption and a strong algorithm to provide security across the network.

"The aim of protecting information," the bill says, is "not to create the same level of security for the system as the government or a particular business that manages the system. Rather, information should be protected in accordance with the principles in the Bill". (The wording was not published in last week's final draft.)

The law will not ban software with back doors such as the "Trojan horse" found in the WannaCry ransomware attack or any other software with a built-in mechanism to provide a backdoor for the administration.

The legislation also will not remove any ability to search and access an encrypted computer network, unlike the UK's sweeping Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act that will end the "warrantless" surveillance on all UK residents. The legislation does also include a provision to require search warrants to be issued for search of computers on their network.

The government has also proposed that communications providers should have to "encrypt" communications by default and provide a technical means to enable this. The only exceptions to this rule are in those cases where an individual would "reasonably believe" there is a "reasonable expectation of privacy" in the information at issue – which is not easy to define – and would "need to do more than simply decrypt" the device.

The draft legislation also outlines a wide-ranging code of practice for companies that offer encrypted services, including: "providing encryption for communications that are at least as strong as the strongest known default encryption on the device;

providing encryption that is secure against any interception by third parties; and

providing encryption in relation to email messages, instant messaging, and web browsing activities". It will also include a separate code of practice for law enforcement on matters such as accessing encrypted data.

As with the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, the new encryption legislation will be subject to an extended public consultation. The government said it hopes to include additional submissions in the coming months.

The law also specifies that the Secretary of State, or a designated officer, may authorise the interception of communications, including those of companies. Such authorisations may involve the use of technology and would be subject to a judicial warrant on the grounds that the interception is reasonably necessary.

In terms of law enforcement, the new laws will also impose additional requirements on law enforcement, including giving access to communications that are encrypted in this way, which must provide a "level of protection that is at least as strong as the encryption on one's device".

The new law will require telecommunications companies to decrypt all encrypted communications and information that is being stored by them by 31 December 2017.

Read this Government introduces laws to crack encryption in smartphones The Home Office has revealed plans to crack encryption in smartphones, to make it easier for the police to access suspects' electronic communications in real time. Read More

The government has also announced that it will work with the country's major internet giants, including tech giants such as Google and Apple, to provide their own encryption tools and make the government's new encryption laws available to companies. This could be a significant step in helping to provide protection against cyber-attacks.

This is not the first time British government has legislated in relation to encryption. The last government, led by David Cameron, also introduced the Investigatory Powers Act in 2014.<|endoftext|>In a study examining cognitive function associated with early life stress, investigators found a relationship between a mother's relationship with her mother and the child's level of attention to aversive stimuli. The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural activity related to cognitive processing among 16-month-old children in response to an aversive stimulus. Participants in the study demonstrated greater cognitive processing with the presence of their mothers in the home.

"While the relationship between relationship complexity and child cognitive processing has been studied in a number of previous studies, our research focuses on an early family environment and its association with the development of later cognitive abilities," said the study's principal investigator, Lisa C. Leffler, PhD, an assistant professor of psychology at the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate. "Our study provides a comprehensive look into the potential pathways and mechanisms linking mother-child relationship characteristics to cognition over a period of a few years."

"Our study suggests that children's attention to emotionally arousing stimuli relates more to their mothers' relational quality,

"HELP! My baby is falling down the stairs and every time I pick her up she slips and lands right on her head! PLEASE HELP! If no one comes down the stairs she'll go into a coma!!!!!"

These are just a few of the dozens and dozens of letters that have flooded my mailbox since the birth of my daughter earlier this year. And this is a lot of emails, even for this kind of blog.

But it also saddens and motivates me, because this is my baby and I want her to grow up healthy.

And what you're reading is not an attack on the many wonderful things that come with having a newborn.

There's a lot of help out there, especially for new moms-to-be, and I'm just here to help- with whatever I can- you can help your child too!

When my daughter was born I was so nervous that I was going to have to deal with her breathing through a hole in my sternum, but I quickly learned she had a breathing tube in place to keep her from drowning. Since we had no other choice, we immediately followed the guidelines for CPR and began following basic guidelines for keeping her breathing until help came. I learned to work out where her throat was, make sure her mouth was open, and take care of her breathing. I also learned that she was going to be a little wiggly around the chest area at times but other times she was so stable that I didn't even have to worry. When her mouth was open and her lungs were working, I didn't have to do a whole lot, except keep her cool and quiet.

So here we are. She is 4 and a half now, just 2 months away from getting her own little breathing aid, and she now has a feeding tube in place that's going to continue for about a year. It hurts and it's an inconvenience but we're a family, we're willing to make a sacrifice, because this is important to both of us.

Here are some tips on what we've learned that other parents have found helpful:

Don't Panic

If your daughter starts to freak out (like we did during those first few days), do what comes natural. When she's calm, you can ask her questions and answer for her to calm her down, and then you can reassure her that everything's going to be fine. "We'll be here to catch you if you fall down. If you've fallen and landed on yourself, or something hurts your throat, just let us know so we can get you back up, okay? If you've fallen and landed on something soft (like a cushion), you can use your hands to catch yourself up," is a good tip for calming you down.

Don't Worry About Spots

We tried this one the first week after our baby was born. Spots can be annoying but if they appear to be spreading from your nipples, you can try to gently put your hand over them with your other hand to get a better look. If you find a spot that's spreading quickly (and it could be that a few of the spots are coming from your tummy), remove your hand immediately to stop the spread or if you find that the spot is going to spread from just one area of your chest to your nipples. When we went to get her checked up at that second office, they recommended that we do the checkups at home because they found some spots on her stomach, or on her nipples, and there were no spots visible as her body expanded.

Bathroom Time

I know this only applies to people who are using disposable diapers, because we're using cloth babies (because that's what I have). But if you have to go a day or a second when your baby has some liquid, put her on your back or on your stomach and wrap yourself around her. There are a few things your baby might need to drink while wet, but just like when you're having feedings in the kitchen with the bowl in front of you, just take a few breaths as you sip your drink. If your baby is having a hard time swallowing then you might want to just try not to squeeze too hard.

The Best Way to Cope

I wish there was one way for us to handle our child when they were in danger. And maybe there is one, and maybe not.

But for now, we know that it doesn't matter how good you are at CPR, what the doctors recommend, or what others suggest, it's only going to take a little bit of effort to get out of danger.

So, instead of having to worry, or having to think and prepare, you can just let the baby do what she needs to do.

And that's not something I can do for her or teach her. So she gets to decide what can be done for her. She might fall, or fall on something soft

The Supreme Court has taken the unprecedented step of refusing to hear a case that would have required the federal government to allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide. However, the Court's refusal to hear the case has not ended an effort by supporters to force the issue by asking the Supreme Court to hear their case.

The group, Marriage Equality USA (MEUSA), sued the U.S. Attorney General on Thursday alleging in part that her office was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by not issuing a decision on whether to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to the Supreme Court. The Defense of Marriage Act prohibits the federal government from allowing federal employees to recognize same-sex marriages of those who are legally married in a state they reside.

The plaintiffs' appeal filed on Nov. 18, 2013 states that on Nov. 19, 2013, attorneys for the Office of Legal Counsel advised the office that the Department of Justice would not file a legal brief defending DOMA against the lawsuit, but would instead file a brief for a federal appellate court. The Office of Legal Counsel informed plaintiff attorney Edith Windsor, one of the plaintiffs and a former plaintiff in the case, that this was not a "legal decision" and that there was no legal reason why there should be a gap of three weeks between the Office of Legal Counsel's decision and its filing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which heard the case on April 29.

DOMA has been the subject of a long fought battle between the gay community and the federal government. In 1996, DOMA was passed in the U.S. Congress as part of the Defense of Marriage Act. The law was signed into law by President Bill Clinton following passage of the Defense of Marriage Act in a lame duck session. It was then President George W. Bush who, two years after taking office, issued an Executive Order to prohibit federal contractors from discriminating in employment based on marital status.

However, same-sex marriage advocates say that the case has merit under Section 3 of the APA that states that no party has the right to bring a claim of legal discrimination in the court of law except under Section 5, even if the discrimination is in violation of federal law.

Meaning, "it's a legal dispute," but MEUSA is seeking to put forward a theory by which DOMA should be overturned by the judicial branch, not being the result of a federal lawsuit against the government. MEUSA contends that the U.S. Department of Justice is not upholding DOMA, which should be overturned, and has asked the court to intervene. If the court denies MEUSA's request, it will also be refusing to give its opponents standing to petition for a decision by the Supreme Court.

"DOMA is lawless, it is unfair and it should be overturned by the courts, but it should not be enforced in the courts. We're still hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will do the right thing and allow marriage equality," said Brian Brown, president of MassUnity.org. "This is just one of the many cases in which the Supreme Court has said that people should challenge laws without fearing the federal courts will say they lack standing to challenge these laws. The Supreme Court's decision to not hear this case makes it almost certain that the Supreme Court will not hear any cases on marriage equality."

Since same-sex marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court's historic ruling, Massachusetts has become the 19th State where same-sex marriage is legal. The law was approved just as President Obama was leaving office, and Gov. Deval Patrick (D) has been encouraging lawmakers to approve marriage equality as part of the state's 2016 budget. The budget is expected to pass by the end of this month.<|endoftext|>In an effort to make sure the United States was always one step ahead, the Department of Defense would occasionally send young men to be assigned to the world's most dangerous spots.

Green Bay — The Green Bay Packers aren't sure when the team's best receiver, and perhaps their best player, will return to practice.

But in the meantime, wide receiver Jordy Nelson and linebacker Clay Matthews are the top candidates — along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers — to lead the way in the offense in 2016.

The Packers announced Nelson had a concussion at Friday's practice and left the stadium under his own power. After being hit on what

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Friday named a longtime ally and confidant of his as his preferred successor to replace suspended President Enrique Pena Nieto, and urged Mexicans to back his candidacy.

Vicente Fox, a former candidate for President himself who is popular among conservatives in Mexico City, was named as the front-runner to succeed Pena Nieto, sources close to Pena Nieto and former President Fox said.

The announcement follows months of acrimony, after the president fired the head of the country's intelligence agency, the army, and Pena Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) accused the government of violating democratic norms in the process.

In his first public statement since the scandal broke, Calderon said that Fox "has clearly proven that he has both intellectual and character quality to be the president of Mexico."

"President Calderon trusts that he can perform the duties of the office with impartiality and professionalism," the former president said in a statement.

The election for the presidency must be held by Dec. 1 but the candidates can be elected later this year.

Calderon appointed Fox to chair a special committee of foreign ambassadors. The ex-president and Fox also share their birthday.

Calderon's departure is likely to be viewed as a concession to Pena Nieto, whose conservative People's Party lost support in polls after the scandal broke.

Pena Nieto has said he does not know whether he will go on after the December elections.

Carlos Salinas, the former minister responsible for the drug-related extrajudicial executions in the state of Coahuila and currently detained for life, is one of the leading candidates for the presidency.

The other potential candidate for the presidency is Piedad Cordoba, a political analyst with close links to Pena Nieto.

Calderon said he would advise Pena Nieto "as an advisor in matters of law and order," and "will do all that he can to support his candidacy and, as far as possible, bring a democratic and stable presidency to the nation".

Fox has also previously said Calderon's term was over and said he would vote for him, although he declined to make any specific endorsement.

A key vote-winner who once led the country's largest political party, Fox joined the PRI's conservative wing after he stepped down as president two years ago.

On the campaign trail earlier this year, Fox promised to "do everything possible" to improve the conditions for Mexico's poor.

Pena Nieto said that "at a time when Mexico's economy is in the midst of deep problems and uncertainty, to take any position against the democratic process or democracy itself is unjustifiable."

Pena Nieto, a 54-year-old former leftist Mexican politician, has been in office for less than a year after being sworn in at a brief ceremony in late 2015.

His administration has been plagued by widespread corruption allegations but the scandal has been overshadowed by a deep divide between the business and political elite in the country.

Pena Nieto has been accused of allowing business groups to interfere in policy-making, with the leader of one such group, who the president has accused of embezzlement, currently being held in jail.

Critics have said Pena Nieto has a poor understanding of how politics works in Mexico.<|endoftext|>AUSTRALIAN CHASMERS The history of Australian chases The first recorded Australian chases occurred in the 18th century. In 1802, an angry mob in Sydney, led by Captain John Murray, took the form of a large procession and was accompanied on this occasion by a small troop of horsemen of the Australian colony of New South Wales. This was the first major incident of an Australian chase. The following year, Captain Murray decided to get his revenge on the same group of people for his humiliating reception by the residents of Sydney. His troops captured a company of horsemen and a few of their horses and, having brought them before him, the Captain proceeded to ride them to the top of St. Paul's Hill which is immediately to the south of Little Bourke Street. From the top of this hill the chase took place in open country where the pursuers were accompanied by a large body of mounted men. The horses were led into a ditch along the edge of the hill for a distance of nearly three hundred feet. The crowd then made an attempt to climb up the hill and was met with a hail of bullets from one of the Captain's own horses. A small group of soldiers with bayonets came in to the rescue firing off their guns into

You might have to be dead to see this.

This is what the Google Earth satellite looks like after a NASA spacecraft crashed to the ground in Texas while trying to take panoramas of the moon. It was originally supposed to reach orbit and stay there forever, but the failure forced the U.S. Department of Defense to fly a backup orbiter (which was successful) and the satellite was "rebooted to take the photos and send them back to Earth," the NASA site explains.

The Google Earth site is working off Google data from November 2014 and March 2015, and it doesn't have the highest resolution images, but it does give you an idea of where the moon was and what parts of it looked more like Earth or Mars. The moon does appear a bit less reflective than when you first look at it from a telescope, but at least there's a good excuse for that.

Don't you worry about it

Don't you worry about a thing

And don't you worry

Oh, I want to tell you

That you're never alone

And I want to tell you

Don't you give up on things

Don't you give up on things


Oh, I want to tell you

Don't you make your own decisions

And I want to tell you

Don't you give up on things

Don't you give up on things


And when the time comes in the dark

I'll be there with you

And we'll laugh and look back on that little girl

Oh, I just want to tell you

The change, which is expected to take effect on December 14, will result in the loss of over a million jobs and a nearly $15 billion loss in revenue. What's more, the USPS is going to pay a $5.5 billion fine, the result of a decade's worth of misconduct, including accepting improper payments in excess of its legal limit and using contractors to ship illegal drugs. To make matters worse, the Postal Mail Act is coming under fire from Congress. And in fact, the USPS itself is the very organization that we've been fighting for to save us. We've asked the USPS to stop harassing us over a decade of fraud and abuse. We've asked the USPS to stop violating our First Amendment right to petition the government. We've asked the Postal Service to stop illegally seizing our mail. We've asked the USPS to stop shipping drugs, guns, and other contraband across our border. But our pleas have fallen on deaf ears; it looks like none of those requests have done any good.

This year, we've sent hundreds of letters to Congress. We've sent more than 500 petitions to the Postal Service protesting the planned sale of our postal monopoly. We've sent letters to more than 100 mayors, including Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other leaders from cities across America, pleading our case. The USPS is still violating some of our rights; it seems as though they're treating us as the wild, feral animals we are. The USPS, however, seems very, very content with this status quo. It recently released a video of a "dog day after" celebration involving employees. Our postal employees, many of them on second and third shifts, celebrated the holiday of "dog day after." The only problem is, no one seems to be allowed to keep a dog, in particular a miniature poodle named Max and his owner, Megan.

Max is a miniature poodle and Megan is his owner. Together, they've spent almost 20 years working as a mail carrier, and it's a job that Megan loves. Last year they were able to save up for a service dog. And Max, for his part, really enjoyed being recognized as a member of the canine species. So when the postal workers decided they wanted to keep him as a service dog, it seemed like a perfect fit. So why are they now refusing and harassing Megan and Max, in order to do just

There's been quite a lot of buzz in the media about how many immigrants have come to the US. In this post, I'll look at whether that's really the case and whether that leads to more problems or better outcomes for the US economy, society, and culture, or just a slightly different sort of thing we'd probably expect, given that the US is still the most successful example of a homogenous welfare state and immigration is usually a good thing.

This will be a fairly technical post; the best way to understand all of this stuff is to read my earlier posts on the topic, especially the more technical ones like "The Welfare Economics of Immigration," "The Effect of Immigration on Wage Rates", and "The Wage Penalty of Immigrants".

What Is the Effect of Immigration on American Wages?

Before continuing, I also want to make a few disclaimers:

There may well be some benefits of immigration to the US economy from economic diversity and spillovers, but those benefits aren't clear-cut and it's premature and probably misleading to simply take a snapshot of them right now.

There are lots of other things that might go into this, and I'm not claiming that these aren't important. But I will briefly address four issues: (i) immigration might affect wages in a few of the ways some people seem to think; (ii) immigration might change the types of jobs that people are willing to take; (iii) the effect of immigration on overall consumption might be positive or negative; and (iv) the way in which economists think about immigration effects on aggregate economic wellbeing.

There may be some benefits of immigration to the US economy from economic diversity and spillovers, but those benefits aren't clear-cut and it's premature and probably misleading to simply take a snapshot of them right now.

Immigration is good for the economy and society in a couple of ways. More immigration means more people are working (or working harder, if you prefer the phrase) and consuming more (see "The Welfare Economics of Immigration"), and more productive people (or people working harder) is always good for the economy. But, there are also some costs as well.

The first type that tends to be talked about is that immigrants might be less productive and cost the economy "assets." In fact, as we've already seen, it's easy enough to show that it's often true. Consider some hypothetical immigrants. Suppose the average immigrant has an annual income of $100,000 and has been living in the country for 10 years, which is a fairly typical time in which immigrants typically start their lives. They're a "dilutive" immigrant, meaning that their average consumption in the year they leave is below the average of all natives combined.

Immigrants are always less productive than the average natives and are more likely to take on debt.

What does this imply for the economy of the country in which the immigrant lives? The country doesn't "lose" those $100,000 in total output per year to the immigrants. The immigrants actually get more money than it costs to produce the output that the immigrants consume, which is also why it's always possible for the country to "reward" these immigrants by paying them higher taxes.

What about the other types of assets that they might provide? They're less likely to pay taxes (again, this isn't because they're necessarily less productive). But we know that immigrants are generally more educated than the average native, which implies that they're also likely to be more likely to work more hours, and in turn spend their earnings on goods and services.

Immigrants are always less productive than the average natives and are more likely to take on debt, which means that they don't contribute much overall to the country's wealth.

This all helps to explain why immigration has done somewhat well in the past, but how does it affect the economy today?

The Effects of Immigrants on Labor Market Outcomes

Before I get in to the benefits of immigration, though, let's first have a brief look at the possible downsides. There's some debate about how much immigrants have had an impact on the labor market, but there is very good evidence that it has been very small (or nonexistent).

One reason that people are skeptical of the impact of immigration on the labor market is that some of the jobs that immigrants tend to take seem like perfectly good jobs. Immigrants are overwhelmingly in low-wage, low-skill jobs, and it's hard to see how a big influx of immigrants into these jobs could produce big effects that people would care about.

If immigrants are disproportionately in low-wage jobs, there's not much you could do to make up for that. If they're disproportionately in jobs that people don't want anyway, those can't be fixed either. So, unless you think that the type of job that immigrants are taking is the kind of thing you would necessarily want, you have to conclude

I started to have doubts about the Wargaming forums a long time ago since many posters that i have encountered have been hostile or aggressive towards members of the server and the community. One particular time when i saw a poster was very aggressive towards players who had not done enough RP to get promoted to a high enough tier. That poster was a commander who had the following poster below as his signature:


In this photo, the only person in the poster who has done some RP, or not done all that much RP to get promoted to the first tier by Wargaming was me. The Commander who wrote that comment was a man called "Trupp". He was not only a very rude poster but a very mean person in general. He posted multiple offensive comments towards me and my friends even though they had not done any RP or RP level enough to get the poster's signature.

Trupp had been on both of the WG forums before I joined and had been known for making rude posts to other players (the same posters with the insulting signature of "Trupp" were on both forums before me too).

Since that day, most Wargaming posts on the forums are very rude and intimidating to players who have not done as much RP as Trupp had on the forums. One of his biggest ranting posts in his own thread was the one below:


There is also this:

WG Forum - Trupp: "A good rule is that if someone isn't doing enough RP for you, and you put in the time, you should be able to get them to do all of it."

One of Trupp's biggest ranting posts in the forum was the same poster above, when he did not get promotions for his RP: "If anybody is here who said they're doing enough RP, and you put in the time, I promise you'll never have to see anyone complain about you being a noob when they're done with their first 100 hours on the forum." This was even though he had done more RP than me himself and posted his own signature:

When all of this is done, you'll see a new "Trupp" and you'll realize that you are dealing with the same people that made the posts above, people that are rude to every single player on the server. That's what you need, the same type of people, for WG forums, WG's servers. These people are also the same type of people who make posts above telling the people in the forums to stop complaining because they did not do as much RP as the poster (who did not do much RP for the poster) himself did:

WG Forum - Trupp: "And if somebody doesn't have the patience to do the time, he shouldn't post here anyways!"

When i put into a post below the same type of people, i said:

WG Forum - Trupp: "For many reasons i don't agree with the poster above, and it's just not cool to be a dick here. If you're going to go after other posters, you know what you need to do to get rid of the trolls. Try to do the very same to me (as mentioned in the post above). Now get outa this thread and do some real rp. If you can, help people make their first 50 hours here and get RP to them. Make them come play in WGF."

I never expected other players to respect me and my friends more than this kind of "help" from the community, people who think that they can ignore the opinions of others on the server, because they "got a higher rank".

People like "Trupp" and others like him are the very reason why i don't want my friends and I on the servers anymore. They should not decide that they can do what they want to us. We are not allowed to have those kinds of forums. We need to get involved in community events, we need to give support, and we need to learn how to work with each other. I don't want to be the kind of person who needs to be punished/shamed/denied access/not be promoted or anything of that sort for something that i am doing with no problem.

When i said some people on the servers need to "work with each other" i didn't mean to insult these people. Many players, and a fair number of them players who are new and new to the forums, have started to help each other with their problems and problems with the games, in a very positive way. When i say "help" i didn't mean to insult the way that some players help each other to get rid of trolls or people like "Trupp", i don't mean to insult all "help" that is done by players of the servers. I don't even deny that. When i was new to the servers and i started to be active

Dietary patterns that are common with low self-esteem may also be responsible for problems with substance use and binge eating.

As part of a study on body image, researchers surveyed more than 700 women and concluded that women with low self-esteem were more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors like binge eating.

According to a new study published in the journal Health Psychology, women who were more likely to engage in dieting were also more likely to suffer with anxiety, depression and poor body image.

"Women with low self-worth may be more susceptible to binge eating due to negative images of themselves in the media, which may have contributed to previous research finding a relationship between binge eating and low self-worth," researcher Lisa M. M. Cogswell, PhD, in the department of Psychology, said in a statement.

Previous studies have found that dieting, in addition to being ineffective at making the body look a certain way, can lead to emotional problems. This new study, in addition to finding an indirect link between dieting and low self-esteem, suggests that dieting may lead also to some mental health issues to compensate.

The researchers found that of the 711 women in the study, 38 percent, or 118, said they had dieted to lose more weight. That number was roughly consistent with previous research, which has found a link between dieting and eating disorders.

Also similar to previous research, the women surveyed used a variety of strategies to diet, including trying to lose or trim down certain parts of their bodies, including their hair, and trying to limit portions.

The researchers found that women who were more likely to have a history of dieting also reported that they had higher levels of body-image dissatisfaction, a psychological state that may cause dieters to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as binge eating and self-image dissatisfaction.

Previous studies have shown that dieting alone does not change body weight, but when combined with a change in dieting strategies and/or a reduction in calorie intake, women can make small but substantial gains in their body weight.

However, women with low self-esteem and low body-image dissatisfaction are more likely to engage in binge eating because of negative self-esteem.

The authors noted that women who are dieting should be aware of a risk that they may be using diet to mask another problem.

"Although we were not able to show that dieting alone causes mental health disorders associated with binge eating and body dissatisfaction, it would be logical that if poor body image motivates dieting, it could also be responsible for unhealthy behaviors like binge eating and lack of exercise," Cogswell said.<|endoftext|>I don't get why it's important to make the point that the average person doesn't buy any books from Amazon. The answer is that people are buying from Amazon much more than they are buying from non-Amazon sellers.

I get that, but the people who do buy a book from Amazon do so from a non-Amazon seller. So, if you have a lot of non-Amazon sellers selling from Amazon, all those sales are going to someone who buys books directly from Amazon rather than from somebody else. That's great for Amazon, and if you just wanted to save some money, that's a good approach. But it's not the best way to make book industry-wide improvements. Amazon, for example, makes much more money from its marketplace than other major booksellers do.

Amazon is making a profit on all sales, in both traditional and digital formats, but not necessarily in all formats. But the other way to make book sales more efficient is to figure out how to move more of the business to the sellers themselves. Amazon is the only major ebook retailer offering this service.

The other way is to offer book distribution services on a wholesale basis. There are many booksellers who provide this type of service, including all of the major domestic distributors. But I'm aware of no other major e-tailer offering wholesale services. You don't have to tell me how good your service is. You just have to figure out the right market share, which you can use to your advantage.

For example, I have a book service that allows you to buy one or two new books when you have lots of free time — and then I sell them immediately. But I also have a service called Kindle Unlimited that allows you to buy a book once, read it on whatever device, then use whatever device you want to read the rest of it. You don't "buy" a book, you use it forever. So you can still consume a book from the Kindle Unlimited service once; you can even read every last word of any book in Kindle Unlimited after you've finished reading it. In fact, if you prefer not to read any book on your phone, you can even skip a book. So Amazon can offer a whole range of services, with one big advantage: It only needs some

The federation added forward Alex Morgan and defender Julie Johnston to its 25-player list for the upcoming CONCACAF Women's Championship. Both players have been called up before, but for different tournaments.

Morgan last played in the NWSL in 2013, with the Orlando Pride. She also played in the 2013 FIFA Women's World Cup, where she made two starts at the right back position.

The Seattle Reign striker did not play in MLS prior to the 2013 season, having spent 2011 with the Houston Dash. She made five league appearances and appeared in four matches with the Houston Dash Women in two seasons of the NWSL.

Johnston, currently in her first year with the Vancouver Whitecaps, has made six appearances for Canada, scoring once.

Johnston last made a league appearance with New Zealand in 2012, but only made one start at right back. The goalkeeper made four appearances at right back with the Kiwi Women in 2012, one of which she started.

Both Morgan and Johnston have been training with the U.S. women's national team since the start of the year. Both will arrive in camp with their national team after playing in their respective respective national teams.

The 25-player roster for the CONCACAF Women's Championship is expected to be announced on Jan. 31.<|endoftext|>From 1d4chan

Kroot: a species of reptilian alien soldiers, with a penchant for eating a particular type of cheese!

The Kroot are a faction of aliens from Warhammer 40k that were introduced in the latest codex, White Dwarf #15. They've come from the distant star-plexes of Kroot, which are a major source of the Imperium's food. They are particularly adept at cheese-eating.

History [ edit ]

White Dwarf article: Kroot [1]

The Imperial Guard are already in love with Kroot cheese. We all want to taste the delicious, sweet, and savoury tang of Kroot cheese! This may seem like nothing more than a passing fancy, but the Kroot have a more nefarious plan in mind! The Kroot are in the grip of a conspiracy to enslave humanity, and they'll use their cheese-eating skills in order to corrupt them, turning them into mindless Kroot slaves. This plan is, of course, all part of their plan!

Kroot and the Emperor [ edit ]

The Kroot were originally from Kroot, a star system located in the Eye of Terror as well as the largest one of its kind. The Imperium originally feared Kroot were a threat, as they are well known for eating flesh and have a predilection for cheese-eating. But this had been taken to an insane level after the Kroot discovered cheese-eating was a potent mind-control tactic. The Kroot quickly took advantage of this, and as the Imperium could no longer be sure of the food supplies of humans, they adopted the Kroot as an alien species. The Imperium hoped that if the Kroot adopted humans like a new form of domesticated pigs, they would adopt a similar mindset, and become loyal servants of the Imperium. The Kroot were granted to the Imperium as war beasts, and given new lives that were better than life as common Kroot.

This plan failed. With a single act of arrogance, the Kroot killed off the Emperor of Mankind and began using their skills as mind controlled slaves to enslave the rest of the galaxy. A new species of Kroot was born. This time, they ate cheese. These Kroot came to be feared throughout the galaxy as the "Witchhunters" or simply "Kroot" for short.

The Kroot Wars, the Imperium's first foray into fighting off a non-human race, has been raging in the Eye for a decade. The Imperium has sent out vast fleets of ships, some containing the Imperial Guard, against the Kroot in attempts to conquer the Kroot homeworlds of Kroot, Kroot, Kroot. But the Kroot have proven more than a match for the Imperial Navy and their superior technology.

So now the Imperium has found themselves fighting a two front war in the first few days of the Kroot Wars. Kroot from both of the Kroot Homeworlds have made themselves known, and

BARACK OBAMA has signed a law expanding background checks to private sales of guns and ammunition in a bid to keep guns out of the hands of criminals after the mass shooting in Virginia on Thursday.

Congress passed the law in part to try to keep assault weapons out of the hands of extremists. The National Rifle Association vowed to fight any attempts to enforce it, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who had a veto-proof majority, is expected to issue an executive order to the Justice Department later this week to implement the law.

Obama was expected to sign the gun bill as early as Monday and give a speech outlining his plans for the remainder of his first term.

Congress passed a similar bill, which has yet to go into effect, requiring background checks on people buying guns after the December 2012 massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 six-year-olds and six educators dead.

The legislation that went into effect had a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

The new law will add to a database that includes more than 160 millions firearms owners' names, addresses, telephone numbers and date of birth.<|endoftext|>A few days ago I got the email "You've received your new job. You should know what to expect tomorrow!"

That's actually good advice I should take a look at, so that's what I'm going to do.

First of all, there's a couple of points that should be important to make. I'm still in the process of transitioning between "unpaid internship" and "paid company internship", and it's not easy. So this is all very much "work in progress" and I'm trying not to make too many premature decisions about this part of my career. I was at TechCrunch in my last internship, and I was really glad about this as well. It felt way more organized and not like I was working on the same things over and over, with very little opportunity for promotion. So I like this idea of doing another and trying it both ways, and hopefully it'll work.

Second, we have to take a look back at last weekend…

Last weekends event was at DevConf that was held in New York. At the beginning of the weekend the event was a little bit "off", it seemed like a lot of people just got there with one thing in particular in mind. So it felt a little more loose and I was still learning a lot about the program.

I worked very late. It was around 9 or 10 PM and I didn't have anything to do, I was waiting for my friend Alex to come by for supper so I could spend the night with him. I had no idea what would have happened tomorrow, so I just hung out in a Starbucks coffee shop for a while until my friend Alex and I got home. After he left I felt super "meh". I wasn't feeling excited, I was just ready for the day to end and I wanted to go home.

I had more or less read most of the articles, watched pretty much every Youtube video, etc. after the event. I was getting pretty familiar with how the program works. So when I looked into the DevSecOps book I was a little bit surprised to see that at this event it had just published a special edition, with a "special guest author". It was this person by name Daniel Sturm. He is now not only the senior program manager, but also the head of the DevSecOps program.

I started reading Daniel's blog post this morning. There was a lot of useful information in there, but I'm still not sure if it's actually useful. For example, the part that I want to discuss is the one where he talks about the "culture of DevOps" and how that needs to move into a "culture of happiness" for the developers and the company. I have not found anything like this anywhere else, so that should give you a hint how much I dislike this part of the program.

My favorite part was the part where he talked about the "DevOps team" and how they need to "work together for the good of the company". I don't know what he saw in us to start with to think we're good enough to work together for the good of the company. Also, we have been there before. In the early days of DevOps everyone thought that everyone else was wrong, that DevOps was too hard to work on, etc., and so we started our own thing called The DevOps Team, and we just tried to work together, and we were successful for about 4 months. They said we were doing a great job.

So that brings me to my next point. I am not sure what the "culture of happiness" means exactly, but I'm pretty sure it means that each company has a culture that is different from the other companies. Every organization has its own way of doing things, that might be good for some,

Feminist Frequency's Anita Sarkeesian recently came under fire from both supporters and detractors after a video detailing her series on how female characters in video games are portrayed was removed and reuploaded onto YouTube. Despite a quick response from the creator and an acknowledgement from Google, the video remains nowhere to be seen.

Despite the controversy surrounding Sarkeesian, her campaign has yet to have an adverse impact on the gaming industry. She may not be receiving the praise she deserves as a result of her campaign; however, her opinions have been embraced and are still being listened to by many within the gaming community. In addition, some companies have even released their own forms of criticism against Sarkeesian over her lack of representation.

While the lack of content that was taken down for the video by YouTube does not really affect the overall video, many have still expressed their frustration with the situation. In fact, one user on Reddit was even going as far as to create a "Feminist Frequency Rewarded For Death and Rape" badge.

Sarkeesian was scheduled to address the issue at an event in London last night, but has since been forced to cancel her appearance. According to an interview with her on her Feminist Frequency YouTube channel she has decided to cancel for various reasons, including scheduling clashes with other planned lectures.

[Image via YouTube/The Feminist Frequency] In a video update on her blog, Sarkeesian wrote:

"So as of right now there is a lot of work I'll want to do prior to being able to continue this work—writing, editing and recording. I'm sorry to everyone who had paid attention to my talk in person last night and was excited about finding out what I actually had to say regarding sexist tropes in video games. I'm also sorry to the organizers of the event for the chaos and confusion our cancellation has caused."

Feminist Frequency has been making an effort all year long to provide content for gaming companies and developers to include in their games. While the lack of content might not have been the end of the world if it was simply something that has been covered by many within the video gaming industry and the community at large, the fact that it wasn't even taken out of the video in a matter of hours has left some with a pretty big question as to whether or not there was a problem at all.

Exports were up 6.4 percent, compared with the growth rate the U.S. government reported in October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

That's less than the 7.6-percent increase in October that some forecasters were expecting, but still strong. Exports were up 7.9 percent from the previous year, up from March's 0.7-percent growth rate, with the increase partly driven by better performance at major export markets, the report showed.

"With an increase in the unemployment rate of some 1.8 percentage points to 8.0 percent, there is no doubt that we will see more of these trade-related problems," said Adam Stoltmann, senior economist at Bank of the West.

Exports of goods such as cars, aircraft, machinery, agricultural products and pharmaceuticals, which account for two-thirds of all U.S. exports, were up 9.8 percent in September from the previous month, according to the report.

Retail trade fell 13.2 percent over the same period of time. Exports to Canada fell 8.7 percent. And, sales to Mexico fell 6.5 percent.

Exports of financial services declined more than 10 percent last month, while exports to China fell 6.7 percent.

Despite the soft numbers, economists expected export growth to come in above 8.0 percent.

The U.S. economy has expanded faster than expected since last month's government report.

But growth continues to trail forecasts. Earlier this month, the government said economic activity grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that exports jumped 7.4 percent in the second quarter, compared with growth of 1.9 percent for domestic firms.

The figures for September may have surprised many, though, because retailers such as Walmart and Amazon are not typically counted among other types of

While there is some similarity between each of these aircraft, they each have different strengths, weaknesses, requirements, and strengths. There are major differences in all of these, including in propulsion engines, radar, and sensor systems.

Although the F-35 has been in development for some time, it now comes into full view. A full technical description of the aircraft was published in the December issue of American Defense magazine. While some aspects of the F-35 are obvious (which I can't remember) other things are still not entirely apparent. The most important thing to know for the moment is that it is a stealth fighter designed to attack a relatively small target (a fast moving object) against a much smaller threat (the threat is a bomber or cruise missile) because all of these other planes can't really do it without massive modifications. The F-35's mission will be to attack other threats that other bombers or cruise missiles cannot, and also to defend itself (with the right air defense support) from attack by other bombers or cruise missiles. The F-35 in its current configuration is capable of all of this and more.

(click to embiggen)

When I began this project, the F-35 was on the drawing boards as an alternative to the F-16. It was expected that it would be a "little bit" smaller in size than the F-16. This led many to say that the F-35 lacked stealth, and there is certainly no way the F-35 could ever have been stealthy. However, with a number of upgrades that make the F-35 significantly larger than the F-16, it has a far greater level of stealth than is possible with the F-16.

The full technical description of the F-35 as a fighter jet is available, it was posted here.

The F-35 is more or less a large delta wing F-16 with a very large bomb bay and many other "add-ons" designed to give it additional air-to-air capabilities. These add-ons include the ability to fire laser-guided high-explosive JDAMs and the ability to carry air-to-ground weapons. Most of the F-18's air-to-air combat experience came from the F-15E Strike Eagle; the F-4 Phantom II was designed to attack ground targets; and the F-15 and F-16 have the best capabilities to attack the ground. While the F-15E and the F-16 were designed for air-to-air combat, the F-35's capabilities will likely be more suited in battle against other fighter aircraft (Bombers, cruise missiles, etc.) and cruise missiles. The F-16 is also more capable than the F-35 at "short" (20-40 miles) range combat.

The F-15 has the largest air-to-air weapons load-out of any aircraft in the world. The plane carries the AGM-65 Maverick missile loaded internally, but they can be carried externally with a standard 40-pound charge. The F-15A/B Super Eagle carries one AGM-84H Sidewinder internal pod and has another internal one to add one of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and they can also be loaded externally for a total of three of the AIM-9s. In short, the F-15A/B Super Eagle and F-16 have more weapons than any other fighter or bomber, and for a very expensive plane. A F-16E in the USAF carries one AGM-65C Phoenix missile internally, which can load one of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles with a 100-pound external charge, and one AIM-132 Stinger missile internally, which can fire six AIM-9s without external charge. A Mirage 2000D in the USAF is loaded with one AGM-109M Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) loaded with one of five standard Tomahawk missiles, and one external one loaded with the Tomahawk anti-ship missile, the AN/APG-76.

The Eurofighter Typhoon carries ten MICA air-to-air missiles internally and, in the Eurofighter Typhoon SE (with an internal bomb bay), has two internal weapons pods

As usual there are lots of different ways to build your game: you can combine traditional concepts or invent a whole new one from scratch. You might use Unity's built in scripting capabilities from day one, but instead of taking a basic scripting class you can simply learn JavaScript, a powerful and rapidly growing programming language.

Unity allows you to have a game built in less than 10 minutes, so if you'd like to start coding before you're even halfway through your project, go for it.

However, there are always downsides to using this way:

Unity is very powerful. It's not as user friendly as game engines like Unreal or CryEngine. If you intend to publish your game on a large scale then you might want to find out more about its licensing and business model. For the less technical, Unity allows you to write your games in Javascript for the sake of portability. To make this possible, it is a fully functional Javascript runtime and all the standard libraries that you might be used to.

The learning curve can be quite steep. It might seem like Unity takes a long time to get used to, but once you do the experience and learning curve can pay off. The game scripting part takes less than a day and once you go trough the basics you don't have to worry about it anymore.

It's not like other software development that you can find online. As a developer you're required to know a new language, and learn something different every single time you start a project. If you're just starting, that's going to be a hard sell. It makes the experience of taking over an existing or trying to come into a new engine really unique. It can even be an attractive alternative, as Unity often offers free credits to early Unity users.

So if you're a Unity gamer you could start from scratch on a new project, or jump ship and pick up a pre developed or written engine that already comes with game features. But if you're only a casual enthusiast or have never used one before then these might just be all the benefits you need out of a programming environment!

The United States has released a photo, from its military, in which an unidentified man is being interviewed by investigators, in Syria as the US-led coalition continues to strike ISIS in both Iraq and Syria.

The group said in a release that it identified the man as a local member of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the main US-backed rebel faction fighting to oust ISIS from Raqqa – the self-proclaimed caliphate group's Syrian stronghold.

In an effort to destroy ISIS, the Pentagon and SDF have worked together to create an international force of an estimated 250,000-600,000 troops, which has already managed to capture a number of ISIS strongholds.

The coalition is currently carrying out a campaign of airstrikes against ISIS across several different areas in Syria, using fighter jets, cruise missiles, drones and more. Last week, the US announced it had carried out 59 air strikes against ISIS in Iraq.

The release of the photo, which does not show the SDF member's face, comes as the US and several other coalition members have been reluctant to provide details about which military-aged men they are targeting in Syria. Since the start of the US-led campaign in August 2014, the US military has said it has killed roughly 500 to 6,500 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria – but those numbers have not been independently verified.<|endoftext|>The federal Conservative leadership race appears to have its first two contenders.

With only three weeks until voting opens and a big chunk of delegates still to be allocated, the race has opened up to the wider public thanks to video interviews of all nine contestants posted online this week by The Globe and Mail and iPolitics. The interviews have also been posted to YouTube.

Two other leadership candidates, Kellie Leitch and Michael Chong, were invited to the iPolitics interview but declined. The party has also invited all seven declared Conservative candidates to its fall party convention in Calgary next month.

Ahead of the leadership campaign, Mr. Kibbek spent time travelling to eight of the 10 ridings with some semblance of a leadership race (see sidebar for candidates in other ridings). The first thing Mr. Kibbek said in each of his interviews: He is not running for the leadership.

But the second-place finishes in Edmonton-Strathcona and Vancouver South make it clear that there is some traction.

"We saw these two parties start this up, and that trend is going to continue. But, right now, that is what I believe with respect to what the parties are doing," Mr. Kibbek said.

In Edmonton's Edmonton-Strathcona riding, which was part of the 2011 election that saw the Conservatives win 51 per cent of the vote, a survey by Nanos Research conducted in September and October of this year and reported this week by the Edmonton Journal found that Conservative candidates, even when they were outspent 2:1, won only 19 per cent of the popular vote.

The Liberal candidate, Wayne Drysdale (pictured, left), and Green Party leader Elizabeth May, who was first elected in Vancouver South five years ago, were tied for second place in the poll.

The result in the riding means the Conservative candidate, Linda Johnson, will need both the Green Party vote and the support of at least 17 per cent of Liberal voters to make the cut for a fall convention. The race has been wide open since the party first nominated Ms. Johnson.

In Vancouver South, which is the riding where Mr. Kibbek was first elected after being elected as the Liberals' candidate in 2000 and represented them in the federal NDP until 2008, a poll by Forum Research conducted in March saw the two Liberal candidates tied for first place in the riding. It also showed that Mr. Chong led in that riding ahead of the June election. Both Mr. Kibbek and Mr. Chong have indicated they are still considering entering the race.

"It's always a big risk to be a candidate, but if you're a politician that is going to bring some new ideas and some new ideas to the table, I think the party is ready and willing to consider it," Mr. Chong told iPolitics earlier this year.

With that in mind, the party has yet to rule out a leadership contest for both the current leadership candidates and for Mr. Kibbek. The leadership criteria are not set in stone just yet, though.

Party bosses are meeting later this month to discuss their options, said party president Rick Dykstra in a telephone interview on Friday afternoon.

"We recognize that there is a huge amount at stake to determine the next leader of the Conservative Party and that leadership contest is an extraordinary event," he said. "We have made it a priority to make sure that we are as inclusive as we possibly can be of all voices. We are going to gather the voices of

After months of being largely ignored and mocked by the media and the political mainstream, Hillary Clinton gave a fiery speech on Wednesday night during which she finally acknowledged what everyone has been saying for months: The only reason Donald Trump is President-elect is Barack Obama's fault.

"I am so grateful that President Obama is gone," said Clinton. "I mean, I don't think it's possible to describe what an enormous relief it is to be out of the daily chaos and the daily grind and the daily fight. I can't wait to get to work on behalf of the American people."

Trump supporters have long claimed that Clinton made this speech to "whistle-blow" to her supporters, and to the country at large. However, Clinton clearly did it for reasons other than that: Acknowledging the massive blame that should rightfully be placed over her former boss, Hillary Clinton admitted that even before the election she knew that it was Obama's fault that Trump is in the White House.

"People often say to me, why are you still involved? And I tell them, 'You know, I've been around too long,'" she said. "There's just no doubt in my mind that if Donald Trump had beaten me, he probably would have been a little less inclined to be unpredictable and a little less inclined to start World War III."

It will probably take a couple more weeks before Hillary has to defend her actions in making this remark, but it will eventually come. The reality is that Trump has been a clear and present threat to the national security of our country for years. The Democrats have actively enabled this threat through their obstruction of Trump's Cabinet nominations, support of illegal acts such as the Muslim Ban, and now their refusal to even consider his appointments.

What do you think about Hillary admitting that it was Obama in 2008 who started World War III?

In 1980, Gates sold his stake in the project to C. Douglas Dillon, a businessman and Microsoft investor. Today, he is the richest person in the world, and he's the most innovative billionaire in the world.

In honor of his new book, The Road to Microsoft: How I Took a $10 Billion Startup and Organized the World's Most Influential Company, we're doing an interview with Bill Gates about all he's accomplished over the years. We talked about his early years at Microsoft, the creation of Microsoft Word, his most important investments, why he's not working on personal computers, and more.

The American Health Care Act was officially filed this week with the Senate and its House counterparts. The legislation, which would roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also repeals a number of government regulations and imposes changes in tax credits and coverage.

Under the law, consumers will be able to shop around for a plan that fits their needs by paying only the premiums for the lowest-cost plans available. They'll also be able to shop around for less expensive plans with lower deductibles.

Those with pre-existing conditions could use a new high-risk market to get treatment that would be covered under their old plans.

The American College of Emergency Physicians, an organization of nearly 200 physician groups that represent more than 11,000 emergency physician members, said the law's "regulatory changes may result in a patchwork of health care plans across the country."

Among those concerns is a provision that says federal authorities will be able to prohibit carriers from selling plans in different states that have different laws governing insurers.

The health care act now heads to the White House for review. It has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, which will start debating it June 6, and to the Energy and Commerce Committee, which will hold a hearing June 13.

The committee will begin in-depth discussions on the bill's impact on insurance pricing and coverage.

One provision in the legislation, known as the Price Act, would allow health insurers to renew insurance plans that are canceled or changed early by consumers in the coverage gap. The law would limit the time period where the plans can be re-sold.

Under the current law, policyholders will be grandfathered in, which means the policies are generally guaranteed to be sold for at least two more years. This gives enrollees a year
======================================== SAMPLE 113 ========================================
If I could find my keys, I would make sure to take all of my valuables and the clothes on my back and move to the suburbs of my house, preferably just after the sun falls in the sky.

My mother told me this story when I was 15-years old, and it didn't make me feel particularly good. She had been murdered while working for the FBI, but in my mind, she'd been murdered at her job because I was going to go to Iraq.

So, I had a pretty good idea that the FBI's "investigation" into her death would be a charade. The only thing I couldn't figure out was why she didn't tell anyone she was pregnant, that she had two children, or that she had gone missing. My mother had been on her feet for over a month before the FBI realized that a woman they had spent five years looking for couldn't be a suspect.

The only person I talked to in the entire investigation was my ex-best friend. I remember him being very worried about me and the police searching his house, and it hit me in a way no interrogation could. The FBI seemed obsessed with the idea that our friendship was somehow related to her disappearance.

That was the last week I was in the room. The police left a few days later without me or my mother and left me with the man who had tortured me for three years, and then lied about the whole thing. I had no one to turn to; no one to tell my story; no one to defend me; no one to go to prison for. It was like a bad dream that had just suddenly come to life.

Years of feeling like I was completely lost to the world and the only people who mattered were those that would defend me with violence were suddenly gone. I felt like a criminal instead of a victim at that point in my life.

The worst part of the whole experience is that the FBI had no idea what had happened to my mother. Even the man who confessed to me, and he told me this over and over in front of the man I thought was my best friend, didn't know anything about what had happened to her. He said she had disappeared into a dark underground passage from which nobody ever came out.

But he did tell me what happened to her days after she left me, as a way to get sympathy from me. He told me she had been killed during an armed robbery of a bank, and he said that the only thing he knew for sure was that she was pregnant.

I knew that's not true, and that's why I was so angry with him. I hated him for ruining my mom's story, for saying my mother was murdered, and for taking away everything we'd shared during our first three years together.

One night after getting out of the mental health unit that the FBI had set us up in, I had a conversation with my mom. I sat her down and told her that I was going to Iraq and that I had a lot of things I had to do, and that I would need her help.

"I'm going to Iraq, are you sure you want me to leave you?" she asked.

"Why not?" I answered. "What better way to spend the last week of July in July? As long as I'm with you, you won't be alone in this world."

"I don't want to leave you," she cried.

"No you won't," I assured her firmly. "You won't be alone because I'll be here for you while you're there. I'll be your best friend in Iraq, no matter what happens." After all, I thought, it might as well happen the best way possible.

I was so young that I had no idea that anything I did here would have any meaning for my family. As it turned out though, my mom loved me so much that even when I thought my adventure was over, she refused to let me go.

I spent the next year doing everything I could to keep my mom together during her hospitalization. I went back to school with her so that I could stay close to her all the time, I made sure I got a job so I could have enough money to get by while she was gone, I put my grades in one of our two local schools so I could get some extra money to pay rent. I kept her in my life and did everything in my power to make sure we had each other. Even when she asked me to leave her, I didn't.

And it worked.

When I got out of the hospital at the end of July 2008, I went back to visit my mom at a nearby nursing home. I remember the day clearly. As soon as I walked into the room, she looked up at me and smiled. A few minutes later, she reached out and gave me a long, deep kiss. She

Fossil fuels are still crucial for the energy needs of the world. There is still a need for alternative energy sources as well as a decrease in their relative price rate. However, despite the global dependence of fossil fuel on fossil fuels, the demand for fossil fuel remains very high and there is a significant amount of fossil fuel reserves which are yet to be exploited. Hence, fossil fuels are being produced at very high price and are yet to be exhausted.

What is the reason for such an excess of fossil fuel reserves? The primary reason is the large level of production of fossil fuels through extraction of the petroleum based oil and gas. The other important reason is the huge growth in the consumption of fossil fuels in the developed countries which caused high levels of oil price, even though the cost of producing it is high.

The total energy intensity of fossil fuels has dropped over the course of the last 80 years, as the energy costs are declining. The growth in energy use in the developed countries which is mainly based on fossil fuel and has contributed to the high relative price of fossil fuels.

It was estimated that the production of oil from conventional sources is increasing at an annual rate of 8% but this rate is steadily decreasing as it takes time, effort and resources to develop conventional sources of fossil fuels, that are mainly based on fossil fuel reserves. However, there are a number of unconventional fossil fuel source of the energy, which have yet to be developed, but with their development will have a great impact on the economic and energy balance between the developed and less developed countries.

However, the use of renewable sources for energy has been increasing with respect to consumption, which has also resulted in decreasing the rate of growth. The use of wind is the way to go in terms of renewable sources of energy. However in developed countries, where wind and solar resources are very limited, it is more suitable to use other renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric energy, biomass like wood and bio energy which are more practical and efficient than wind and solar source of energy.

In addition to the use of renewable source of energy, natural gas has been rapidly expanding to become an important alternative source of energy and the use of natural gas which is the least expensive and the purest form of fossil fuel, is increasing significantly due to the increased demand and supply for energy from the developed countries where natural gas is heavily marketed.

The use of oil is going to be a major issue in the future since the rate of growth of the global oil supply at present can't accommodate the growing global demands and the decline in oil prices.

The demand for oil has been rising at 1% with respect to population and world economy. The global rate of oil demand has been declining with respect to population and world economy in recent years and oil supply has been growing at about 1%. Given the high level of oil prices, the demand and supply of crude oil has been declining which has affected all oil companies and contributed to the overall decline of the world oil market.

Oil is currently being provided at very high costs by several nations. Due to the high cost of oil, it is still profitable for foreign oil companies to supply oil, which is primarily being used in fuel, to countries which want to export oil. This is the way for oil production to continue in the developed countries, which are trying to develop their own sources of fuel but without taking into account the environmental impacts, which is not only very important for countries on the developing countries, but also for the developed countries such as the USA.

A large number of oil wells are being drilled on land where there is oil which are unable to be economically and environmentally developed due to the high cost of oil, although there is a large quantity and it can be extracted even at the high prices of oil, yet it is highly unlikely that the oil wells will be completely developed, with the oil wells being drilled into the ground. It is estimated that there are about 10-11 billion barrels of oil that are yet to be released to the market in the USA where there is a huge demand from the US military.

The amount of oil that is produced by fracking in the USA has been increasing since 2013 and in the future it is likely that the USA can only meet the demand of the military as long as it continues to supply gas to the US. The USA is a large consumer of natural gas which has a very high price of $15 per million BTU; which means, the demand for gas in USA is expected to increase significantly in coming years.

Natural gas is an important component of the generation of energy from renewable sources in the USA and in many countries with large consumption of energy the demand of natural gas has already outstripped the amount of natural gas that is available for the generation of energy.

The USA is the biggest consumer of natural gas in the world, which has a consumption of about 6%, which is larger than its economic production. The high cost of natural gas has caused the USA to import about half of the total natural

Mortin Harket, chief executive officer of Google, was interviewed at the annual Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in New York.

At the event, Harket fielded the question of whether people would stop using search engines like Google for the company's own personal services or for social-networking sites like Facebook. The Google search results are the main reason people will still use Google for search results in Google, where the company earns a 30% income before taxes.

Google recently unveiled its online shopping tool and will roll out a similar service later this month for online travel. While Google has long offered services that allow people to search for travel advice and book hotel rooms, the new feature will let people search for flights and hotels on their way to locations, such as a vacation or a wedding. Google hasn't confirmed whether those services will be sold as add-on services or have a standalone app.

The social networks are more dependent on the revenue generated through advertising, which is why Facebook is trying to monetize its Facebook search results. The companies have made an agreement to work together on the "Next Gen" social-networking site as reported in Re/code.

Harket said it is tough to judge social networks like Facebook, which has grown so quickly, and it won't be able to predict what the overall revenue can be. "Facebook is going to grow so very quickly. And we understand that, and we want to compete against it. That's not what makes us successful," he said.

He also defended Google's Android operating system. In the interview, he said Android has a "better user experience" than rival iOS. Harket said Apple's iPhone is "better than any Android phone."

Despite its rapid growth in search results, Google's revenue per search engine dollar has been steadily falling. The company is projected to bring in $2.3 billion in revenue per year from search in 2013, down from $2.6 billion the year before, The New York Times reports. Harket claimed that the decline is mostly a result of lower advertising revenue, which has been influenced by shifting habits from users. "Social media in particular will have a big impact on advertisers, but I think all advertising needs to change," Harket said.

As far as other personal services for Google, it will add maps to Google Maps in the coming months. "Mobile is our biggest opportunity. We've seen some companies come and go, but Google maps is what people are already using on smartphones," Harket said, adding that the maps app will be free at launch on iOS and Android.<|endoftext|>DURHAM, N.C. -- Clemson players gathered around quarterback Deshaun Watson as he sat on a bench waiting for his name to be called in the Orange Bowl. They were worried. Watson was worried -- a lot.

The quarterback was nervous and scared, he told his teammates -- anxious not to let the opposing team win the game, worried that his teammate was going to get hurt or worse.

It didn't happen. But to Watson, it was just one of two games in his life where things went terribly wrong for him.

"I had to go through what he went through to get back to where I was," Watson said. "The fact that I was even playing as good as I was for the majority of this time says a lot."

Watson threw a game-winning 35-yard Hail Mary to end the game as Clemson beat Florida State 38-35 for the national title Thursday night. Watson went 31-for-40 for 385 yards and four touchdowns.

Watson then had to walk off the field and get checked for a concussion after he threw a deep pass to Mike Williams with under two minutes left. No one knew if he took a hit.

"But I got back in the huddle and I tried to just go in and go to work," Watson said. "That was the first time I had ever stepped on the field like that. I was just happy to get back out there and play."

Watson, whose father passed away when he was only 7, had a chance to win it himself. He finished 12 of 22 with four touchdowns. Clemson's offense was dominant throughout and ran for a school-record 565 yards.

For one game, Watson has been able to play. He was not at 100 percent in Thursday night's game. The Tigers still won.

"He's playing good football," Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. "But I can guarantee you that had he not been hurt, Deshaun would have tried as hard as he possibly could to help win this game."

Watson, who set an Orange Bowl record in 2013 when he passed for a school-record 458 yards in a loss to Alabama, was the only senior on Clemson's roster. With his mother, he had been at a standstill after the death of his

When an Israeli military commando was killed recently in Gaza, the U.S. went from saying it would not take sides until the issue of Palestinian rights was settled to offering up a robust defense, including its own "indirect" support by providing Israel with ammunition.

"We are deeply concerned about human rights violations and want our governments to have the chance to do more than just take statements at the United Nations Security Council," said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki at a briefing in London on May 31, referring to the U.N. Human Rights Council.

Asked if Israel's assault on Gaza was justified, Ms. Psaki said the U.S. condemns all violence and is committed to a peaceful two-state solution. "We are committed to the ability of Palestinians and Israelis to live side-by-side in peace and security," she said.

The statement was issued after Israel's military struck Gaza last week in response to a barrage of rocket attacks launched from the enclave by the Islamist movement Hamas—an assertion dismissed by the militants who have fought back with a wave of suicide bombings.

The Palestinian death toll so far rose to at least 1,049—a majority of them civilians—according to Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Kidra.

Israeli military said at least two Israeli soldiers were killed in the operation in Gaza. One of them, 16-year-old U.S.-born volunteer Gila Cohen, was killed by shrapnel to the head after an explosive device blew up nearby. Ms. Cohen was the only American citizen killed in the conflict, the Pentagon said.

In an interview published in The Guardian and several other publications on Monday, Ms. Psaki said Mr. Cohen was a volunteer, paid for with a civilian government grant. "This was an American, a U.S.-trained volunteer, who was part of our efforts to train foreign nationals to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces," she said. "He did not receive any direct assistance from the United States, and he was not funded by U.S. taxpayers."

Ms. Psaki also criticized the Hamas rocket attacks for spreading anti-American sentiment. "We have a long-standing, strong commitment to the security of our Palestinian citizens and we think that's a very important aspect of any kind of dialogue," she said.

It was Mr. Cohen's death—first reported by Israel's Ynet daily—that triggered U.S. condemnation. The State Department on Tuesday called his killing "tragic and unacceptable," demanding that the "Hamas terror organization immediately halt such attacks."

Ms. Psaki also spoke out against the rocket attacks launched from Gaza. "Rocket fire that spreads across this borders and puts innocent civilians in harm's way does not have a place, and any party to these conflicts must respect the sanctity of civilians, including the civilian population who make up the Gaza population, and must prevent those individuals…who use civilian populations as human shields, as part of Hamas' efforts, and who are directly and indirectly funded by Hamas to use human shields," Ms. Psaki said.

Ms. Psaki said the U.S. stands by Israel's "right to defend themselves, to protect themselves, to protect their security, to protect their very, very legitimate right" to go after the Hamas movement.

The Pentagon responded, again, with a stern rebuff.

"This is a complex situation, this is a complex issue," said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. "We would point out that the United States, the State Department, the U.N., the European Union all make very strong statements about human rights. And we believe it's important for us to make clear that this is a human rights issue. It's not an Arab-Israeli issue."

For Israel, the question of whether the rocket attacks are legitimate or illegal has become a matter of national security rather than a humanitarian concern.

Israeli security officials are bracing for more rocket attacks from Hamas despite the loss of some senior members of the movement, including senior operative Samir Kuntar.

Last spring, there was a brief flare-up of tensions between Israel and Hamas—the two sides agreed to a ceasefire in April and launched a 10-day operation aimed to cleanse militant militants from Gaza.

After taking full control of the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu has said Israel will continue to strike at its enemies—not only Hamas but also Palestinian political leaders who are supportive of the Hamas movement in West Bank.

Frozen is not a Disney/Pixar movie, it is a Disney animated movie from Pixar.

Here I am, the person who hates it, writing about it. The movie that so many people hate. It's the polarizing movie everyone rages about even though it's just a good movie from what I've seen. It's the movie everyone says should come out and it hasn't.

Disney/Pixar knows that people like Frozen. But they don't want to make a sequel, because they like the first one and don't want to disappoint it's fans. So, Frozen 2 was always going to be a way off. And so, there was no way in hell I'm writing about this movie.

However, this movie was one of the most polarizing movies I've seen in my life, so my girlfriend and I decided to watch it a few weeks ago after she read my hate guide to it (it's the only one written by me after all.) We are fans of the movie, but we've also watched the worst Disney movies to get into the right mindset for Frozen. And there is ONE thing that we learned from that movie…

1. Don't hate the movie until it's released and you're getting tickets to it anyways

When Elsa was originally revealed as the Princess Elsa of Arendelle it was greeted with a lot of excitement. People said how funny it would be and how she'd be even better than the first one.

But then a few weeks after it came out, the movie was released! Well, almost. It never happened. It seems to have been delayed by some kind of legal trouble, but the movie ended up being delayed on the Disney schedule anyway and was finally released in the UK for a limited time before being quickly pushed to other countries like the US and Canada.

But that was the movie… Until now.

We watched the movie at a friend's house and I was the first one to say we shouldn't hate it. I mean, we probably weren't expecting that much of it by any means, but we have seen so many poor Disney movies and this was a decent movie from where they left it. Elsa is a lot of fun to watch. She is the Princess we all know and love and she makes the best ice queen I've seen.

But we didn't hate the movie until we went to go see it and we saw the new trailer. And the thing is, the trailer was just a preview of the movie and it doesn't change anything or say anything that changes that you saw in the movie. That's not to say I think the trailer is bad, I think the trailer is pretty solid, but I do want to change something. For whatever reason.

I just want to change something about it. Like… I want to change Elsa's name to Ice Queen. I think Elsa's name is boring. Her name makes sense when you read the book, but if you go on the internet to read about this movie it doesn't. Ice Queen is a much cooler name.

This petition is to change it, by popular request. If we get enough signatures we'll get the petition on the official site for the movie and see where it goes from there.<|endoftext|>TODAY'S COMIC: The Lazy Wizard and the Bored Wizard

I'm looking at a stack of old school comic books, where we have Wizard Lazy Wizard, Bored Wizard, and others. Wizards would read these books and become bored, so then they would have to put the books down, and would eventually find a new book to read to keep the boredom at bay. Then the Wizard Lazy Wizard would pick it up and read it over and over again until finally that stupid Wizard Bored Wizard would have to quit in frustration. It's hilarious. Enjoy!

I want to thank everyone who took the time out of their day and made this a wonderful day to be an artist! There were so many people that were involved in helping making this comic a success from all of you. Also thank you for all of the encouragement and support all of you gave on social media to the whole process of making this comic. We could never get as far as we did without you guys making the comics so much fun!

It has used its power and influence to lobby for reasonable reforms that would strengthen safety standards and protect public health, as well as to promote responsible and responsible ownership of firearms.

In this respect, the NRA has been an essential part of the American debate. It took a stand against gun control early in the century, when the first attempt was made to ban military-style rifles. It resisted and fought back on several fronts against efforts to impose a gun licensing and registration act in the 1980s and '90s.

======================================== SAMPLE 118 ========================================
A few miles south of the village of Varese, Italy, is the village of Largo (pronounced "Largo," as in the sound a largo makes). With approximately 600 residents, Largo feels a little more like a small city in Europe than a rural village – in fact, the locals make it sound like a great city. At least, a quaint city of one – the city is home to four churches and two schools, and is the hometown of two famous actors – Giovanni Rigano and Antonio Maffei.

In recent past, Largo's residents were a mix of Italian residents coming to Varese to live, as well as English and Italian speakers from Northamptonshire, Scotland and Scotland. With the town's location along a narrow, winding road (as most are in central Italy), Varese was also known as the city of angels; according to legend, if you crossed the Largo River into Varese, on your death you would still be in heaven.

Since about the early 20th century, however, the church in Varese has been experiencing some growing pains because of the town's low population and low tax base – not a good combination, in many ways. Now, there's a battle raging between the residents of Largo, those of the neighboring town of Bologna, and the village of Bologna.

To make a long story short, when Bologna built a new library back in 1998-99, it decided to renovate the structure without consulting the residents of Bologna. In response, Largo residents – who had no idea about the plans to move in – protested, leading to a series of clashes between the two towns that culminated in a brief war back in 2009. Now, the residents of Largo are trying to prevent the demolition of their church, which has been home to the church since 1927. If the fight against the church continues it could result in the permanent relocation of Bologna's entire church population to Largo (even though the people of Bologna have already moved to new homes elsewhere).

To make matters even more complicated, the two churches have different types of architecture. Largo's is more Gothic than Bologna's, and it's the more ornate of the two.

I've met with a local resident of Largo and I asked her if she thinks Bologna will be forced to relocate. Her reply: "No, it will be fine."

But here's the thing: Even if Bologna gets the green light to move its entire population to Largo, Largo will still maintain an independent community. Why? Well, because Bologna is still a huge town with a population of close to 40,000, and it will still have to pay the taxes of their many (many!) residents.

I asked the local citizen of Largo if this is what's called a "dividing line of death" – i.e., a town that's split from itself between its population living inside and outside. Her response: "Not so much. Even the residents of Bologna will pay for the upkeep and will continue to pay taxes to Largo."

This is also the sentiment I got from a local resident of Bologna; a man named Roberto De Gregorio tells me, "The new Library of Bologna will close the gates to the rest of Largo for two weeks so that people can come here and enjoy and know that this is their town too. If we are forced of course, we will leave for Largo in the morning. The new Library of Bologna also proposes to bring in a new bus service to Bologna to help us get around between the two towns – although at present the new Library does not connect them."

Still, there is still the possibility that they will eventually have to move because someone somewhere in Bologna wants to move out, but they hope this problem will be solved at the very least.

There's also the question of the financial impact of the newLibrary. Although Bologna did not have to pay for the development costs related to the new library, they do have to pay for a portion of the maintenance and upkeep. Will Bologna simply be left holding the bag? Will they be forced to make up lost revenue due to a higher cost, or will the newLibrary provide enough additional revenue to absorb the increased maintenance costs?

Ultimately, it's very hard for me to answer these questions… but for now, I can say that I think the best thing for both towns would be if this issue could be resolved quickly without any major injuries.

To help you make your decision, I've put together this infographic that summarizes the differences between the two communities and why one seems to be in a better position than the other.

I was asked to attend the DICE 2013 keynote, and being an avid fan of Battlefield and the Battlefield franchise, it seemed like a perfect opportunity. The event was held in Hollywood, CA and I decided to watch and learn as much as I could, just in case something big happened. Unfortunately, the keynote didn't go my way. This is my review of the keynote.

Battlefield Hardline – The Call of Duty of Video Games

The Battlefield series has always excelled at storytelling. It has been a mainstay in the series for many years. In the latest installment of the Battlefield franchise, all that is left in the game to be described as pure fantasy.

The story is more about the game that it is about the story. This is why the game is so much different from the previous installments. The characters that the player starts off with are a bit fleshed out, and I think it will be necessary for someone who is in the game for the first time to understand what exactly is going on. From the beginning, the story feels like it is a bit shallow, and can be confusing when you first start out.

This is a big problem when it comes to storytelling in video games. It can be easy to get caught up in the game itself and forget the story. The most frustrating thing, however, is that if you do not play the game, you cannot see the game as a whole. So, when you do play the game, there is no way for you to appreciate the story. Not the story, certainly, but the story as a whole.

The game is about cops and criminals in the city. I am not really sure how the game handles crime, but it is pretty obvious that criminals are bad, yet law enforcement officers seem to have a problem with crime as well. I think a lot of the story is based on the fact that law enforcement officers are so used to solving crimes that they are overconfident when they are trying to stop someone.

After playing the game for a little bit, I learned that it seems more like a cop drama, where you get to watch them go up against criminals who have all sorts of weapons, weapons that law enforcement officers are not used to encountering in the real world.

Overall, I was not really impressed. It's a lot of story, but it is a cop drama, which can be frustrating when the game itself is not so interesting. The only things I liked about the story was the portrayal of the police officers and the characters that we see in the game, that had more depth than what we have seen before in a video game. There are times when I felt like it could have been better, but the game is really what is important. The game is just a part of the story. It may not be the whole story, but it is a cool part of the story. Overall, it was a bit disappointing to see a game that is based on one franchise completely forget about the other franchise during such a big event.

Battlefield 3 – The Ultimate Multiplayer Experience

Before I start talking about the story, let's talk about the multiplayer experience. With its new features, it has been a major push to increase the realism of the gameplay. A lot of people were disappointed about the Battlefield 3 multiplayer, so I am sure that they had lots of questions about its features.

I am going to give you my quick take on the game.

I will start with the guns. Yes, I know there are a lot of people here, like me, that will argue against the use of those machines, but they are the main weapon on the battlefield. I have had many a gunfight where I have pulled the trigger over and over again and it was never really a good result. There is a limit to how fast you can go, and you can only have so many guns on you. But, if you were able to learn and exploit those limitations, it is possible for you to pull off a really good gunfight.

I was talking about the guns on a different point, but the game does bring back a lot of the weapons from Battlefield 2 and even BF1. The game features a wide selection of weapons to choose from, and some weapons have been given new weapons. But, there is a limit. It is not really about how you kill someone, but how you use that weapon. Just like we talked about with the story, it seems like when the story is told, it tends to focus much more on the action and not the story.

The game, if it is a shooter, is not something that should be compared to Battlefield Hardline, as it is trying to do something new with its gameplay options. I did feel that this game could have gone a lot further in the simulation mode. One of the biggest issues is when you reload, you must have the correct magazine, or you are in trouble. The gun has to be balanced perfectly before firing again,

Penguins winger Phil Kessel spent about an hour with reporters Wednesday morning in Toronto. You can have the entire thing here.

He spoke about the trade of Sidney Crosby to the Pittsburgh Penguins, and his goals for the season.

His one-line answer on whether he has any interest in returning (to the Maple Leafs, of course) was that he hasn't made a decision yet.

"I've got some work to do this summer and I want to be better than I have been this year and I want to be a better player. I've got a lot of things I want to work on, but you never know until you get in that type of competition." –Kessel on whether he's a Maple Leaf or not.

On Pittsburgh's first game against the Penguins, Kessel said it felt great to see his old team.

"They're a very veteran team and they came in with a very good attitude. They prepared well and they came here and we got the job done.

"There's no question about it. It was exciting to see them and it was exciting to come here and compete with them." -Kessel on competing with the Penguins.

His thoughts on the Penguins winning their second Stanley Cup in as many postseasons:

"This is a special team and I'm super honored that they were able to do it when everyone says that teams don't win it. They deserve to be here and I'm super happy." -Kessel.<|endoftext|>For the most part, women have been able to "lean in" to the male breadwinner role without worrying that they will come out on the losing end of the marriage bargain. But new research adds to the recent evidence that women are losing the battle of the sexes.

A big increase in cohabiting and unwed mothers, more single women than ever before, women who work part time, a trend toward co-habitation, and the emergence of "second marriages" in which a newly single woman partners up with an older man have all created challenges for women. In particular, more and more single women are living apart from their spouses — often a source of resentment for mothers.

This raises all kinds of issues for divorced women, who may have to contend with their ex-spouses' living arrangements and the divorce papers they will inevitably file.

"A lot of women want to believe that they are at the pinnacle of their careers and careers are what matters in the end, whether you are divorced or not," noted Dr. Rebecca Campbell, senior research associate at the American Association of University Women, which conducted the study. "But our research shows that it is also true that they feel they are a victim in a way that men do not."

A survey released last fall found that 62 percent of couples interviewed thought they did not feel "completely at ease" being the primary financial decision-maker in the lives of their partners. About 70 percent had been upset that their current partner's financial planning had taken precedence over theirs in the divorce proceedings.

Couples reported feeling resentful. A woman from Washington State said: "It was awful. He made a lot of money. I never made what he did. He was always in that mansion. Then, all of a sudden, the thing that he thought I earned became I earned as much as he did. He was just so happy. He had time, and the house he had built became mine to go back to whenever I wanted."

A divorced Bostonian said, "It made me miserable, to say the least."

That sentiment was echoed in interviews conducted with two-thirds of the 800 respondents.

The poll underscored the degree to which the divorce rate among women has doubled in the past 25 years. The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers found recently that half of all divorced women who had been living as married in 1980 had now become ex-husbands. Another study found that in 1997, three out of five divorcing women had taken out credit cards to pay legal fees — about the same as the proportion of married women who used credit cards to finance legal fees among new-married couples.

The new study found an alarming number of men who were either divorced themselves or who had remarried an ex-lover felt guilty and self-conscious about their finances.

======================================== SAMPLE 121 ========================================
Lion-man is a common theme in some traditional fairy tales, but what is it and how would it relate to a lion with a human soul? In this blog post we look at one of the best-known fairy tales from the 13th century: Léon the Lion-friend. With illustrations from an illuminated manuscript of Saint-Céline's Chronicle of the Lives of the Saints, and an examination of how this tale relates to a lion-man and his life, we'll start to see the meaning of the lion-man in this tale.

What is a Lion-man?

The term 'lion-man' has become popular in the past few years with people who want to understand the traditional conception of a lion. Many people have a bad reputation about being rude to tourists because of people calling them 'lion-men'. We're not saying people shouldn't call themselves lion-men but when you come to Scotland, you should learn to act properly! Instead of looking down upon the locals and being rude, why not go and see how they are in reality?

So why did Léon want to become a lion man? According to Saint-Céline's Chronicle he was made a 'honest knight' at the age of five from his father, and lived as a hermit at Saint-Marcel. This makes him one of the oldest lion-men known to have lived in Europe. In fact as the oldest living lion-man in Britain, he is often called 'the Last Lion-man' due to the fact that he was thought to have died a century ago.

What makes a lion-man?

While many modern lion-men would fall under the category of 'brave' or 'good-hearted', the term 'lion-man' is a much wider term, and encompasses everything from the famous King Arthur character, to an elephant wearing a man's suit, to a lion with human body and soul.

A lion's lion-man has a lion's strength, wisdom and courage; his mind is a lion's, his body is lion's, his spirit is lion's; his mind is a lion's, his heart is a lion's, his soul is lion's and his body is lion's. ~ St Célestine's Chronicle (1530)

In Scotland, the lion-man is almost always portrayed as having a tail instead of a mane. This has caused a lot of confusion about what a lion-man does, and more importantly is often misinterpreted by tourists as a real living Lion-man.

What is a Lion-man's life like?

Lion-man lives a very nomadic life, moving from place to place as needed. This is also where the term 'lion-man' falls under the broad category of being seen as a 'lion-man' by tourists when he lives nomadically for a period of time. Although he is considered a lion-man for his strength, wisdom and courage, the life of the lion-man can be quite similar to other wild animals, living on the edge of survival where survival is everything.

Lion-man is very cautious about strangers. He does not approach strangers directly, and generally avoids the area where other lions may live. He does approach strangers if the situation is a bit too dangerous (such as a predator or a flood). In those types of situations 'lion-man' will move away from the confrontation, avoiding being hurt or killed.

Why does lion-man exist?

Lion-man has a unique place in popular culture. There are lots of stories about lion-mans going out into a forest in dangerous situations to protect children. There have also been stories of lions being seen 'coming to aid' (usually in the form of a woman on a broomstick), often in the form of a mother-lion (pictured here).

There are two types of lion-person that can be found in the folk-tale. The first is the more common lion-man, while the second could be considered a hybrid beast.

The first is generally the lion-person we are used to seeing onscreen. The stories usually have the lion-man helping a father, mother or a daughter, and in the story of St. Césaire, he even helped a man who was drowning, before he could be drowned as well.

The lion-man in these stories has a certain character that often makes him stand out from other characters, like St. Césaire's father or the 'Lion-clowns' from the film. These stories often have quite a strong moral message which could be very hard for people to hear. One such story is the story about the young child, who was left alone in the forest of Fosse, only to discover the forest was full of lions, which were 'looking after their family'.

"It was the time of the week we were looking forward to, so we decided to try and go to the park.

"The security staff were very attentive and went way out of their way to ensure we had a safe trip."

Tina, who lives in New York with her family, bought her first roller coaster when she was two, but she says the experience at the park was a very different one.

She told local radio station WABC that one of the rides "smacked her down on the way down and she's in a fetal position."

The woman suffered a back injury and a broken nose as she fell to the ground.

"I was thinking to myself that a roller coaster is like any roller coaster - it goes from high to low," Tina said, "and in this one I was falling and you just feel so powerless and you don't know what's going to hit you."

An ambulance had to be called to the scene and the woman was treated at an emergency hospital before being released.

In a statement, The Walt Disney Company confirmed that it was not operating the ride at the time.

"An early morning maintenance team was on scene and it has since been closed for proper inspection," the statement read. "The safety and satisfaction of our guests is our top priority and this investigation continues."<|endoftext|>I've been reading "Echoing the Echo" by Richard Dreyfuss (one of my favorites!) for a couple of days and got curious how people with ADHD reacted to Dreyfuss' "My Brain" book.

It's about cognitive-behavioral therapy — basically a way of training people to do behaviors that aren't always conscious or deliberate. A lot of people with ADHD are self-help gurus as part of their jobs — so people with ADHD can easily become experts in their own self-improvements. But, I don't think a lot of people know about the fact that Dreyfuss is a chronic sufferer of ADHD himself. I didn't either. It's something I didn't expect until I started writing about it.


I like to think of myself as an honest-to-goodness, average human being and, after all, I've been through some terrible things (including being assaulted and hospitalized), so maybe I'm an example to myself. The same goes for Dreyfuss, according to Dreyfuss' website:

I have ADHD. For most of my life, that has been very tough to understand… But as I grew up, the diagnosis of my ADHD didn't seem that relevant. I didn't need people to tell me it was a problem. It was a problem that only got worse when I tried to manage it myself.

What was Dreyfuss thinking when he was working on this book about having his ADHD? I was surprised by a couple of answers. The first:

"I felt as though I were being judged. I was worried about how I'd be perceived by people, particularly my friends and family, if I spoke to them openly about my brain, my ADD, and how I was still having the same problems.

And,

"I think I was terrified of the stigma: the fear that I was going to turn to alcohol (and/or drugs) in order to ease my symptoms and keep the symptoms at bay.

How could I even live life with anxiety, depression, ADHD, anxiety, paranoia, and fear of my own brain? For me, that life was unbearable. I knew one day I'd need to leave that life behind.

The second:

I was angry that my symptoms weren't a blessing but a curse. How could they be a curse if I didn't know it? If I didn't have a mental health problem? If I wasn't a burden to the people around me? If they were merely symptoms of a life I didn't want to live?

I wanted to know how I could change my own life, not because I wanted to change my symptoms (because I knew those symptoms would only get worse… when I began to manage them on my own), but because I wanted help learning to manage them.

Dreyfuss' book also gives some examples of those that seem to respond well to cognitive-behavioral therapy.


Here, for example, is how Dreyfuss describes a client he worked with at a rehab clinic who had a high-functioning diagnosis but struggled with ADHD. On the outside Dreyfuss describes his client as shy and "an introvert." "I would see the client as a kind of quiet, timid soul that needed to be brought out of a shell of self-consciousness," he writes. "She didn't talk to people; she was so absorbed.
======================================== SAMPLE 123 ========================================
In May 1996, then-California Governor Pete Wilson announced his intention to set up a $6 million study in Oakland, California on the question of whether or not the Oakland school district was using its police to harass or intimidate its students with the aim of preventing students from wearing black face. "I'm concerned for the safety and protection of our students and the community," Wilson told the Oakland press. "We want to make sure everything within the district is following federal law, and we also want to make sure things don't escalate."

The Oakland City Council quickly approved the study, and in June the study began. In September the study released its results: Of the approximately 5,800 children with which they monitored disciplinary hearings, 6.7 percent were accused of engaging in behaviors that were offensive. Of those incidents, 6.5 percent were deemed "disrespectful," 7.9 percent were deemed "disrespectful but not offensive" and 9.2 percent were deemed "suspect."

Wilson was not satisfied. "What we're finding is a little bit unsettling for our community and my wife, because I think the findings paint a picture of us in a very bad light. And they paint a picture of us that we wish we weren't," he told reporters in July 1997. "The findings don't appear to include any reference of 'racial profiling.' In general we're finding a very low number of students, and those students, we're finding that they happen to be black." "If you really look around there, our community is probably the most racially diverse in the United States."

But if most of Wilson's "studies" were conducted at the most racially diverse school district in the United States with the fewest black students, is such a situation really that uncommon?

The answer is not a firm "yes," for a number of reasons.

The Oakland study was not a true experiment, and the fact that a study of racial harassment is necessary for the study itself was never stated. Even though the study was advertised as "scientific," Wilson insisted that, "If we were finding that a certain percentage of kids were engaging in behaviors that violated the guidelines that were in the guidelines—they were offensive acts and they were threatening—it would not necessarily qualify and lead me to do what I did."

The study also was not random, and the only students who appear to have been randomly selected were those most likely to exhibit harassment. Only 25 percent of the students who interacted with police are black, but the study's sampling was limited based on the assumption that such students would be the most likely to be harassed.

The result that black students are disproportionately targeted for abuse by the police is not a "surprising" conclusion to observers in the African American community.

Black students in Oakland are six times more likely to be victims of physical and/or sexual discrimination by Oakland's police than white students. In the most recent academic year, Black students had a rate of 15.8 harassment incidents per 1,000 students—three times the rate for White students. According to the most recent report by the Oakland Police Department, there were 1,972 cases of crime against people from Black and other communities. Of those 1,972 incidents, Black victims experienced an incidence rate of 449.2 incidents per 1,000 African Americans, a rate nearly three times that of White people, a rate that was twice the rate for Asian communities and four times the rate for Latinos in Oakland.

A "surprising" finding at best.

The racial profiling of Oakland police is not a new phenomenon. In January 2002, police in Oakland were accused of violating the civil rights of 16 Black youths by beating them so badly, one of them died. The victim, 17-year-old Darrick Walker, was arrested for allegedly being in possession of a stolen car. After being brought before an Oakland judge, Walker was put in the front seat of a police van. As the van drove down Market Street, Walker had to endure multiple assaults on his back and sides, including one kick to his head and a head butt, leaving him unconscious. When the van arrived at the police station, he was taken to the hospital in critical condition, where he died as a result of complications from the beating.

In an interview with CBS San Francisco reporter Mike Wallace, Officer Robert Rizzuti said he was "a little hurt" by the criticism his actions might seem like racial profiling. In that statement, he confirmed that he punched, kicked and threw the boy out of the police van because he "looked at [Rizzuti] in a certain manner, and he couldn't control this person who was looking in different and different directions."

For a study to be considered legitimate, we had to prove that it had the same validity as the other "studies." This is a dubious criterion for evaluating serious research, much less a study that is published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which had a

It is a beautiful time to be a soccer fan in America and for a lot of people, watching Neymar dribble, bend, and shoot is something like a dream come true. Many in soccer-crazed Europe are wondering just how in the world a guy known for winning every competition there could be playing in the World Cup for South America.

Not only could such comparisons be made, but a player like Neymar could bring a new dimension to the game for American soccer fans. Neymar's ability to shoot with his left foot is one that is sure to be a part of the game even if he is the player playing for Brazil.

American soccer fans also need to keep in mind that Neymar is 21 years old, thus a bit older than most American soccer players. If I had to pick a player who could revolutionize the game in the U.S., I would pick Neymar.

The U.S. is always going to have a large contingent of soccer-loving fans, like they did during the early 1990's. There are certain players (Chad Barrett) who bring an aura to a game that makes the game accessible for fans even if they don't support the team. There will always be a segment that will watch soccer and that part won't grow any smaller. With that said, there will always be the people who are always searching for a new way to watch the game, whether it is through technology, television, or a way to watch soccer with their favorite people.

It is not that I haven't heard or seen any American fans argue about the merits of Neymar. There are a couple of points I thought about while writing this article, which I want to add to the conversation:

Some people want to watch Neymar play because of his reputation, whereas other people think playing for Brazil is better; some people want to watch Neymar play because he can bring something new and exciting to the game; and some people think playing for Neymar is better because Neymar likes playing for Brazil.

All of these people have valid viewpoints, but one thing that is worth considering is how Neymar feels: Neymar plays for Brazil; Neymar wants to play for Brazil. What motivates a player to play for a team in which they don't really believe in? It's more than just being motivated by money (for better or worse). The U.S. is not going to have a problem paying Neymar (more on that in a minute.) That being said, it wouldn't be a surprise if Neymar decided to play for an MLS team because he wants to help the team reach greater heights. Some people would love to see them reach the final and make history as the first U.S. team to go all the way, but some would love to see them in the tournament.

"If Neymar does not play for Brazil, I don't believe he will enjoy any of the joys of an English Premier League club."

I am willing to bet that if there's one thing that keeps him up at night, it isn't Neymar's decision to stay or go to Brazil for the World Cup. It is Neymar's decision to play for Brazil. If he decides to play for Brazil, then yes, he will have to enjoy playing for an English Premier League team like Arsenal. Will he be a happy camper? Probably. Will he want to play for the USA on TV and for the other games throughout the World Cup? Probably no.

Here's an interesting point for you: Did you see the video of the last goal that Neymar scored against England? I didn't either, because it seemed so impossible to score in such a difficult environment. I wonder if the team is getting worried about whether or not Neymar will be able to play when the next World Cup rolls around?

There is also the possibility that the team isn't sure whether or not Neymar would be comfortable with a team that plays a similar style to the one in which he has spent his entire career. Many Americans don't realize that many players, especially those in the U.S. Men's National Team have left the team because it didn't fit their style of play. A guy like Eddie Johnson, who has been playing soccer his entire life but is not a natural striker, left the national team to play a more attacking style of soccer. He was successful. What will happen if Neymar decides to play for an American-style team with a different style of play? There is a good chance that he would be comfortable with that team, if only for the goal

BOULDER, Colo. — The University of Colorado says an online class offered with its College of Social Sciences and Humanities in April failed to meet the standards it has established to monitor its online classes.

"Colorado's online program has failed to meet University of Colorado standards," said university spokesman Ryan Huff. "We were disappointed to see the failure, but we need to make sure we can track all the courses properly going forward."

The course was offered by CU's Global Studies program and focused on a number of international issues from a student's perspective, according to a description posted on the website Ucscam.com.

The course was approved by the University of Colorado's Office of Faculty Development in November 2015.

The course, taught by a graduate student, received the highest grade out of five at an on-campus lecture and took two weeks to complete.

A university spokesperson said the course meets University of Colorado standards to ensure quality education is available.

The online portion of the course was a requirement for all undergraduate students entering the College of Social Sciences and Humanities and offered through the Social Sciences Education Center.

Undergraduates in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities may take a course for free through the Ucscam web site.

Courses accepted by CU are typically developed by undergraduate faculty and offered through the Social Sciences Education Center with approval from the College of Social Sciences and Humanities.<|endoftext|>In this episode we talk to the writer, director and producer of the new film, 'Saw IV'.

It's a sequel of sorts to the critically-acclaimed Saw series that is set in 1981 in Saw, Minnesota, USA (where we filmed at the end of November).

"I'd just worked with a lot of these guys on the movie 'The Guest' and they've been really encouraging me to make this one". In the film, the film director and the writer of the original Saw films, Paul W.S. Anderson and Mark Verheiden are back together again.

Saw IV will follow a new girl who works at the hospital - she's a medic. But she is very disturbed and goes into a trance whenever she sees a scary shape. When she sees a clown she gets freaked out and dies during an accident. The boy in the hospital is devastated and runs after her. When he goes to the carnival he finds a blood-soaked clown and discovers the killer is still there.

"This is a great film. We went for a very scary ending. And it wasn't a real twist. It's just something new where I think that it will bring in a new audience to our movies".

The trailer is here.

Our interview with Paul and Mark is here.

This film opens on 28th May. Check out the official site for more details and here for tickets for the UK.<|endoftext|>The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995

A man accused of murdering an ex-girlfriend with a hammer was shot in the back of the head after opening fire last week in his Brooklyn Heights apartment, cops said.

The man, identified by the police as 24-year-old David A. Nalang, took a hammer from his grandmother's house last week in the Brownsville neighborhood when the woman, who was visiting out of state for one day, tried to enter, sources said.

The man shot the woman in the chest three times, sources said.

Police said Nalang had a knife in his waistband when he was shot in the back of the head. Nalang got 10 stitches for the wound, and then he was driven to Jackson Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

"He had the knife and took it out, and was shooting at her from what witnesses told us," Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said at a press conference on Tuesday.

The woman was still in critical condition as of Tuesday.

Nalang was taken into custody in his grandmother's Long Island home Tuesday morning and was charged with murder and unlawful possession of a weapon.<|endoftext|>There's a lot going on when it comes to the new album by the band known as Tame Impala, The Dream Walker. There's the debut EP, the new music video, and a video from the band members. They also have an album coming out (not by Tame Impala, but with Warner Brothers/Universal) about a man who gets lost on his way to work.

The man he travels with is an angelic dude named James Ford, who is an artist, composer and visual artist who lives in California. In my mind, it's one of his best videos—and the one I saw when it debuted on my iPad last week—since his 2011 video "Dreams Come True" that featured John Cusack.

Ford's video, which was directed by his friend Jason Zada, sees Ford walk along a beach and through the streets of Southern California while looking confused about how he ended up there when he wakes up. He has a camera attached to his head that tracks the movements of his head to create this surrealistic video. He has a few close-ups, but he mostly relies on the movement of his own face to create these looks of confusion and disorientation.

The song is called "Let It Happen," and it features the same producer at the helm as on "Dreams Come True," Mark Ronson. While his work on that song is on a similar level, his songwriting can be so much more interesting, since they come from the perspective of many other emotions.

The way I saw it, Ford wrote the song after he read a story about James Ford, who has a severe head injury that kept him from working. He was also the lead singer of a band that broke up. In the story, he starts walking around and starts to get lost and he is then shown through the eyes of a camera that he was using. The song starts to unfold and we watch as this guy keeps searching for where he is and is searching for his family.

Eventually, Ford has "let it happen," as he says in the song. It's a song about how we can let what happened happen and can find happiness in it, with the help of a friend. It's also just such a good piece of sound. This new song with Ronson is a great combination of the two, with the electronic textures, the piano in the background and the music and synth tones to the vocals. It's a great song because it reminds me of "Wonderwall" and the new song is also just a wonderful piece of music to listen to when you're traveling on your own or have no idea of where you are.

It helps give the album an even more upbeat feel without sounding too uptight. Ford did some research on how James Ford's wife, Jill, has been able to get out of the house and make it out of the city to meet people who are willing to help her. That's where Ford came up with the idea for the song.

"Let It Happen" is a good time, a great song, and a fun intro for the Tame Impala album. You can hear more of it soon.<|endoftext|>The last-minute decision to bring forward the final game of the home-and-away season to Saturday has not been greeted with universal relief by the opposition.

A woman in California is suing the US state for allegedly forcing her to buy health insurance covering abortions, for which the state has not yet been found capable, because the federal healthcare system is overwhelmed with demand.

The case could spark a court challenge to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that everyone must buy "comprehensive" health insurance policy or pay a penalty until the law's repeal by 2017, legal experts say.

The lawsuit, to be heard Thursday, was filed by the unnamed plaintiff with the San Diego County Superior Court. The complaint says that the law forces the woman to pay for coverage for elective abortions, including in-vitro fertilization and sex-selection abortions, and for abortions performed because of the woman's gender or race.

SPONSORED

"The US government is effectively forcing California women to violate the principle of informed consent," the complaint reads.

The complaint also alleges that Planned Parenthood does not provide "informed consent" for patients seeking abortions, and that the woman knew that the insurance policy required her to buy abortion coverage when she registered for a state-run healthcare insurance exchange.

Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the suit should be dismissed on technicalities, asserting that it is not a health insurance plan but a separate entity exempt from the Affordable Care Act.

But lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union agreed that California's law, dubbed the Women's Right to Know Act, should be declared unconstitutional, and urged the state to repeal it before it risks setting a precedent that could force more states to follow suit.

"This is the first lawsuit we can think of that deals specifically with, in a state's case, a health plan as a kind of health plan and then requiring women to buy it if they have a pre-existing condition," said Anthony Daines, a staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project.

California's law took effect last year, and the lawsuit cites cases where other states have tried to get around Obamacare's requirements for everyone to buy health insurance, only to be struck down.

"This is not an issue about abortion insurance but about a mandate by the California legislature that the law be enforced," said ACLU lawyer Shannon Minter.

"We have to have the ability to ensure that women are treated properly, and that that takes care of their overall health insurance, and that in those circumstances that women are told what kinds of health care they can have access to and that they can't be discriminated against. That's what this law is about."

California's law requires health insurance plans to cover all medical procedures, even if they were not mandated by federal law. It also requires that they charge the same rate regardless of the patient's gender.

The law was approved by voters in November, but abortion rights supporters vowed to fight it in court before its implementation unless it was challenged as unconstitutional.

The UNICEF figures, compiled in the latest edition of its Global Report Card on Child Well-Being, show a 10 percentage increase in rates of suicide between 1999 and 2014 in the US, from 9.1 to 10.6 per 100,000 children aged between 0 and 14. The European average was 6.6 suicide per 100,000 aged 5-14, which puts the US well above the EU average and other developed countries from the US.

But there was big variation between regions, with a 10 percentage increase in the rate of suicides amongst people aged 15-54 in the US, from 4.2 to 5.3, compared to 5 per 100,000 in Canada, 6.3 per 100,000 in England and Wales, 7.1 in Sweden and 10.9 in Finland.

The authors point out that suicide can affect people of all ages, making it more likely that a large proportion of the increase in suicidal behaviour in the US is from suicide among children under the age of 25.

In addition, they note that the US is one of just four countries where the incidence of suicidal thoughts among children between the ages of 12 and 24 has increased between 2000 and 2014, and the other three are South Africa, Thailand and Zimbabwe.

"We know from the past that countries with high adolescent suicide rates like the US and the UK are generally less successful at reaching the targets set by the United Nations," said Susan Hockstein, the lead author of the report. "It is critical to look closely at suicide in all its forms, including young people's thoughts and feelings and act as an important reminder to all governments to take actions at the policy, sector and health-policy levels to tackle them."

Suicide, in general, is the third leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to

"The truth is there's just one way the world works, and it's not how we'd like it to work," says the character of Dredd.

Well, there is a way to find out the way is different and it's not by reading a bunch of books on the internet and then coming to this one website, or reading The New York Times, and then going, "Oohh, I like this movie. I really think this is the best way to do this."

It might be to take a look at the film.

The film takes about ten hours to watch on video. (Though it doesn't have the same kind of overlong movie that, say, The Matrix does.) But on top of all that is the fact that when you start a game, if you want to do that, your character gets stuck in a level. So how do we avoid that scenario? Well, in the film, Dredd is stuck in a level because he's on parole. But not all levels are like this. The film shows us a very detailed version of a level, which is called a mission. It's made up of five missions, and each one is kind of a puzzle in itself. So if we're going to solve the mission we need to know what the puzzle is. It would've been nice if that level had been at least somewhat open.

The film also shows us other types of levels. And one of them is one called The Pit, and, I remember watching it with Dredd and talking about it. In this mission you're moving two barrels by shooting them. So you move your barrel, and then you shoot your first barrel to move your barrel one place. And then you do it again. If you do it all five times, it'll move one way, three places, and four places. You have to stop this at five places and you can do it all five times. It's really simple. But it took me 30 seconds to figure out how to do it. And that took me a while to figure out.

You get more information by watching it, but if you want to get a little bit more you can read Dredd's character's memoir. Which is called The World's Final Solution. If you read that, it'll explain how this city came to be at the center of everything. It will explain how it got its name, The World. Because for a while, one city was the center of the world, and then it got divided, and they decided the rest should just get out somewhere else. This isn't a film where anything is explained in an hour and a half, but it is very clear.

So, if somebody wants to know how the world works, it won't take you that long. You don't have to read anything. All you have to do is sit down and watch.

[Note: For the record, I'm an English major. I've been taking a computer graphics class called "Animation Technology" in college, which is like a really good class, but it's not exactly film history, so I feel free not to compare anything to The World's Final Solution, or The Matrix, or any other of the other films about The World.]<|endoftext|>From Baka-Tsuki

Part 1 [ edit ]

At the gates of Gensokyo, people came in, going in every which way. Some were in large groups, some on foot, some on horseback. As they came in, there would be a great crowd. However, they all looked different. One side was entirely white. The other side was entirely black.

Even as they came in, the crowd's density didn't change a bit.

If you were to call Gensokyo a place made up of a large group of people, then it certainly was a place filled with people.

The person who stood on the wall was standing behind them, and it was as if she had always been there. Her hair was dyed black, so she definitely was one of the crowd of black people.

======================================== SAMPLE 130 ========================================
In the past couple of games, I have been very interested in using my opponent's actions as a way to play around their abilities. For instance, if they have a special character ability that takes effect once a certain move hits or if they have the Power Up card, I can take advantage of that by having another character attack their weaker character to take out their weaker character for free. This isn't always a great strategy, but is always great when it's a good one.

So what's a good strategy? This is what I'm interested in the most. We see this all the time in fighting games. When a character attacks (or blocks) the opponent, they'll move in one direction or the other (most of the time). The player tries to figure out what their opponent is going to do in that particular move, and then attacks them accordingly. Since so much of the time these moves are predictable, players will often go for a character who does a lot of these attacks. This allows them to have a lot of options, and thus a lot of success in matches.

This is all about the timing of that move, and there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, you must play with your timing. You can always do your character with the most efficient timing for the move, but there is a lot, lot more to it than just that. In this case, you need to think at a much deeper level. Let's say your opponent uses an attack during blockstring. A lot of times, you see characters block in a particular order. This means they are putting their opponent in situations that have a decent chance of success. They block the attack then block a similar attack. This means the attack that was blocked is almost certain to be your opponent's next move, which is great for you.

However, if they use this same attack again, you could block that next attack and block something else, then start throwing blocks the other way because you still block in the same order from previous blocks. But this attack could be so good, that you don't worry. When your opponent blocks the first time, they will be looking for a way to make your block-throw order useless in the future so that you can simply block again. If it's too good for them, you might block a different attack, throw a block in between, and then block it again before they ever start throwing a normal block. Then you block the second attack, do a throw, get a block in between, throw that one, and then throw the next one for another throw block. When both attacks end with a throw, they'll switch from blocking to throw before the end of the attack, letting you get out of the way. When the throw block is blocked, you can continue to use the throw block and only the throw will block it.

So what about the player's actions? First it's important to understand how they interact with the other. When one player blocks a move, it means not every action is done by that character. In this case it's possible to hit the block string with a throw because the opponent can't make a throw block of their own, but you can always block a throw as well for the same reasons. Let's say you block the special move and then block a throw. If your opponent blocks the special move then again then throws a block in-between, they will be blocking with you, the defender, but they will also be blocking the move so you can get a throw block. So now you're being blocked by your opponent. You can do a normal block and then use a throw. This will allow you to prevent your opponent from being hit, but your opponent can also use their throw to get to you. Since your opponent will always be blocking an action, they could always block a different move and avoid the throw block because they don't have the throw block to stop the move. I'll get into the timing of the special and throw attacks later in the guide, but let's look at this in more detail.

If you block an attack, then throw an attack, your opponent will block that move. Your opponent might not block that move since that move wasn't very good, and the next attack will hit them while they're blocked, giving you some control over what your opponent chooses to do. If they block all three, then you will be able to get an extra throw block which will allow you to be safe from the special move the entire round while being able to get that extra throw block. When all the special moves are blocked, your opponent will still be blocking at the top of the screen, but now they won't be blocking the attack (as in, all the rest of the special moves are blocked). If you block all three special moves then your opponent will still be blocking the attack, but each special is blocked separately and you will still be able to get a throw block. After the special moves are blocked, you will need to throw another throw

The White House is offering an olive branch to North Korea today, as part of an effort to convince the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions in favor of a negotiated end to the nuclear crisis it has been locked in for years.

The North was warned yesterday that the White House was open to talks — but only after Pyongyang's next round of weapons testing expires in December.

But the White House's latest offering, which is being called a "roadmap," was immediately branded a "tactical retreat" by the North.

In a statement released by North Korea's news agency Korea Central News Agency, Pyongyang said the White House had "abandoned its policy of engagement and negotiation" with Kim Jong Un's regime.

Kim blamed the South for setting "a destructive course that seriously jeopardizes the peace on the Korean peninsula and the peace and security of the nations in the region by igniting a military confrontation."

"The United States should not make any mistake that is allowed to provoke a war by reckless provocation of the nuclear issue," Kim said.

Kim said the United States had to halt its provocations immediately as "the time of opening a new front in a nuclear and missile confrontation had come." He called the new White House policy "a U.S. imperialists' policy of war."

Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have been making a concerted push to restart stalled negotiations over North Korea's stalled nuclear program, in an effort to avoid that situation escalating into an all-out war.

North Korea conducted five nuclear tests in 2016 and has been threatening to go nuclear before a ruling party congress later this month, though experts agree it can't yet miniaturize a nuclear warhead sufficiently for it to be deployed on a missile.

The U.S. and South Korea, as well other nations in the region, have been considering a new round of U.N. sanctions for years, but have yet to implement them. North Korea has responded in kind by launching dozens of missiles off its coasts — in defiance of U.N. pressure to stop its weapons program.

Kim's statement on North Korea appeared to give credence to those who argued the most effective way to change North Korea's behavior would be through economic pressure.

President Trump tweeted Friday that the United States and China are working on "a plan to solve the North Korea problem."

But even as the White House pushes for a deal, a key U.S. military assessment of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities has come under increased scrutiny.

The Pentagon's report this week concluded that only two North Korean strategic bombers could pose a threat to the United States, while the other four could be used to launch a nuclear strike against the United States and its allies.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer has rejected the assessments, saying the White House has "no reason" to doubt the Pentagon's assessments.

Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program has long been a major concern in Washington and has fueled concern on Capitol Hill that a miscalculation could spark a global conflagration.

U.S. officials have repeatedly warned Pyongyang that it would face serious consequences if it threatens to use a nuclear bomb against the United States or its allies. Even so, North Korea repeatedly insists it needs a nuclear capability to counter what it says are U.S. nuclear encroachments near its territory.

"We are not seeking war, we are not seeking confrontation," President Trump told reporters during his Asia tour this week. "We are not looking to the worst. But the best thing we can do is get along with the rest of the world and let them solve the problem."

In recent years the White House has taken a harder line on North Korea, taking a harder line with China and taking a firmer line with North Korea's neighbors, Japan, South Korea and Russia.<|endoftext|>It's probably not news that most of the world's populations now live in cities, for the biggest chunk of the world's population is concentrated in cities.

A look at some of the world's leading cities by housing density puts the issue in context.

In the above map, density in units per km² (which takes into account the urban structure but omits the size of the city) is listed along the horizontal axis to indicate the number of residents living in each city, and the number of square kilometers within each city taken along the vertical axis to signify the land area. The most densely populated cities are in Asia and northern Africa.

A few notes: This is an urban area density calculation using the United Nations' Demographic and Health Surveys. Land area not included.

We can go further and compare the density of different city types to see how different urban densities compare to the surrounding areas. These densities have been derived from 2010 UN statistics.

When we talk to parents and guardians about the impact of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on their children, many feel like they're just doing a public service by informing parents. Many of our readers share the same opinion; we are well aware of the impact of ASD on people, but there are those who want to see us silenced.

What they do not realize is that, in a court and out of court, the parents and guardians of people with ASD have the legal right to present their best case. It is the responsibility of the court system to present the facts against every argument put forth by the parents and guardians to the judge; this is the ultimate evaluation of the children for their development. These are not merely facts about the children, but facts about a person's character, and whether or not it should be taken into consideration in deciding whether or not autism is to be treated as a disability when a person qualifies.

This is a very personal and extremely dangerous game to play with children. Autism is a mental illness that affects every aspect of their lives — not just behavior but personality and emotions all throughout. Children with ASD are no different from anyone else, but are more frequently diagnosed under the same umbrella label than any other.

Not only do some children have ASD because of severe brain impairment, but these same children have other conditions also contributing to the diagnosis of ASD. It happens to a child every day. A child will be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder for behaviors associated with autism, even if they have the same diagnosis — as a parent, it's your responsibility to look after these children like you would any other child.

Let's consider a real life example. A few years ago, a mother came to us saying, "I have a 9-year-old autistic son. I would love some help. I have had difficulty with him ever since he started preschool at 3 years old."

Here is what I told her.

"Dear Ms. Smith, Please do not be angry at other parents in our community who do not like your treatment of your son. They are using their right to raise the issue without your consent because they do not understand how you raise your son. He did start preschool when he was 3 years old and is completely on target. The diagnosis that many other kids with ASD get is more likely to be a result of lack of insight than anything related to autism. As such, it would be a disservice to him and to all of us with autism if you kept your son's diagnosis out of court. When you go to court, ask the judge to consider the information put forth by you and the children you have raised."

What's next for this case?

The mother has no choice but to continue to pursue a lawsuit. Her son has not been diagnosed as having ASD. As he grows, he is going to be diagnosed with Autism. In the end, the diagnosis will be correct, but it has been used against her. This was just one mother who contacted us. There are thousands who do not understand how they can be held responsible for raising their children. This case is far from over. Your role is clear; you must advocate on behalf of every child with ASD, and do everything in your power to protect your son's rights.

I hope this has been helpful and informative. I can also tell you that I had a son who was diagnosed with ASD. I felt I let him down and the diagnosis was damaging both mentally and emotionally. My son is not here anymore, no longer alive. I can only imagine what a terrible thing that is, and am thankful I never had to experience it.

My advice is to educate yourself about the diagnosis of ADHD, and how it affects children, the parents and the court. It is a crucial time for autistic families of any age, and for all people. The future of the future of our country, and the future of our children, depends on our ability to protect them. This is not easy work, and there are many hurdles, but we must ensure that everyone is aware of the risks, and that the needs of their children are always considered.

If you would like more information on how you can protect and educate your child about the potential dangers of being labeled as autistic, there is now a free webinar to help you get started.

A man wearing an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset has been seen wandering around a park in New York City for about an hour. The man was carrying an orange chair similar to the one seen in Star Trek, and when he reached a certain spot in the room, the lights would blink and his virtual vision would turn into that of an actual person sitting in the chair. People were able to see that the guy had no eyes and therefore could move around the room with no problems, according to The Washington Post.

A security guard told CBS New York that he saw the man wandering around for about 15 minutes, but was worried that he would get into trouble.

Police officers were seen taking notes with their smartphones.

The person was able to interact with people by turning his virtual vision into real life. The VR tech is expected to be released in a new prototype in the spring.

It's supposed to be a way for lawmakers to give "legislation that will better protect men from being unfairly charged with rape or other sexual assault."

And what could possibly be wrong with this? If men get charged with rape and then exonerated, can't they get a lot of money from the courts? Sure, if men get paid and convicted of rape too often, we should give them some money, right?

Well, not so fast, feminists.

The bill in question allows men to sue women who have been raped, in the same way that they can sue men who have allegedly impregnated that woman.

"If there's an allegation that a woman was raped by a man, and the man goes to court and has his day in court, the man can seek money from that woman for damages," Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) stated on the House floor in early November.

This, of course, is a gross injustice. It's not only a violation of the Equal Rights Amendment of the Constitution, it's also an attack on the Constitution itself.

Here's what the Constitution says:

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

This means that men and women may, under certain circumstances, sue one another for damages. These circumstances can be as general as a woman is accused of adultery, or as specific as if a man was beaten by a wife.

The problem with the bill is that it doesn't go after rapists. It goes after women who have been raped, and it gives the accused no rights at all. It says, "If a man says you raped him, he can get money from you, but you can't do anything about it."

That is completely ridiculous. Women do get raped sometimes, although this is largely due to men failing to use condoms. If your husband has been abusing you, even if he has a condom, you can still stop unwanted intercourse — you just have to talk to a legal lawyer and make sure you have an agreement in place.

There have been a small number of cases of women getting raped in cases in which both partners were drunk — the legal line between consensual and nonconsensual sex can be blurred. It remains a problem that is most often blamed on guys who can't resist.

Still, women are not protected by laws like the "Mens Rights" bill. In one lawsuit, former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was convicted of three felonies, all stemming from his attack on an unconscious and intoxicated woman outside of a fraternity party. Though a jury only sentenced him to six months in jail, he was only given five, because prosecutors recommended a longer sentence for the felony sexual assault charge that would have carried a maximum of 14 years in prison.

This is not at all what the U.S. Supreme Court says should happen in rape cases. In 1989, the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Turner v. Turner established that "clear and convincing evidence" is required to prove that a person has been raped.

The problem with this is that, in cases such as Turner v. Turner, there really isn't any proof about the guilt of either party. They never had sex and could have stopped after a few moments, even in the worst, most drunken circumstances imaginable.

The high court has, for decades, required "clear and convincing evidence" in rape cases, which is very specific. To meet that requirement on Turner's rape case, the victim's statements and physical evidence

This is a very easy-to-use script to make your favorite sites load faster while visiting them and not slowing down page performance at all.

Installation

For this script you will need python 2.7 or more recent version and imagemagick installed on your system. You can get it from here.

You can find the script in github here. There is also a zip compressed version here.

This script includes several modules that can be configured from the options page.

If you are new to python you might want to read the python documentation to get comfortable with it.

Configuration

The following settings make the setup of the script a bit more flexible:

For each image file you want the script to load, set the path as the image filename. The script will look for an image file in the path and if it can't find it, then a 404 error will be returned. If you would like the script to search for images with certain extension ( .png vs .jpg ) you can specify it as options first as a list and then use it as an argument (e.g. -f path/to/image.png -w 500 ). If you also wish to search for images with specific name, just use that as an argument instead of -f (e.g. -e path/to/image.png -p name ). If you don't really care about that, just leave this option off. If you have images hosted on imgur you can specify that you want to only look for images hosted on the same server (e.g. -s server -p ip ). The rest is just optional.

If you only want to find files to replace old ones on your server, then just specify a comma separated list.

Configuration options can be changed using the options page.

Usage

Simply run python load-image.py for the first time. The script will look for images inside the current folder and will then try to load the first one.

After loading a image the script will display the page content as if it had been served from a faster server. The page will load faster and the performance will be more stable for a while.

If the server can't load the original image, you can try to load a file that you're not on the web server with. For example it can load a PNG or jpg instead of a jpeg/jpg one.

If the image can't be loaded because it was uploaded to imgur, you can try to load a file that you're not on the web server with. For example it can load an .jpg instead of a jpeg/jpg one.

If the page doesn't load properly because of the above reasons, you can try to load a small test page and see if you can see any visual changes in your page.

Finally, if the page is slow to download, you can try to change the path on the options page.

To get rid of the page completely, you can also use the –delete option.

Limitations<|endoftext|>We have a couple of surprises up our sleeves. Let's begin with the new set of cards coming in a few days.

Frenzied Goblin – 5/6

Ravaged Gourmet has been revealed as a common. It may be a cute little goblin, but he really doesn't do too much for us. He doesn't pump our army, he doesn't draw us extra cards, and he doesn't even trigger our Goblin Welder. What's more, one can only activate him on their first turn. So, I guess there's a place for him in a mono-green mill deck.

Nettle Drone – 4/4

Another common has been revealed, and he's no slouch. His ability triggers when any creature you control would deal damage to a player. Since these are creatures that deal damage to players, it makes sense that these two new commons will get used in mill decks as well.

Mortivore's Best Friend – 4/2

A 3/1 is not impressive, but it's not bad either. The downside for this minion is that he has an ability that's limited to only creatures that block that player. Still, a good creature for mill decks.

Boulderfist Ogre – 5/6

A 6/6 is a lot to pay, but this thing can get it done. Like our goblin, he doesn't really draw us cards, but he does take damage. There is one major downside that comes with any 6/6 creature: he is unable to block creatures that have trample. And, with most mills now featuring Trample, he's not going to be on our side. Nevertheless, he's a threat every turn he stays in play. A 3/5 for 5 is still a decent card and, like Frenzied Goblin, will be useful

The "No More Heroes Project" that started by GigaOm in 2005 is already over.

This year, the project was closed and GigaOm closed down its website that was hosting a collection of fan-made projects, including games, animated films, and other projects.

The creator of the project GigaOm, a company called Visceral, sent their condolences to the people who worked on it over the years.

"I have known and loved a few of the staff over the years, and I can say this: the No More Heroes team was the biggest family of creative minds I have ever been a part of, and our friendship has been irrevocably changed. It has been a blessing, a curse, an amazing time. You will forever be in my heart," the company wrote in a statement.

The project had a number of developers including Alex Proyas and Brian Martel.

Other notable games that participated include the "GTA: San Andreas", "Mafia II": A City Live", "Massachusetts SIS," "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 1," "Portal 2," "Half-Life 2: Lost Coast," "Halo: Reach" and "Final Fantasy XIII." Games like "Dirt 3: Resurrection," "Battlefield 3," "Mafia 2: Assassin's Edition" were also released.

The developer said that some creators of the project "had an incredible life ahead of them, and some unfortunately did not make it."<|endoftext|>A report released over the weekend in the Chicago Tribune reveals how the city of Chicago spent millions on a private criminal defense law firm to represent accused Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke in a case that led the federal government to launch a civil rights investigation into use of force by Chicago police.

The Chicago Tribune reports that from 2014 to 2016, the city spent on average $2.5 million every year on a private law firm "that has worked to protect public employees" from possible discrimination suits. Most of that money went to one law firm — the Chicago firm of Covington & Burling — which was founded in 1871 and counts former U.S. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Attorney General Eric Holder and current Secretary of State John Kerry among its clients.

In addition, the Tribune reports that Van Dyke's legal team had a salary of $350,000 per year and was paid $2 million by the city, up to $2 million for overtime, and that Van Dyke had paid an additional $300,000 to the Chicago firm of Pomerantz & O'Connell.

The Tribune notes:

The lawsuit filed Jan. 5, 2016 in U.S. District Court in Chicago alleges that Van Dyke unlawfully shot a 24-year-old in a wheelchair — a man who appeared to be complying with Van Dyke when the officer opened fire and killed him — with a Taser in 2014. Van Dyke claims the Taser malfunctioned and the man was shot by police with his own gun, the lawsuit alleges.

The Tribune reports that a judge in Cook County Circuit Court, which hears wrongful-death lawsuits, is weighing whether Van Dyke can be tried separately from the lawsuit filed by the family of Laquan McDonald, the black teenager fatally shot by the black officer in 2015.

In an interview over the weekend, Chicago-based civil rights attorney Craig Futterman described Van Dyke's legal team as "the tip of the iceberg — not the full iceberg." He added that he "can't think of any other situation where you would have a private law firm fighting a lawsuit and representing the city."

As reported by The Daily Caller News Foundation earlier this year, both the FBI and U.S Department of Justice have launched investigations into the practices of the Chicago Police Department and are seeking to figure out "whether Chicago police are violating the Constitution with regards to their use of deadly force."

Now, with a new robotic submarine, you'll finally find out.

The ROV-II, or remotely operated vehicle I or ROV II, is being prepared for its first field test in the Cleveland area, the U.S. Department of the Navy announced Wednesday.

The ROV-II is an exosuit that's designed so that it can be launched and retrieved by an underwater mine or an autonomous underwater vehicle. (The technology, developed by researchers at UMass Amherst and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, is also being used by the U.S. Marines for search and rescue.) It has a battery life of around 15 hours and can survive in water depths of up to 500 feet.

The ROV II will come from underwater mine defense systems company R3D. The government will pay R3D approximately $3 million to develop and deploy

"You'd have to be blind not to see the similarities."

That was the verdict of a former state trooper whose recent article, "I Can't Hear My Nausea" and its response from Taser International (TASER for short), sparked debate and debate about both.

"It was very simple," said Steve Hirschhorn, author of "I Can't Hear My Nausea: A Former State Trooper's Story of PTSD, Mental Illness, Taser, and Politics."

"This was a problem that could have easily been fixed. Tasers use one of the most effective and nonlethal weapons to incapacitate a person. They're very precise. However, there's another way of incapacitating people – one that uses pain, fear, and trauma to incapacitate them."

The company has taken heat for the use of a chemical agent that can cause temporary paralysis and even death when deployed inappropriately, according to Hirschhorn's article.

His article focused on a 2013 incident involving New York State Trooper Anthony Bologna, who was hit by pepper spray while trying to arrest an elderly woman because she refused to stop using a walker while sitting in her car.

The woman, who Hirschhorn referred to as "Mary," had been in New York City the week before the confrontation, where she was found mentally unfit to get on a subway. That prompted law enforcement officials to find her a hotel room and give her a night-stand to use as a bed, where they then realized she was still acting erratically.

Mary refused to get off her walker after being hit with the pepper spray.

Bologna, who had already lost his hearing and nose, was sprayed in the face a second time and began vomiting. He was placed into a spinal immobilization belt.

He wasn't breathing on his own – his helmet was off due to the pepper spray – and was in cardiac arrest. He was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was declared brain dead after being declared brain-dead, according to the New York Post.

Tasers in the hands of trained officers "can be effective," Hirschhorn conceded, but "they may not be effective enough, and that seems to be something that this case illustrates."

Hirschhorn is no stranger to litigation himself. In 2014, he sued the state of Massachusetts for failing to provide a sufficient level for public servants to rest while they were on duty.

"Our system is set up so that if you are on the road and you stop, you do not have a rest stop. There is no way to stop," the chief judge of Massachusetts Federal District Court William H. Pauley Jr., wrote at the time. "That is why the statute makes no provision for such a stop."

This article previously stated the state of Rhode Island had banned the purchase and use of Tasers by law enforcement. The Rhode Island State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<|endoftext|>This year will mark the 100th anniversary of the first successful manned launch of men on the International Space Station (ISS) by Soviet cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko in April 1963.

Kornienko was a legendary Russian fighter pilot who came to Earth on November 7, 1944, from a place known as the Soviet Union (USSR) in his fighter plane known as Tupolev Tu-16. He became a hero in Russia because of his achievements with the Sukhoi Su-6 and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal.

Kornienko is known for his remarkable achievement that he managed to fly from the planet Earth to Mars in one orbit for a distance of about 3,600 km.

His remarkable feat is described in the book, '100 Years – A Journey to the Moon and Back – by Yuri Gagarin and Alan Bean', published in 1959.

"For an extraordinary spaceflight, he left the Earth almost four times more frequently than it returned. He arrived at the Red Planet in a record four-day space crossing, and left in a rocket three weeks later."

On his flight from Earth to Mars Kornienko was accompanied by Yuri Gagarin. Kornienko had previously done another remarkable flight in the early hours of July 12,1953, from the planet Earth to Venus, the first space flight by a human which went for an incredible distance of more than 25,000 km. He was the only man to fly into outer space and back as a passenger.

NASA has selected Kornienko for the first ever human return to the Moon. However, it will be a bit different for him than it was with Gagarin.

Unlike Soviet space travel, U.S. space exploration is completely funded by the public sector with the assistance of private industries and commercial enterprises.

However, American human spaceflight is no picnic either. The United States has had a long

"You say that you were told not to use this method of transport. Well, if you are so concerned about being used as a tool by the enemy, you might as well use that method to get to it yourself."

"Ugh, fuck that guy. He's annoying."

I heard Aya complaining as I walked with Ria.

The two of us were currently inside the ship that had sunk.

In the meantime, it had already taken quite a while for us to reach the location.

"And we arrived."

Laughing evilly, Aya called out as she took off her helmet. She was still wearing her helmet, but that mask was no longer floating. Her face had turned into a serious expression.

"This, are you a goddess or something? What are these eyes of yours? And, you must be one too, right?"

The girl that was standing there had beautiful silver hair that was waving in the wind. Her face looked quite sharp, but her eyes were also sharp.

"If you are a goddess, then you should just let your guard down a little. Just because you are strong enough to defeat me, does not mean you are good at taking care of your own pride."

When Aya said that, I looked over to the girl and thought over what she said.

It certainly looked like a goddess. Her eyes were sharp, and she had white skin and a slender body. But I just couldn't understand.

However, it does not matter.

That's because this is an important fight.

"You see, it is as you said, you have come here. Since you know us, then your strength should have increased. Because we come together to help others, we are comrades. This is how you should treat us as comrades, right?"

"Uuu, really? Thank you very much."

After that short talk, I was able to regain my strength, but not the confidence that I had before. I still felt bad at saying that I was a god. It seemed that the goddess just happened to feel the same way.

In addition, she is really interesting.

"Well then, shall we go back now?"

"Yeah."

After hearing me say that, she smiled.

I did not have any confidence in my own strength.

However, after coming to this world, it seemed like these two people were strong.

They are probably stronger than me.

After a short conversation, we returned to the town. At this rate, the search for other survivors should get easier.

Although it was not as simple as it was in the past, the world was different.

The people on the surface had weapons, and they wore armor. But unlike some games, all the monsters here were weak!

"There are a lot of monsters over there. This place is dangerous, so we shouldn't go to the other side until the search for survivors is over."

I said to Aya.

"But I am tired. This is where I came. We have to search for survivors."

"You are a girl, right? Aya. Aya, are you alright?"

"It's fine. I am used to fighting a lot."

While she was nodding to her sister, she answered my question by using her finger.

I looked, but it seemed like Aya really was just like she looked.

The armor that she was wearing was so light. It gave her a beautiful feel, and it was as if she was wearing nothing more than that. I couldn't even see her face well. It was almost like seeing her for the first time.

And that look definitely did not mean that Aya was in pain. Rather, I thought it seemed rather refreshing.

After I checked the time, I asked Aya about the quest.

"There was a quest you were supposed to do, right? Tell me about it."

Aya said with a refreshed face.

"I was told that I should go to the forest in the south-west direction, and collect the monsters that are around it. If I do not follow that method, the monsters that are around might become stronger."

"Ahh, that is right. Let's hurry up, Aya."

After saying all that that she could, she disappeared from my view.

The moment Aya disappeared, I was hit with a feeling that made me want to get down from the ship. I heard the voices of Aya.

"That's right. You should go and fight. We will return after we save everyone on the boat."

"It seems that it is the opposite of what you were told. Let's go to investigate first. It is going to

"There's a lot of concern that it isn't good enough. The police need to be given the power of the purse," said Mike Thompson, a lawyer who represents the victims.

"What's wrong with giving law enforcement the power in these types of cases? When the police do it right, it brings a feeling of security. And when they do it wrong, it's just another avenue for corruption or abuse."

After the release of a series of undercover sting videos in 2009, police began carrying tasers, stun guns and police scanners. Mr. Thompson said the problem is that the police have become less accountable.

He said he has seen hundreds of cases where victims said they had not been contacted by police or had charges dropped.

"In this case, we've seen three people," Mr. Thompson said. "If the city wanted to address the needs of victims and to deter these crimes, it could do a lot to improve the way these crime scenes are handled."

There are no reliable national data on police use of tasers. In Minnesota, which requires all officers on the road to carry them, tasers have helped reduce assaults by 38 percent in four years, according to statistics released by the state police.

The Justice Department is also looking at tasers and their potential for abuse — and it is considering whether to require departments with certain large groups to provide data on their use so that Congress can assess whether tasers and other devices are being properly deployed.

Last year, the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services released a report that said in several cities with large numbers of black residents, black residents were disproportionately subjected to tased or other less-than-lethal force. The report came after a civil rights lawsuit in Baltimore in 2008 brought against police for its use of tasers in the city's Central Park area.

"If law enforcement agencies aren't careful with the use of the Taser, it could have a disproportionate impact," Kenneth D. Wolfe Jr., the attorney for the plaintiffs in the Baltimore civil rights lawsuit, said in an interview.

Ms. Taylor said that while the tasing incident may not appear to be typical, he said it was a prime example of a pattern of excessive use.

"Police have a responsibility to protect all of their citizens," he said. "They cannot be putting their hands on people unnecessarily."

The American Civil Liberties Union has opposed the use of tasers, saying they can cause the same sort of pain and suffering as other devices. They are also prone to jamming and have the potential to paralyze people, said the group's general counsel, Christopher J. Dunn.

The taser's inventor, Dr. Robert J. Heirens of the University of North Dakota, found that stun guns made officers more calm by decreasing the likelihood of a person reaching for something, which leads them to retreat quickly. But some of Dr. Heirens's research studies have been criticized because of methodological flaws that could lead to an unintended increase in use, or a decrease if officers are instructed to avoid using it.

"Heirens taser is much more of a blunt instrument than the electric stun gun," said John R. Lumpkin, who was a University of North Dakota professor until last fall when he left the university to become director of the state's Office of Policy and Research, which oversees tasers.

Dr. Lumpkin recalled his studies in which he was told officers would have to take control of situations when trying to subdue a violent suspect by using a taser. "That has to be done by trained officers with the appropriate training and the appropriate training," he said.

Mr. Thompson, the lawyer, said that in his 13 years practicing law, he had seen many of the taser cases that his clients had filed. He had yet to see a taser use that he deemed justified.

He was among the lawyers who helped set off the 2010 case, and says that when he first heard of it, he thought it was an isolated situation. "We got together and looked into it one by one, and all we did was take it a step further and say this is what's going on," Mr. Thompson said. "It becomes apparent that this is a pattern."

Last year, after the Justice Department released a report on the Baltimore case, Mr. Thompson said he thought
======================================== SAMPLE 139 ========================================
I have an issue where the user can only use the mouse in a specific manner, but not with the arrow keys, such that it appears to be a keyboard issue. This is most pronounced when a user wants to use the up, down, left, right, enter, backspace, backspace, home, delete keys with the arrow keys instead of the mouse.


I have been using a Dell laptop with the following configuration (which should be standard on most):


-Windows 7 Home Premium 64bits

-Intel Core M 5Y30

-8 GB RAM

-1TB HDD

-Dell Wireless Keyboard with Bluetooth

-Dell Wireless Mouse with Bluetooth


This is a common configuration on all laptops sold to the general public today. As far as I can tell, this is the only configuration where I can't use the arrow keys with my mouse. And this seems to be a common problem with the keyboard, and not a specific problem with the mouse. I have verified this for both Dell and Microsoft systems.


In Windows 7, at the point where I was able to use the arrow keys with the mouse, there appeared a little mouse cursor over the left thumbpad, which I used by default to click. But at the point where I was able to use the arrow keys with the mouse, the cursor was gone. I have tried rebooting, and this issue appears to be in effect even before rebooting.


I have noticed this issue in other recent versions of Windows as well, including Windows 10. I tried all kinds of fixes on both my Dell and Microsoft machines that seemed to temporarily fix the issue. I still get the same problem when using my mouse to click, and can't reliably use keyboard commands with the keyboard. For example, clicking the left mouse button on my mouse still seems to bring up the Windows key and the option to right-click.


I'm trying to use my mouse to select text, but it will only select text within 10 lines of the current selection if the cursor is on the left side of the text when I type the letter. Other times the selection appears within the existing selection. I tried everything I can think of on both my Dell and Microsoft machines with little or no success, on both systems. No other solutions seem to work either. Is there anything I can look for here? Anyone else know of anything?

Microsoft is working on these issues.

If you are experiencing these problems, the following steps can help you. Please follow all the steps carefully.


NOTE: I have also used a Dell Wireless Mouse and Windows 10 Home which seems to work fine with the mouse.


Step 1: Check to make sure the driver is working correctly. If it isn't, then you will need to add the driver manually.


Step 2: Find out if you are using the Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center service. Check to make sure that the service is not started (by pressing the Windows key and R and navigating to Control Panel > Services). If the service is running, then you may not need to do anything to enable it.


Step 3: If you are using the Windows Media Player service, go to Services\Windows Media Player > Service Status in Control Panel > Services to see if service is started or not. If it has not started, and it is still not started, then you may need to do a service restart. Start Menu > Run > Services.exe /stop > Restart.


Step 4: If you have selected Windows Media Center Service option in the previous step, you need to disable it to make sure all of your software correctly registers with Windows. You can search the web or do a search on your local computer for "disable Windows Media Player service" to find the proper procedure.


This is a general solution, but some people can get around the issue via a process of elimination. If you have a very bad internet connection or very slow modem, then you may not be able to get a full computer boot up. You may need to do a hard reset to get a full computer boot up.


Step 5: Go to Computer and Right Click on Start Menu > Select Control Panel > Select System.


Step 6: Click on Device Manager. Click on Advanced System Settings > click on Device Manager.


Step 7: Right Click on the name of the device you are experiencing trouble with and select Properties. Under the Device tab, under the Device name, click on Update Driver Software... > Browse my computer for driver software... > Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer.


Step 8: A new window will pop up, telling you that you need to install the latest device driver for this device. Click on Next. Windows Update will automatically download the latest device driver and install it for the device.


Step 9: Once the device driver installation is complete Windows Update will restart and complete installing any missing device driver updates.

In the first of a three-part series on Australia's Indigenous culture and people, The Weekly WTF, Greg Martin takes a look at the Aboriginal people who built Australia…

Before the arrival of Europeans, Australia was home to many tribes and cultures. They have been a part of Australia's culture since long before it was formed.

In the last ten years alone, a new generation of Aboriginal people have rekindled Aboriginal pride and passion for national unity and sovereignty. Their generation is challenging assumptions about Aboriginal heritage and who they are as a people.

Here are three young Aboriginal people from around Australia who are leading the charge today.

Kenny Kopera (aka "Ringo")

Kenny Kopera is a young Aboriginal man living in Queensland's Mackay region. This is his story.

His parents were from the Kimberley, an area that was the subject of fierce resistance to Australian colonization. Kopera's parents and his five siblings were uprooted and uprooted again, when his father and three siblings moved back to the Kimberley. Kopera's mother was unable to afford the journey home, so she remained in North Queensland and found work in the goldfields in Mackay.

With his Aboriginal identity under threat, Kopera made the courageous decision to study history. He discovered that the European experience began many years before European arrival. He then had a profound sense of loss knowing that while his forebears were the first Indigenous Australians, his own people who had struggled to survive here for countless generations, had already vanished.

He has spent much of his life in opposition to colonial injustice. While pursuing a degree in Indigenous arts and culture at University of Queensland he stood up to Queensland Government representatives and won over support for an Aboriginal-only education program. Then, at University in Sydney, he created a national forum for Indigenous artists, youth, writers and performers and launched a website to create safe spaces for Aboriginal Australians.

Last year while performing, he was the first Aboriginal performer to be nominated by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts in a lifetime achievement award.

This self-confessed young warrior is the only man to have stood up to Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Premier Gladys Berejiklian, protesting against the loss of traditional Australian ways and languages including:

Racism

Families, communities and language

Traditional medicine and spirituality

Language and culture

Racism Aboriginal Australia has lost over 40% of our languages. Only 1 million of the 3 million Indigenous languages still continue to be spoken. And that is just one example of Australia's profound loss.

"I don't want my culture lost to 'them'. I want my culture to exist in Australia," says Kenny Kopera.

Kopera and his young band have been involved in community-building projects; creating an Aboriginal-only beach at the University of Sydney to inspire and inspire young people. In 2016, they built an Aboriginal-only water feature at a beach in New South Wales. And, recently in April this year, they made headlines with their plans to build an Aboriginal-only memorial park in Sydney to commemorate the death of a local farmer, John Henry Bantu.

For Kopera the fight is long but he is on a mission. In an age where Indigenous people are disappearing at a horrific rate there are few people with his determination and desire to continue to fight. He has created a Facebook group called Aboriginal Land, Sea and People. It's an open, inclusive and non-hierarchical platform for sharing information and talking about Aboriginal issues.

Kenny says:

I'm trying to bring together people who don't necessarily speak the same languages or go in the same communities. The only reason I'm doing this is to bring all of our tribes together… We all want to live as equal citizens.

We asked Kenny for 10 words or terms that describe the Aboriginal culture.

"Indigenous Australians love their land. They really love the earth. They really love family. They're spiritual. They love their ancestors."

Aboriginal music is an important part of the Indigenous culture. A lot of it comes from a spiritual centre at Port Augusta in Western Australia. The music of The Grange of Kula continues on. An Aboriginal man named Rohan's music is as beautiful as it is powerful. When he plays his drum, it sends shivers through people's souls and tears tear-filled faces.

His band is based out of Port Arthur and their album "Red Earth" was a huge success on the festival circuit. He says:

We got to the festival circuit and played a lot more shows. In 2008 I got invited to play in Perth at the Red Hill music festival. I was on a plane at the airport and the people on the plane were all on their phones, checking things on their phones. I couldn't believe that most people

Spencer Platt/Getty Images President Donald Trump had harsh words for Democrats on Twitter Tuesday morning, blasting a "basket of idiots" and saying they didn't "want the US to be strong."

It was an unusually strong rebuke from Trump, who normally prefers to tiptoe around politics on social media and rarely goes after his political rivals, much less Democrats.

The president's tweet came just before 3 p.m., just minutes before FBI Director James Comey was scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his decision to write his blockbuster "discovery" letter to Congress less than two weeks before the election.

Trump followed up his tweet about Democrats with a warning: "If this story gets covered evenly, in 12 days I will have told you why I fired #FakeDossierGuy."

Trump had been angered earlier Tuesday by reports that his team was told in the spring that the Russians had information on his then-rival, Hillary Clinton, that could damage her candidacy. The dossier later turned up on a computer owned by former British spy Christopher Steele, who was retained in January 2016 by a Washington-based political research firm, Fusion GPS.

Trump had been told last summer that the Russians had amassed dirt on Clinton in a large-scalped dossier compiled by a former British intelligence officer - which was given by sources to FBI officials last spring - that contained specific allegations about the Democrat and her role in a uranium deal.

But Trump had been reluctant to acknowledge publicly, much less with a dossier, that Russia had dug up such material because doing so might have damaged his prospects for persuading a foreign government to curtail its meddling in the democratic process.

Trump and the Russia saga has been a recurring theme of much of Trump's first year in office, particularly in interviews and interviews with Fox News. In March, the president accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower and tweeted that Obama has "been smoking WAPO since January 20th."


Tuesday's tweets appeared to be Trump's latest attempt to focus attention on the Russia scandal, and on his own political standing. It came just after former Vice President Joe Biden told CNN that Trump's tweets about Comey, which have included a series of threats against the FBI director, may have an effect on his administration's effort to move the country to the left.

"The tweets may hurt his relationship with the FBI, and may in fact be damaging to our ability to work with the FBI," Biden said. "The president's tweets are obviously highly provocative. I also think some of them are highly inappropriate."

Trump appeared not to have followed Biden's remarks. Trump wrote on the same Twitter feed that he has "the absolute right to do what I feel is right," and "the media and the whole world will eventually come to terms with this. They will be thanking me once the successes begin to pour in!"<|endoftext|>The video will start in 8 Cancel

A former Tory MP who served in the House of Commons for 24 years was murdered because "members of the Establishment" were frightened of her plans to hold an inquiry into child sexual abuse, it's been reported.

Sarah Ferguson was stabbed and killed in the pub of the former Oxfordshire constituency home of her ex-boyfriend, Michael Adebolajo, on Friday.

The 33-year-old MP had been having a drink with her ex-boyfriend when the attack happened, and it is believed he broke down in tears.

Adebolajo - who is a member of the banned Islamist extremist group al-Muhajiroun - said he carried out the brutal killing as a "revenge" for the "war being fought on Muslims" by his ex-girlfriend.

Neighbours said Mr Adebolajo ran off after the attack, and that his ex-girlfriend and his daughter who was visiting at the time are "doing very well and being looked after".

Mr Adebolajo, a devout Muslim, has previously been convicted of criminal damage and served prison time for assaulting a man.

It is understood that Mr Ferguson had also held talks with her local MP Nick Boles, and the Commons has today launched an investigation into how she was killed, and will look into whether any measures could be taken to prevent the threat of future violence against her constituents.

A few weeks ago, the Internet went nuts over the "secret" new Samsung Galaxy Note5 that leaked online just weeks before the company would officially announce it. While the Note5 has been in various hands-on demonstrations, the company just released a new image and a teaser for the device, and we've got everything you need to know.

The device features a "5.9-inch QHD Super AMOLED display with a 2.5D curved edge-to-edge display" and a new dual-camera setup on the back. That dual camera setup is a pretty big deal—you may recognize it from earlier rumors—and Samsung hasn't said very much about it yet. The device's screen seems to have at least 1080p resolution across the entire 5.9-inch display, unlike previous Note handsets.

It's rumored the device can pack at least a 3,200mAh battery, which would be enough for both a day of use and a good amount of use in standby. A quad-core processor was also leaked, although neither Samsung or LG have confirmed that it will make its way into the Note5.

The devices come in five colors, with gold and blue versions of the device being the most likely at this point.

We also know the Note5 will have a microSD card slot and support "sensor cluster" technology that can allow for hands-free camera control, so you might have to plug it in to take photos without a phone. And Samsung's included a 3.55mm headphone jack which can easily be plugged in to headphones.

The Note5 will be officially announced on October 19 as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge are now on sale. No word just yet on the Note5's price, so check out the teaser below.

Nowadays, it's a powerful thing with all the powers of life and death and it is also quite useful. You could say that the Force is one of the most important beings in the universe. It helps keep people safe, and it allows people to do things they would never consider for themselves. In the galaxy, you will encounter powerful Force wielders, but they are the exceptions and not the rule. Some of the weaker Jedi never got much of a reputation. The Star Wars universe is filled with people who can manipulate the Force as well as they see fit. In the case of this post, we will try to find a unique Jedi we can call our personal personal heroes, and the first Jedi we will introduce is named Mace Windu..

I had never been a huge fan of Star Wars. There's something about it that just doesn't do it for me, because they have just that little "it" factor. That little bit of nostalgia, it just…stinks. Not only that, every time someone goes to see a movie or TV show about it, we hear about the Star Wars saga again, and I just always felt like they did it wrong. It feels like there was just a big hole there. I was always interested with the idea of the Force, but never gave it the time to grow on me. I finally started watching Star Wars because there was a prequel, Rebels, and I found myself really liking the Jedi. However, the first Force user I encountered was a lot more interesting to me.

When Darth Maul first appeared on screen he didn't look like much but he was just so freaking powerful. His power and technique just blew me away. He is a badass that you just have to see. For my part, I loved the Sith, that they are all powerful and evil, and even more so the dark side of the Force. It just appeals to my inner sadist. You know, everyone has a dark side, everyone hates, hates, hates everything, just…sad, dark, and all the rest. We all had to suffer from a dark side of the Force, a dark side of life that kept us away from happy times, so I always wondered why everyone hates the Sith so much.

I've always wanted to talk about someone that is a Sith for life, a Darth for life. I wanted to try to build that kind of relationship. So, I started playing around with the Jedi and came up with some interesting choices for my characters. But I was never really satisfied with my choice. That's why I decided to go looking for an example in the Star Wars universe and I found it on one of my favorite characters of all time. He's so much more awesome than I ever imagined.

Mace Windu is a member of the Jedi Order, but he's one of the lesser known ones in the Star Wars universe and this is why he was chosen as the first Jedi we will introduce in this post. Mace is much more experienced than you might think, he was trained by the legendary Qu

OTTAWA - The Liberals are defending their decision to renew funding for a federal organization that works with First Nations chiefs and councillors, saying the money will help the group's work find solutions to community problems.

The federal government provided $200 million last year to the Canadian Council on Aboriginal Peoples to work on a range of issues from housing to housing-related issues and child welfare.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised in the last election that his government would maintain funding for the council until 2023.

The Liberal platform outlined five priorities for housing for First Nations people, including making sure the government has the tools it needs to tackle housing conditions, including the number of units available, accessibility and affordability.

The federal government has yet to commit how much it will commit to improving the housing situation in Canada, but said it will be part of its economic action plan unveiled Monday.

The council says it's working on an analysis of housing costs and how to mitigate against them.

In a statement released Friday, spokesperson David McGuinty said the council expects to use the funding to hire additional staff to continue its advocacy work with more than 150 First Nations communities across the country.

And he said the council's work with First Nations may include reviewing the "unacceptably high cost of housing and the impact of the current housing affordability crisis on First Nations communities."

A report published on Monday by the council argues that First Nations may be more likely to "fail" to meet the needs of their local Aboriginal population that the federal government.

The report, titled Finding Better Housing for Aboriginal People and Communities, says that the existing Canadian housing affordability issue isn't unique to First Nations communities.<|endoftext|>In May last year, a judge told the jury that Michael Bryant was "one of the most dangerous, intelligent, cunning and cold-blooded child-killers in the British Isles." The judge said he was giving Bryant a sentence of life in prison with a minimum term of 10 years for a murder that he described as "cruel, evil and ruthless."

So did John Cundy know about the killer's mental state? Does he think a life sentence would have done anything except exacerbate Bryant's sense of loss and anger?

"I don't feel like my life has been wasted," Mr. Cundy said over the phone from a prison in the United States where he is in custody. "I think I've gotten it the worst deal possible." Cundy

Although it was announced today that Mr. Cundy is getting released on parole in 2015, his chances of ever settling in London again are uncertain.

John Cundy says that he still has his old life. His father still has his old life. He has even found a new work. He says he has a new job as a photographer, but it doesn't go quite as well as the photojournalism he did for the Daily Mail. The job is to send you pictures of the beautiful countryside, and, he told me, "to be a bit of a voyeur." So far he has made around $10,000, "but not as much as I was hoping for."

He was not sure if his wife knew he was working for the Daily Mail, but she said she would have suspected. He did not see any sign that she was upset.

"She's my girlfriend, but they don't know I'm a photographer. It's not a secret at all."

The next time we called, three weeks earlier, Cundy was at his father's house in London with his mother.

Cundy

She told me that her son hadn't changed at all since prison. He still smokes and drinks, she said. He still cries and has an extremely intense rage, but not in the same way. It has been replaced, she said, by an "intimate rage" because of the loss of her family.

"As long as he's alive he will go back to being a psychopath." Cundy

Cundy's mother said that the worst decision she ever made was giving him up early. Her husband had always been strict, and her father was dead for a few months when she married the son she later described to me as "not just the boy I thought he would be, but the man I didn't know I'd married." She said she had always known about his addiction, but "it was a different kind of addiction. It was not to cocaine; it was to killing."

Cundy said that when she was pregnant her son had a violent temper and he was a "disorderly child" who had to be put in the care of a special team for a while. She said she went into labor, went to the hospital and told the child specialist "something awful had happened, and I was certain it wasn't going to get any better."

The world's smallest nuclear reactor

By David Alexander

27 May 2017

The UK's SMR (Small Modular Reactor) project, also known as the Sorek reactor, is a project of the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in the UK, and it involves building one of the world's lowest-energy nuclear reactors, based on the design of the French EPR reactor. The cost of construction of the plant is estimated at about £900 million ($1.6 billion), including the cost of UK taxpayers' money for the project and the loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worth €1.2 billion ($1.65 billion).

The reactor will be located on the Northumberland coast around 12 miles south of the village of Sorek and at a depth of 20 meters. The first SMR prototype to be deployed is the EPR, which could potentially power about 6,600 homes, using 1,500 tons of spent fuel. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 9,633 kilowatts, which means that a single square meter of the reactor will convert the same power as 6,600 square meters of non-radioactive waste. The power density of the EPR is 857 kilowatts per cubic meter, while the SMR will be even more compact at 547 kilowatts per cubic meter.

"We are now in the initial safety and technical assessment stage. At that stage, we will conduct an operational demonstration with the operator that will include the use of key equipment," Simon Fairweather, Executive Project Manager for Small Modular Reactor, Inc., told the World Nuclear Association (WNA). "We are confident that the safety and reliability of the SMR, combined with its cost benefits, will be a major driver to secure funding for the Sorek project."

The initial demonstration will be conducted in 2018 and the plant is expected to be operational by 2023. Fairweather stated that the plant is in discussions with some nuclear utilities around the southern hemisphere (see Nuclear Energy in South America, below) in order to secure the financing.

The Sorek nuclear plant will be located at the foot of the Hebrides' rocky shore and will house four pressurized salt water reactors (PSRs). The reactors are built for a low-fuel load-followability with high power densities. At full power, the PSRs can operate for about 10 years, delivering 20 MW of power and generating about 50 tons of plutonium-239 each year. The production (about 10 tons in a year) of plutonium-239 from the reactors provides the nuclear fuel for all of Britain's nuclear reactors.

The plant will be a series of 12 reactors and is expected to cost £6 to £10 billion (US$9.6 to $13.8 billion). The price of the fuel for the first reactor is estimated at about $350/kg, which includes the electricity generated by the plant, about $400/kg for the fuel itself, $40/kg for the fabrication of the nuclear fuel, and the cost of the fuel rods themselves, and these costs are expected to come down through economies of scale, as the UK will have fewer of these plants. At full power, the cost of the fuel is expected to fall to $250/kg, with the electricity being reduced from about £15 to £11.

The cost for decommissioning would be £400 million ($630 million) for each unit, and the UK has already committed to decommissioning the Fermi plant and the Rokkasho plant in Japan. The first reactor in the UK is already slated for removal after 2036. Sorek is already part of the EPR consortium that operates the nuclear reactors in Japan.

"The potential for reducing the cost, time and risk of low-enriched uranium nuclear power, while providing power without greenhouse gases would be an enormous achievement for the UK, Europe and the rest of the world," said Michael Liebreich, Director of the Institute for Energy Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. On the basis of the recent decommissioning of the Sorek plant, he said, decommissioning of the plants in France and Sweden could be expected to cost €40 billion ($55 billion) and €60 billion ($75 billion). "A SMR could achieve similar economies of scale," according to Liebreich. In addition to using "cleaner" fuel, a plant based on a modular design could also reduce the waste of fuel from the fuel rods themselves.

The SMR has strong supporters in the US and Germany as well as the European Union, which has a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as energy dependence on fossil fuels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that nuclear power will remain the world's major electricity generator in 2040. The EIA says that a nuclear power plant in the UK

After an eight-month investigation, Texas A&M has agreed to pay $25 million to settle discrimination allegations against football coach Kevin Sumlin, the university announced Wednesday.

The settlement deal is the only one of its kind and is the largest in SEC history, university officials say.

"The university recognizes there are no perfect resolutions to this matter," said A&M athletic director Bill Byrne. "However, the university has concluded that by the terms of the settlement agreement and the seriousness of the claims, this is the best resolution."

The Aggies declined to comment on the settlement, but in a statement, Sumlin said: "I'm glad this is over. This is nothing a student could ever understand. I have loved working at A&M and can never thank my family, the University of Texas and all the great Aggie fans enough for everything. This university has been such an important part of my life to get to this point. I want to thank the school and my teammates, coaches, staff and friends for an unbelievable football journey. I look forward to the next challenge."

The lawsuit, filed in May in U.S. District Court in San Antonio, alleged that a black male student received the minimum scholarship and that a white female student was not promoted to a position she was more qualified for despite better performance. That student also complained discrimination in receiving tickets to Aggies home games.

Two white women also had to transfer to a school that was much closer to A&M, according to the suit. A third female student also complained of being passed over for a position she applied for even though she was a less-qualified candidate.

The settlement, which will be reviewed by an appointed Special Master, addresses all claims but not one that is specifically linked to Sumlin, according to a statement from A&M.

"This is an unfortunate and regrettable chapter in University of Texas Athletics history," Byrne said.

The settlement will be paid directly out of the Aggies' budget and is expected to take effect in 90 days.

The university and university officials "remain focused on educating the Aggie student-athletes and their families about the benefits of an education and career at Texas A&M" and on improving "coaching and recruiting processes," the university said in a written statement.

Sumlin, who has been Aggies' head coach since January 2011, is the school's 18th head coach and fifth defensive coordinator. The university has announced 10 other coaches will not return for their third or fourth seasons.

"Our hope is this will not represent a change in the overall culture of A&M and I know as coach Sumlin makes this transition into his new career that's the direction it won't be," athletic director DeLoss Dodds said in a statement.

The university also said the University Act is still in law, a reference to the Texas Education Code. But in a statement to cleveland.com, Byrne said Sumlin, who has five years remaining on his contract, is no longer employed by the school and "he remains an Aggie and is actively involved in the Aggie family's programs."

Texas A&M's interim director for human resources Steve Patterson, said this week the university has started internal reviews of how it handles allegations of discrimination.

"The university must understand that its actions must be viewed in the context of larger institutional issues and systemic racism in our country," he said.

Byrne added: "We acknowledge the work of the Special Master and believe we have made positive progress to this point. We are taking a different approach with next year's program. That is something we and our students will continue to work to improve over the next period of time."

The suit claims the Aggies didn't take proactive measures to reduce racial diversity on their staffs, such as hiring more minority coaches or promoting female football staff members to their current roles.

According to the university, about 8 percent of the university's coaches between 2001 — the year Sumlin was hired and the year the suit was filed — and 2014 were minority or women. They also noted that the Aggies have increased minority football coaches and promoted other minorities to full-time positions.

Texas A&M did not offer specifics about it hiring of minorities on staffs.

But the university did note that the Aggies hired a black woman coaching position on the defensive line a year ago after hiring seven male defensive line coaches, including former coach and defensive line coach Tosh Lupoi's son, in 2013. A&M also promoted women's assistant defensive backs coach Tracy Rocker in 2014.

Sumlin, Byrne said, is "the right person to rebuild the Aggie Football program" and that he understands he did not hire all Aggies students and that there is "a lot of work ahead of us to better our football program."

"We will continue to do our part to create more opportunities for our

Chinese students are the biggest spenders in education in the world, according to the UN University Education Report.

The report, published annually on Tuesday, shows the US, France and the UK are most well endowed, while China, with its huge pool of students, accounts for the world's biggest spending on education.

The report also ranks university performance around the world, with the UK in 15th place - but only the second country after South Korea in terms of student numbers.

But China's universities are struggling.

The report, sponsored by UN schools and universities, is based on a survey of academics and experts from the world's leading higher education institutions. It covers more than 1,200 institutions.

The top 10 highest-spending countries

China (4.6% of average international student expenditure) - £6,924 US (£3,928) - £4,947 France (4.6% of average international student expenditure) - £4,851 Germany (5.4% of average international student expenditure) - £4,711 UK (4.6% of average international student expenditure) - £4,695 Australia (4.8% of average international student expenditure) - £4,625 Canada (4.6% of average international student expenditure) - £4,523 Singapore (4.8% of average international student expenditure) - £4,515

In 2010-11 about 30% of the £25bn of students going to university in China came from abroad. Many of these enrolments are from China's 1.35 billion nationals.

Of the top students, many are students who have been encouraged by educational authorities to study abroad, the UK report says.

The report says that China also has the largest number of underrepresented nationalities, which can take years to find places in university.

The most likely countries to be underrepresented are:

Ethiopians or Ethiopians - 38% have never heard of the UK.

Burma or Myanmar – 30% have never heard of Australia.

Kenyans, South Africans and Somalis – 26% have barely heard of Canada.

Africans - 25% have never heard of Australia.

Asians, Malaysians, Indonesians, Malaysians and Chinese are some of the most well-represented groups.

The best-funded countries in the world

US (£4,250 per year)

France (£3,942)

Germany (£3,890)

UK (£3,890)

India (£3,700)

South Korea (£3,600)

Brazil (£2,750)

Australia (£2,600)

South Africa (£2,450)

Canada (£2,400)

Brazil (£2,350)

India (£2,400)

South Korea (£2,360)

In Europe, the UK is tops in the region for students, with the UK university sector spending more than any other country in the world.

It is followed by France - which is third in the region - and then Germany.

France's students spend about three-quarters of what London students spend - and about one-third of what Indian students spend.

Image caption British students spend over 1,000% more on university fees in comparison with Chinese students - although there are huge differences on earnings

The top UK universities, including Imperial College London, Cambridge and Oxford, are funded by a range of sources including the government.

At the top of the league table, the report says, is the UK's Russell Group, which includes the universities of Cambridge and Oxford in Cambridge, and Imperial College London in London.

Some universities in the UK have been able to offer a large number of low-cost fee-paying students - so that the students are not subsidised by the state.

Some universities in countries which are not traditionally regarded as highly-educated, such as India and Pakistan, also make the top eight for highest students expenditure.

What do the rankings show?

The UN University Education Report is based on surveys of the world's leading universities asking experts about various aspects of their programmes and facilities.

Students and academics in the survey are judged on the quality of programs, how well the teaching staff can communicate and help students in their studies, and on how accessible their facilities are for students.

The report uses eight indicators: teaching costs; the quality of lecturers; how easy it is for students to do research; the number of research projects available in the institution; the value of degree-awarding events; the number of international students available; the number of degrees awarded; and the quality of facilities offered by the institution.

In addition the UN report looks at the
======================================== SAMPLE 147 ========================================
On a recent afternoon at a diner near the Los Angeles airport, I asked someone what they thought of the idea that a lot of the world's water could soon be pumped into the ground to raise sea levels. The answer: not very much at all. The person said that in order to put nearly half the total freshwater on earth under the sea, there would have to be a drastic decrease in the amount of rain that falls on the surface each year.

But this is unlikely to happen.

Rain falling in California gets about 10% to 15% of its flow from subterranean sources each year, making it more than 50% renewable water, according to Peter Gleick, who runs the Pacific Institute's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, which maintains a database of global freshwater reserves.

The main issue, I said, is that for the oceans to be pumped full of freshwater, the ocean waters are going to have to be salty and acidic, which is bad news for some fish, plants, and birds.

When the oceans turn salty over a long time period, that affects everything from marine life to animals that rely on currents and other ways to move around.

"That's why the Earth's oceans have so little fresh water," Gleick said, "because you're not going to get it all at once."

Still, we're going to have to solve two significant problems within five to 10 years on this scale. So let's explore each.

• Is water too salty for humans to drink?


One big challenge we may face early on is figuring out how to get rid of salt, or at least significantly dilute it.

According to one assessment, if the amount of water pumped into the oceans to raise sea level dropped by just 7cm in 20 years, it would take 6,000 years for the sea to rise another 10cm.

If we want 10cm of sea level rise in a generation, that would mean about 5,000 cubic kilometres of freshwater would have to be stored annually.

The world's existing large-scale storage facility for freshwater, Lake Mead, provides almost 10% of available freshwater.

But at an estimated $1 per cubic metre, it would take at least $500bn (£314bn) of new storage to meet the challenge, Gleick said.

• How will the world's food system react when there's less freshwater?


According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), some 2 billion people now depend on fish for about 60% of their dietary intake, mostly wild-caught tuna and other fish.

But, Gleick said, at current rates of consumption growth, that figure is going to have to be halved in the next 25 years.

And that is problematic.

In the dry areas of the Pacific Ocean, fish farmers could see their fish become less abundant, he said.

In the humid areas, the demand on the area's fish farms would rise, leading to further declines in biodiversity and even greater depletion of aquaculture fisheries.

What all this really means, Gleick said, is that food systems around the world depend on a lot more freshwater than today. And we may run out of it early.

In the United States, the US Department of Agriculture is working on a project to develop a new model of a viable aquaculture industry that will be based on freshwater and fish.

But Gleick said there is a risk that if we don't get this right, aquaculture will simply become an even less efficient food source, leading to further cuts in fish and fish products.<|endoftext|>A man who allegedly threatened to kill Muslim girls in an anti-Muslim video has been given an eight-day sentence.

Mohammed Iqbal Hussain, who is from Pakistan, appeared at Leeds Crown Court in West Yorkshire charged with two offences of using threatening words or behaviour. Mr Justice Lloyd Jones told the court the comments were "highly derogatory" towards Islam. Mr Hussain admitted making the video on January 30 - and appeared unshaven and wearing a tracksuit bottoms. The prosecutor said it was uploaded on Facebook and described it as anti-Muslim. In the video, he said he went to a mosque and watched some men there who "knew what was coming". He went on: "We will see the day when Muslims will know how to put on their shoes and their socks and how to take off their shoes. These men know the whole plan. You will see the day." There was no immediate reaction from the Muslim community. Mr Hussain then appeared to accuse Britain of "thousands of years" of "cultural imperialism" and "unilateral and double standards", when in reality he has the Muslim world's backing.

Judge Lloyd Jones sentenced the 33-year-old to a minimum eight-day jail term, on top of two years' good behaviour as he imposed sentence.

After a series of delays and an even more lengthy overhaul, the U.K. home secretary is inching closer to an appointment to replace Justice Michael Kirby. While some reports suggest that she's ready to recommend that he step down, that will be the last word on this particular mystery. The UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, does not have the power to name an individual to the U.K. Supreme Court by herself. When Parliament debates replacing Kirby with someone else, or if he quits, it will need to pass a formal motion of confidence.

That process will take at least a year, if not longer, after Parliament returns from its summer recess. But if the motion of confidence moves through both Houses of Parliament in its entirety, Rudd and her cabinet can push the final button, naming Justice David Prosser as her replacement.

The last few months have seen much speculation about the future of Justice Kirby. Although he was appointed by the U.K. government to sit on the U.K. Supreme Court, Kirby does not hold such a post himself. Instead, he serves as the U.K.'s representative on the International Court of Justice, a specialized international tribunal that resolves legal disputes between states. His appointment was widely seen as a means of signaling that the UK wanted to take a more active role in addressing disputes between it and individual states. Prosser holds similar views, saying that the U.K. "believes that the ICC is an important partner for the U.K. to build a safer world," adding that he hopes to "lead the U.K.'s work with ICC on a regular basis."

However, in recent weeks, there have been reports that Prosser is feeling besieged. An anonymous source told The Sunday Times that there is a "dramatic split" with the government over the direction of the court, which is headed by Prosser instead of the head of the judiciary, which is currently Sir Declan Morgan.

In his article, The Unfinished Case Against Justice Prosser, former U.K. solicitor general Dominic Grieve described Prosser's relationship with the government "in crisis" and said that he had lost confidence in the leader of his team, Richard Thomas QC. A former justice minister, Grieve wrote that Prosser was "too easily distracted" and suffered from a "deluded sense that the case is close to being concluded" that left him "willing to consider a resignation as a consequence of his own mistakes."

Justice Prosser would find out just how far his relationship with the U.K. government had fallen if he took up his new position in April. But given how difficult it is to find a new court chief, the likelihood is that he will stay on. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that he would step down without something substantial to replace him on the Supreme Court with. Prosser could be appointed to the British Bar, which is already facing serious staff reductions. Justice Michael Kirby is set to retire on the end of this year.

Nevertheless, the fate of Justice Prosser is not entirely in the hands of his replacement. If Parliament approves Prosser's appointment, it will require his signature. However, this is much easier said than done.

Prosser's supporters believe this would be the only way for the Court to proceed in the aftermath of Justice Kirby's departure. A member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Scott Nelson, told BBC News:

This appointment is an acknowledgement that, in order to replace Justice John Sirica as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, there is no one more qualified than David Prosser to do so. Justice Gavin Hutchinson has no prior judicial experience, and this appointment will ensure that a new Chief Judge of the Supreme Court has a strong and experienced case making background."

Justice Nigel Peters, a former member of parliament for the Conservatives, is another supporter of Prosser's appointment. Peters argued in a letter to Parliament earlier this month that he would be "extremely reluctant to sanction any judicial reshuffle that would allow another justice to replace John Sirica." Even if the U.K. government agreed to allow Prosser to become chief justice, there would be a battle to make sure it gets one. Although Prosser has had a long career as a judge, he was in the news last week when he was removed from a case against a hotel chain that allegedly discriminated against a gay couple. "I have no doubt that a case of this nature will provoke a fierce backlash from various quarters," a U.K. solicitor said afterwards.

One of Prosser's opponents, however, is Nigel Adams, a Tory MP. He wrote to The Daily Mail last week noting that Prosser "has been the focus of controversy" for several years, which is "why he should not be allowed to take the reins of the Supreme Court."

It is unclear how long a fight Prosser would take

A former staffer in Donald Trump's presidential campaign was accused of sexual harassment earlier this month by a former female volunteer.

The woman, Jessica Leeds, told the New York Times on Wednesday that her alleged assailant tried to have sex with her multiple times when she volunteered for Trump's campaign during the time Trump was running for president.

Leeds said that during the campaign, she was asked to meet Trump at the Ritz-Carlton in New York City. While arriving, she claims that someone in the hotel room invited her for a tour.

Leeds claimed that, while inside the hotel room, Trump began kissing her and that he forced his tongue down her throat. She claimed that the incident took place in the early 1990s and that Trump also kissed three other women in the room.

Leeds stated in the Times that she decided to go public with her allegation after receiving a series of threatening calls from Trump's campaign.

Trump released a statement to the Times in response to the story.

"This whole thing was fabricated," said Trump, addressing Leeds. "Take a look at her, and you tell me what you think. I don't think so."<|endoftext|>Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un are scheduled to meet in Pyongyang, North Korea at an unspecified date, according to a report by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Q: I'm a new member, why should I have it checked?

A: Due to the high incidence of false positive tests for thyroid disease, in recent years, many medical professionals have suggested that physicians check for nodules on thyroid ultrasound examinations. This makes sense because, on the basis of your age, sex and general health, it is quite likely that you may be carrying at least one thyroid nodule. Some physicians even recommend screening as long as they are certain that you are not carrying other health problems such as cancer or bleeding disorders.


Unfortunately, some physicians tend not to follow proper screening recommendations. In some cases, they fail to realize that you could be carrying a thyroid nodule, even though it is visible on an ultrasound examination.


Furthermore, some physicians have even prescribed unnecessary thyroid drugs in some cases as the "safe and effective" means of treating thyroid diseases. You are very unlikely to be treated in order to cure a disease, simply because of the symptoms you experience at the same time. In some states, some physicians have even made false claims regarding the benefits of thyroid drugs. These practices have led to a number of lawsuits, resulting in many patients taking their thyroid medication without proper medical guidance.


Q: Can I be prescribed thyroid replacement medication without a screening and evaluation?

A: Yes, but that's not recommended or required by the American College of Radiology (ACR) or the American Thyroid Association (ATA).


Some people believe that thyroid replacement medications can provide additional health benefits. However, there is very little or no scientific evidence supporting any of the currently available thyroid replacement medication methods. If you are wondering whether you should be using thyroid replacement medication, the answer is that you should do all tests necessary, including screening, to make sure that your thyroid condition is not causing symptoms that require treatment. However, if your condition is causing symptoms that clearly warrant a thyroid evaluation, it would not be prudent to ignore these symptoms.

Q: What other tests should I be doing?

A: You should have your thyroid glands evaluated by a doctor or endocrinologist. You should have your thyroid glands sampled to see if there is a problem with how they work. Your thyroid gland should have been evaluated by a thyroid specialist at least once within the last three to five years. You might also have your thyroid evaluated by ultrasound, endocrine laboratory testing or an endocrine-related clinical exam. Your doctor should be able to tell whether you are having symptoms related to thyroid disease that warrant treatment with medications. Your endocrine treatment regimen should be carefully evaluated before giving you anything that has the potential to harm you (such as birth

Django and Django Girls

Why Django and not Rails or JavaScript?

Dedjango is written in Python. If you write something in Python you can expect something similar in Python. What's more, the people behind Django and Django Girls have a lot of experience with developing web applications with Python.

Django is more widely used because it's easy to use and easier to get started with and learn. If something doesn't work or you need some documentation on D, it's a piece of cake. If you want to learn Django you can just read documentation, look at the API docs or get help on the #django IRC channel.

Django and Django Girls provide a great place to learn more about web app development with Django. With the help of Django Girls you'll have a solid grasp of the main principles of building applications with Django.

What is Django?

Django is the open source web framework by which hundreds of thousands of projects are built every day. While Django is used by both developers and non-developers, Django Girls aims to help non-devs become more comfortable with Django.

Why Django?

Django was designed out of necessity. The Python platform was designed to be a powerful, high-level programming language. Its strong type system helps prevent programmer errors and lets you build applications easily. Django was created to fit this strong and versatile language in the best possible way.

Since the early days of the web development industry, web servers have been slow and bloated compared to Python's standard library. Django fills that void by providing tools for working with databases securely. Django also makes the development of web applications easier by taking care of all the tedious detail.

Why do I need Django?

Django lets you use a more object-oriented style of programming, instead of using more procedural constructs. It's possible to build applications easily in Django, which is important if you're building web applications.

Django and Django Girls

Django and Django Girls will provide you with a solid grounding in Python and Django. The aim is to teach you the fundamentals of web application building to help you get started with Django as quickly as possible.

Each Django and Django Girls course will contain lessons on different aspects of web development. Each Django or Django Girls course will include:<|endoftext|>A Texas police officer claims that he was wrongly fired from his job as a "Biblical" cop.

Officer Ryan Scott, who served with the Houston police department for almost a decade, believes, according to an internal lawsuit, he was treated unfairly and forced to "reinvent" his career after he refused to convert to Christianism during his Christian orientation.

SPONSORED

Scott was terminated from the police in October, after he refused to agree to become a Christian during his orientation. According to the lawsuit which was filed by a Houston public relations firm, there was a "lack of concern for the plaintiff based upon his failure to commit to the position of officer without having accepted the Defendant's position of officer."

Scott argued that being a Christian at work "is incompatible with the duties and responsibilities of a police officer." According to the internal lawsuit, the supervisor of the department had asked Scott to pray before the orientation as a way to ease his fears about a terrorist attack. Scott refused to "reinvent [his] career because [he] did not have the confidence to return to work."

The manager of the Houston Police Department, Gary Mielke, said that Scott was sacked because there was no basis to hold onto the officer.

"The Houston Police Department has many people of varying beliefs and backgrounds and, as a matter of policy that does not happen," Mielke stated in a statement. "It is not up to us to dictate to a suspect — even a Muslim suspect — what kind of prayers or Bible studies they may or may not conduct with their employees."

A Houston jury is now deliberating the case.

======================================== SAMPLE 151 ========================================
A new study conducted by the University of South Carolina Health Care School of Pharmacy provides more evidence that taking aspirin can lower the risk of heart-attack and stroke.

Previous studies have suggested that regular aspirin use in adults is linked with less risk of heart disease. The new study, in the November 2014 Journal of the American College of Cardiology, says that the effect is based on a study limited to just one group, men.

Researchers analyzed data from the Pritikin Trial, a randomized, open-label investigation of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and its potential cardiovascular effects among more than 100,000 men who took aspirin when they were 38-years old or older. Those taking aspirin were more likely to have lower strokes and heart attacks and more likely to have died from cardiovascular disease, the most common cause of death.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, and the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and was conducted by the National Center for Research Resources.

Sung-Whan Lee, Ph.D., an assistant professor of pharmacology at the University of South Carolina, says, "We found that women in particular had an increased risk with taking aspirin when they were 38" because researchers used a population-based study that was designed specifically for women. This study is important because it provides the strongest evidence to date of how aspirin may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and women were included in the study because aspirin use is significantly higher in women than men.

The team of researchers analyzed blood levels in the men, called baseline endothelial function, for more than 3.5 million participants. They found that for each unit increase in baseline endothelial function, the risk of heart attack decreases by 17 percent and stroke decreased by 37 percent during follow-up, with no significant differences between men and women.<|endoftext|>As part of the "Bucket List" promotion for the upcoming Disney animated classic Big Hero 6, fans can enjoy the original animated short "Wings" on demand through their Roku streaming player and smartphones.

Ulfric (Ornamental) Race Imperial Gender Male Died 11E 201

Ulfric Stormcloak was the leader of the Stormcloak rebellion of High Rock in the early years of the Third Era.

After an alliance with the Thalmor was betrayed and the Empire was weakened by their actions in Hammerfell during the Stormcloak Rebellion of 3E 399, Ulfric led the Stormcloaks as a military force in the war against the Empire. Following the Empire's defeat at Fort Frostmoth, Ulfric led his Stormcloak army as it marched on Orsinium, then part of the Empire. In order to distract Imperial forces in the area, the Stormcloaks assaulted the Imperial Legion and, under the leadership of Galmar Stone-Fist, assassinated the Emperor Titus Mede II. Ulfric was then assassinated by his own lieutenant, Alikr the Soulflayer. The Empire immediately annexed High Rock and all the surrounding Imperial provinces. This, along with the Imperial Legion occupying the Imperial City, resulted in the Empire taking complete control of most of the Province, including Falkreath, which was left with

There were many great stories told during the annual New Orleans Mardi Gras, but one event in particular captured the imagination of millions around the world. I'm talking about the parade—a celebration of street life—in New Orleans.

There are so many wonderful ways to commemorate Mardi Gras, and on Mardi Gras Day, the streets of New Orleans are filled with fun events, including parades, festivals and parties. New Orleans is a city of neighborhoods—all of us are in some way home for at least four seasons and that includes New Orleans Mardi Gras.

The best parades happen Saturday evening, with the city turning into a sea of red and green, as the streets of New Orleans take center stage. There's no better way to celebrate this special day than to parade as a group or with friends.

New Orleans Mardi Gras Parade

If you can't make it down to New Orleans this Mardi Gras, why not make it to one of the many parades held across the Greater New Orleans region? You can march by yourself for a good cause, or make some new friends or make that perfect impression. Check out the list of participating parades to find one near you.

For a parade that's fun for all ages, check out the 10-Mile New Orleans Mardi Gras Run. The race offers entertainment for the whole family with over 70 races around the New Orleans area.

The best ways to celebrate Mardi Gras in New Orleans are on or around Mardi Gras Eve. It's also a good opportunity to make new New Orleanians. Check out the following events, with some participating at any time of the year.

1. New Orleans Mardi Gras Masquerade Party

The parades and parties are great, but there is something even better than having fun with family and friends. Every year, the Crescent City Mardi Gras Parade celebrates its fifth year—one of the longest continually running parades in the United States. The parade draws millions of fans to New Orleans each year, and people from all over the world come to see the parade. This year, Mardi Gras Eve will celebrate the parade's fifth anniversary with a celebration featuring music by The Brass Parade, live performances by Mardi Gras Mavens, carnival rides, a bonfire, fireworks and a grand finale where you can watch a parade of floats down the NOPAC, the Big Easy Aquarium and the Riverwalk. The party starts at 9 p.m. with DJ Pauline B., and runs down to midnight. Admission is free.

2. Mardi Gras in the Garden

If you get a chance to watch the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, be sure to attend the New Orleans Mardi Gras Ball at the Uptown Theater Saturday night. This year's festival celebrates the 30th anniversary of the musical, Mardi Gras: A Louisiana Mardi Gras. Guests will be treated to a concert by the New Orleans jazz legends, including Tony Bennett and the Benny Davis Orchestra, as well as a fireworks show that will dazzle the skies over Uptown. Tickets are $50 and can be purchased at the Uptown Theatre box office.

3. Mardi Gras Fireworks

I'm sure you already have some ideas about what to do, but I'm about to get a whole new wave of ideas. I'm told Saturday night, watch fireworks along the Mississippi River from the Grand Avenue Bridge. This is not one of your typical New Orleans New Year's Eve fireworks shows. But if you are in a group of three or more, it's sure to be unforgettable. Get a good night's sleep before the event and your feet will be ready for a hot New Year's day.

4. New Orleans Street Fest

There are countless parades in the city, but there are only a few celebrating New Orleans street life. The New Orleans Street Festival and the Louisiana Street Festival are two of these parade-inspired event. The events will provide you with everything from live entertainment, to rides and food.

6. Mardi Gras for the Whole Family

Another way to celebrate Mardi Gras is to celebrate the New Orleanians that live and work in the city. It might seem a little strange, but it's great to get to know all the new people you meet on Mardi Gras. There's so much to do, and you'll be happy you did.

You don't have to live in New Orleans to participate and there are so many great ways to participate in the parade. Look at the list below to see some events throughout the city.

If you find a great Mardi Gras event or a fun story to share, be sure to be honest with us in the comment box below.

There's a new batch of ads for the Apple Watch released today to much mirth and concern from Apple fans, with a number of them taking aim at the Apple Watch's new Sport mode, which combines the traditional sport-focused watch face with some nice new functionality.The most common complaint on the web was that this is not a sport watch face, and many assumed that the Sport watch faces we're used to seeing would only be available via the $349 Sport bundle. However, Apple is clearly making this a stand-alone new category, and the "Sport" sport straps that have been available for about a year are not the way to go.The new watch faces look almost exactly like older sport watch faces, at first glance. Instead of a sport face displaying a map, the new faces display the route for a new workout. They include a number of features for running and cycling enthusiasts that would be difficult to find or create on a standard sport watch face.Here's an example of a "New Trainer" watch face that is much more in line with what I expected a sport watch to look like without any extra effort. There are a few more examples available to view below.A new "Stride" and "Climb to Go" watch face is also showing up in the apps section of the Mac App Store today, but it's far from clear that they're being labeled as Sport or not.Apple is clearly giving it a shot at creating a unique category of watch faces for those of you who want to use some of the unique functionalities that the technology makes possible.While the company has used the WatchKit APIs to create some pretty cool watch faces for iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV, much like how it's doing to create smartwatch apps for other platforms, it's also giving users a lot of flexibility to design their own faces. There's a free iPhone app in the App Store that lets you draw your own unique watch face -- the only difference is that this can be based on some photos or illustrations, or just text.With the new iPhone 7 and the upcoming Apple Watch Series 4 hardware, Apple appears to be finally bringing those Watch faces to its hardware. The lack of a stand alone new sports watch face for the Apple Watch has long been a criticism of the technology, and has been rumored to be the reason for the introduction of the "Apple Watch Edition" at WWDC 2015 earlier this week.Apple has already given some users the ability to customize the Sport watch face based on what their wrist position looks like on a daily basis, and we can expect to see more like this coming to the Apple Watch soon.With the new Sport watch faces that are now available, users are also allowed to select from pre-configured options, like time zones, day of the week, time period, weather, and an Apple Watch Edition style. All of the new watch faces include their own weather icons, which is nice and unique, not being associated with a traditional sport watch face with only two or three icons like we've seen before.It's pretty obvious that Apple Watch Series 4 hardware will be able to support the new watch faces coming in this update, as Apple has said these faces will be pre-loaded on Apple Watch Series 4. The only thing that needs to happen on the iPhone side is the iPhone needs to be paired with the watch in order to use any of the new faces.<|endoftext|>I am in a position to comment on one of the issues raised tonight by Mr Deputy Speaker: the appointment (by Mr Speaker) as Chairman and Chairperson of the Committee on the Constitution:


"The Committee on the Constitution


Estimated cost: £30 000"


I am not alone in seeing that this committee would be a waste of money, and could not be made to be worth the cost of its establishment.


I am a firm opponent of the constitutional Convention, and consider that only the General Assembly should draft the new amendments.

However, if the Assembly is to retain control of the constitution, it should make the final selection of its three most acceptable proposals for the next constitution, as it is the only way to provide for accountability to the people.


When I was first elected as an Anti Con coner in 2001, I was concerned to see the number of Anti Con coners in the local areas and elsewhere in the country on increasing. Many of these people did not believe that the Government should be able to amend the constitution.

These people were not, generally speaking, anti Con coners, although they would not disagree more than most on the role of the Constitution in England. They felt it should be left in the hands of a local government, and that local government was best placed to reflect the different needs of the different areas.

On my election I was not prepared to rule out the creation of a new committee, or of the creation of three new committees to examine various amendments.

I wanted them to be as inclusive as possible and therefore to use the Local authority chairmanship as a

A lot of you are asking me how you should create your own website, how to create your own theme, how to use Squarespace or your other site building tools.

The fact is, there is one website building solution that works really well for almost every problem we encounter and it's WordPress.

The truth is, WordPress is the most popular (that's according to Google) content management system, at almost twice as popular as any of the other options.

But the truth is, there exists a number of free or low-cost websites that have been built around WordPress.

WordPress theme is a simple text file (with a .js file in it if you are on a Joomla or Drupal site), a bunch of code that, while readable and valid, is not much of a template for a WordPress site.

All you need to do is drag the .html file and save this file as your theme. In WordPress, create a directory to store all of your themes and put your chosen theme in it.

All of your files go inside here. You're ready to go!

Themes are one of the most unique and useful features you get when using WordPress. If you ever wanted to create a theme on your computer but found you preferred to use a graphic designer or an expert to do it for you, you can also do it with WordPress or any other hosting service.

AMY GOODMAN: We end today's show with the story of an 8-year-old boy who spent the day with former President Barack Obama in Chicago on Saturday. In his letter to Obama this week, Kaya, the boy said he was inspired by President Obama's story during childhood.

KAYA: Now when my mom started making popcorn, she put the kernels in another bag and filled it with water so I wouldn't go crazy! When you see my story now it doesn't make any sense that I'm doing it for a man I don't even know. People tell me all the time, "If you can do something good, do it." So I'm trying really hard because I don't want anyone to tell me no.

AMY GOODMAN: Kaya Wilson, a student at the U.S. Air Force Academy, is the youngest person to have traveled with the former president to an elementary school in Chicago. Wilson said he first met President Obama in 2001 when she visited him in the White House. He sat next to her, took her photograph and said, "I love your mom."

In this clip, Kaya's letter to President Obama, in which he describes himself as "a little kid who likes to play with pens and make things," before explaining why he and his fellow students spent the day with him. President Obama read the letter Friday during his first trip to Chicago since his election as president. This is in footage that aired on NBC Nightly News on Monday.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is my eighth time in Chicago. And I love every time I come, not just because of the love it brings me—love of Chicago, love of the people, love of the diversity, love of everything I've learned—but this is also about my family. So for my mother and father, it's been really beautiful for them to be able to see me here and then take us on a tour of the city—not just in the last few weeks, but over the last many, many years—and see where I've been, see where my friends who are here today are.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Donald Trump speaking Friday evening at his Chicago rally, hours before he delivered a speech defending his own family's history of racism, including the birther crusade. He also mentioned his mother.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This was my mother's hometown.

AMY GOODMAN: Kaya Wilson, the story of Barack Obama and his 9-year-old daughter, Malia, whose name he changed to Sasha in honor of his late mother, the president's half-sister, was recently profiled in The New Yorker magazine.

For more, we're going to Chicago, to Chicago Public Schools trustee candidate André Bracy, a graduate of the University of Chicago, currently running for the office of Chicago Public Schools Trustee on the Democratic Party line. He's talking about this extraordinary story, and this incredible 8-year-old boy, Kaya Wilson, who got to visit the commander in chief.

And, André Bracy, as you know, you are an incredible, inspiring candidate for president of Chicago Public Schools. Why did you run?

Losing his job after he made a rape joke at a conference, a Pennsylvania man found a new lease on life by playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons.

"I want to be the player that walks off stage, gets fired and then starts doing dungeons and dragons again," said the 30-year-old, whom The Huffington Post is not naming for his safety. "There are no consequences."

Despite his best efforts, the "victim" decided not to play.

"You need to understand that this is still the man who made the rape joke and is terrified to face him," he said.

This story originated with a tweet out of Philly.com.

@M_K_Zing @PhillyMike_Dennis Yes the victim will be able to get into the game, but would be scared of the player. — Joe DePaolo (@joe_devolo) August 5, 2016

It has taken the media around the world about 12-hours to realize the gravity of the situation. The victim has yet to file charges.

When you get this many people saying that #Gamergate is over I know we've hit a tipping point.

https://t.co/Ki3nLpPjv3 — Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) August 5, 2016

D&D has been a part of most of the D&D games I've play in my adulthood. It's part of my gaming heritage. This isn't a new game and the guy I met played the same game as the guy who was trying to rape me.

What you call this behavior is the same thing you call rape. When you play a game.

When you play a game.

If I knew then what I know now. I would never play a game with someone like that. I wouldn't want to hang out.

A woman in her 30s playing D&D is a sign of what's happening today.

Gaming is not an escape; it's a necessity. You can't have an identity without playing games. D&D is important. Not for everyone. Many adults don't want to play the game. But it doesn't hurt to play.

This is an important issue and I hope more people will read this and feel empowered to speak out. But even if it turns out they do get fired, no one should pay, or suffer, or be afraid.

You can't have an identity without doing this.

I'm not saying gamers are bad. There are many good men and women playing games. (I'm not going to name names, because I want people to know what these guys are like!) A guy on Twitter recently told me it's ok to call you a girl. Don't get mad! But even still, he should know that "I can't tell if he thinks it's ok, because of their shared identity as someone who has a certain identity of theirs, or because they actually have an actual problem with people who call them that" because "It's impossible to tell sometimes, it's not like you can just say 'hey I'm a dude who doesn't like guys who are fat'."

There's nothing wrong with being a nerd. I want more female and female-identifying people to play gaming. But this has got to stop. There's a real problem in the gaming community. And it has nothing to do with sexism.<|endoftext|>This is the third in a series of posts from my journey to being a Certified Nutritionist.

The next step is to become "complementary" to your body's own nutritional program, which includes working with a Registered Dietitian to ensure that your nutritional supplement(s) are the right ones for you.

A good example of this process is the use of "smart" supplements such as the Omega 3 capsules. Many individuals report reduced anxiety and depression post-treatment.

I have used Smart Supplements myself to help reduce anxiety (not necessarily depression), and I can confirm that they can help – in the right dose.

How to start Smart Supplementing

Smart Supplementing, and the use of smart supplements to treat symptoms of mood or anxiety disorders, generally began with the use of probiotics. Probiotics are "good micro-organisms" that are believed to produce benefits for mental health. For example, one study of probiotic use showed benefit for anxiety (in combination with a standard antidepressant).

Probiotics are often used in conjunction with nutritional supplementation. For example, a study found an increase in quality of life among participants after taking a combination with omega 3 (including EPA and DHA), magnesium, and taurine.

But what about the use of Omega 3 capsules? This form of supplementation is not recommended for any general mental health population.

"I think that he would say that in this context. He's going to let his leadership, his instincts dictate what he makes decisions and what actions we take, and that's all he would say," the official told ABC.


"He's looking at it as a very serious situation, he's in regular contact with intelligence, Homeland Security, the Department of State, and he's looking at it as an intentional act taken by these two terrorists."


At least five US citizens -- including citizen Anil Sathienth of Ann Arbor, Michigan -- were among Wednesday's casualties, the State Department confirmed today.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with these American citizens," State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told journalists in Washington.

"Our embassy staff -- many of whom are still in Afghanistan -- are now being relocated, and our personnel working there are very concerned that they may not be able to come home as quickly as they're comfortable with."

The Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik, said there was no evidence that terrorists were behind the attack. "What I know is they are terrorists," he told a press conference in Islamabad.

"We have not said this is a drone. We have said it was two terrorists, we have not said it was an unmanned aircraft."

Malik admitted that drones were sometimes spotted, but the Pakistan government did not know for sure if any drone footage or other details of the attack had been obtained by the Pakistan Taliban.

Earlier, the government said it was "confident" that the drones were flying over the Pakistan Taliban stronghold at night, but admitted that there had been no official confirmation from the US.


US officials declined to comment on reports that the drone launched a missile on the car.


Earlier, an Afghan official said a group of women were among those killed.

"They were civilians," says Anwara.

"At that time, all of a sudden all the women from our family stopped the car because they heard that it is a US drone, that US drone fired one missile. One woman who was sitting behind them was killed. Four other women and one child were wounded. There are five dead bodies already. Four of them are women.

"We are now trying to make funeral arrangements for all the women we can get. We want the US to bring them with the body."

An earlier report from the Associated Press suggested the women were a group of Afghan schoolteachers who had driven from a madrassa in Kandahar province to an Afghan shrine.


Tariq Mahmood, the director of the Human Rights Office of the Ministry of Communications in Pakistan, told The New York Times the Taliban had executed the civilians after they refused to give them money (or take some kind of prisoner) before shooting them with their Kalashnikovs.


An Afghan witness told the AP the Taliban wanted to shoot one man, but instead they opened fire while he was walking down the back alleyway.

"They ordered the woman to lie down next to one of their dead comrades, then shot all of them," said the man, who asked to remain anonymous.

Abdul Salam, the father of one of the victims, said the family had been in Afghanistan for more than a year but was returning home tonight. "I am shocked. My heart has dropped but my spirit still stands," he said.


"I saw only one of the people who were executed. He was walking towards the road. He didn't see me. He didn't see my son, but when he saw us he was surprised and he got down, he started to cry. He was crying because he knew we could not understand."


He said all the bodies had been brought into his house on the first floor. "I don't know if the Taliban or the government has identified the people. It's sad."<|endoftext|>The following piece was written for the website of the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) titled "The War Against the Rohingya" that details the state of human rights in Rakhine state, Burma. While I cannot speak for the UNODA, I believe this piece to be representative of general viewpoints on the human rights situation in Rakhine.

What is the state of play for the 2016 presidential election? For many people, the answer is a blank one.

The Democratic and Republican Parties have been locked in a battle for more than a year, with the Democrats having the most to lose. If Democrats are to capture the White House in November, one of their candidates will have to win the majority of the popular vote. But despite President Obama's efforts to mobilize the Democratic base, many Democratic politicians are reluctant to run on their party's label, even if, at the same time, they are critical of their own Party.

One reason for this is that many politicians fear appearing "weak" or "clumsy" if they run on Obama's name. Obama has been in the White House for most of these six years, giving him greater control over the party apparatus than his two immediate predecessors. If, however, a Democratic president had lost the 2008 presidential election to Republican Senator John McCain, his party would have been in serious peril. The party was torn and disempowered, and any Democrat who would have followed in Clinton's footsteps would face a difficult reelection campaign. But instead, Obama's victory ushered in new challenges among Democrats. "We had an environment in which if you lost an election, if you were a Democrat … it's very, very hard to find yourself again," Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said in an interview last year. "We needed to have a really bold vision and a leader who came in very directly from the center and said, hey, let's go big in a different direction and get this done, or else we're going to go the way of the Whigs."

Still, Democrats are not on offense during the 2016 primary process. "There are so many Democrats who are nervous about their image, because that's the only tool they have to go toe-to-toe with whoever they want to go toe-to-toe with," said Tad Devine, a longtime Democratic consultant. Instead, Devine said that the Republican Party has largely been left to the side. "What has happened is that Republicans have been getting the lion's share of airtime, and Democrats have just kind of been relegated to the sidelines. This is not necessarily an advantage for Democrats. The one advantage Democrats can claim is that the Republicans have not had to spend any money on television this cycle. There are all of the major candidates and the Republican Party — the party as a whole — has been in a panic mode."<|endoftext|>This article is adapted from the American Psychological Association's 2014 Ethics in Psychotherapy Report.

Elder abuse is the abuse of an elder or resident and is defined by the American Association of Suicidology as "repeated use of emotional or physical coercion to control, frighten, or threaten" an elder or resident. Elder abuse may include threats by members of a caregiver's family or by other caregivers of their family, the use of violence, threats, or other intimidating methods of control, or other forms of pressure.

Elder abuse is common in the psychiatric community. While it is not uncommon for a person to be the subject of abuse, it is not necessarily a form of mental illness. Elder abuse is often perpetrated by members of a caregiver's family, by a resident's caretakers, or by other caregivers of the resident.

Elder abuse may occur in one caregiver's home or family, in a nursing home, a mental hospital, a residential care facility, or in a group home, assisted living, or assisted living facility. (See figure 1). While people are different, some caregivers may suffer from elder abuse, which makes them less capable of caring for an elder with respect to personal care, and may contribute to higher rates of elder abuse.1

This report presents findings from the first 10 years of a National Incidence Study (NIS) of elder abuse in the United States.2 The NIS aims to monitor and understand the extent and nature of elder abuse in the United States. Elder abuse is an integral part of the health care system, and is responsible for up to 60 percent of medical emergency room visits and 50 percent of hospitalizations in nursing homes and other residential facilities.3

The National Incidence Study of Elder Abuse

The NIS, the first 10 years, examined reported elder abuse incidents in nursing homes and other residential facilities.4 This annual national study of 1,000 nursing home residents and 1,000 community residents is conducted every five years. Because of the long-term nature of the study, the NIS uses data collected over more than nine years.

In 2016, the NIS included incidents of elder abuse in all nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the United States.5 The NIS found that elder abuse in this research period, from 2005 through 2015, was reported in 574 nursing homes and 615 communities (in communities not owned and operated by public health departments). The NIS also found that more than two-thirds (68.

Pete Evans / Getty Images Actor/director Peter Jackson sits at a news conference with fellow executives, the producers of the upcoming film The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on August 30, 2013

(Editor's note: This post has been updated several times to reflect the latest information available.)

Update: Tolkien Estate and Trust has confirmed that a "substantial investment" has been made in the restoration of The Lord of the Rings. A press release announcing the news reads as follows:

The Tolkien Estate and Trust confirms that a substantial investment has been made in an important component of The Lord of the Rings, the restoration of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy.

Although the full financial details remain confidential, a statement accompanying the news confirms this significant investment. The news comes on the same day the estate and film studio signed a definitive license agreement for an extended Trilogy as a motion picture and for subsequent television, book and audio-visual releases.

The Tolkien Estate and Trust is very appreciative of the considerable efforts made by the directors of the film and, indeed, everyone involved with the production. I can assure you that there will be further improvements in the final stages of the project, particularly in quality.

A further statement was made at yesterday's premiere of the new Hobbit films at New Zealand's Te Papa Museum of Art, in Wellington. Director Peter Jackson said, "While the entire team has had amazing opportunities in this incredibly talented group of professionals, we are delighted to have the support of The Tolkien Estate…it's a wonderful day to be part of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit."

Original post continues below:

As reported by various news sources following the release of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey earlier this month, Peter Jackson has spent $130,000 on restoring The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The project seems to be on track with The Hobbit films having received a more modest and low key makeover after the events of The Desolation of Smaug.

A press release issued by the Tolkien Estate states that this is the first time a full-length motion picture has been shot on this scale. "With its special effects enhanced by digital wizardry and practical effects as well as CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) created in New Zealand, this is the high-stakes filmmaking experience of a lifetime," says Michael Arndt, the first director of photography on The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. "And, of course, it offers Peter Jackson's film-making wizards an opportunity to create a new version of Middle-earth that perfectly captures the spirit and sweep of the book series," Arndt adds, adding, "Every scene here has been a painstakingly studied study of Tolkien's vivid world" and the production staff has "worked ceaselessly to faithfully recreate the world of J.R.R. Tolkien as conceived by JRR Tolkien himself."

The announcement of the restoration also confirms the details of the deal made by the filmmakers to receive "continuous worldwide distribution rights to the film trilogy." Tolkien Estate and Trust representatives would not divulge if this new version will have any additional added special effects or would be a straight re-release of the films.

While the details of how the money has been raised has yet to be revealed, the press release issued by the Tolkien Estate in conjunction with the announcement reads as follows: "The Tolkien Estate and Trust announces that Peter Jackson and his production company, New Line Cinema, have signed a definitive license agreement with the Tolkien Estate and Trust to receive continuing worldwide distribution rights to The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

"The decision to purchase such significant distribution rights marks an impressive commitment and testament to both the high quality of the production and the value to the worldwide Tolkien community.

"A substantial investment by The Tolkien Estate and Trust and other partners and a team that includes the film makers has been made in the restoration and preservation of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and its accompanying feature-length motion picture.

"While the precise nature of this investment has yet to be disclosed, it is estimated by many to be in the range of $130,000,000. Although this is a substantial commitment by all concerned, it is a relatively new form of investment which can only be made by individuals or foundations that have substantial resources and are willing to invest."

This marks the second time in a few weeks news has been released pertaining to the restoration of the three films, following a deal made in December between the Walt Disney Company and the Tolkien Estate to "revive the trilogy as a film trilogy from the original trilogy."

An international team of scientists, led by David Grinspoon at the Colorado School of Mines, has revealed a previously unknown giant planet. Called Planet 9, the object is 10 times the mass of Earth and located more than 30 billion kilometres from Earth.

Unlike previous confirmed Kuiper Belt objects, Planet 9 is so large that it blocks part of the Milky Way, thus making it a giant in its own right.

"We have found a giant planet with no known satellites and a very eccentric orbit, both of which we have never before seen in a KBO," Dr Grinspoon told The Guardian.

The Kuiper Belt, consisting of three huge objects between the orbits of Neptune and Uranus, contains an estimated 50-100 Jupiter-sized planets across an enormous region of space. However, despite its importance for planetary scientists, the Kuiper Belt is not always explored. Since the 1950s, several space probes have failed to make it through its narrow belt.

"No spacecraft ever has made it through the inner edge of the Kuiper Belt, but several missions have approached the outer edge of our solar system, reaching the edge of the asteroid belt," said Grinspoon.

A major issue with probing the outer edge of the Kuiper Belt is that the distance to the Kuiper Belt is so vast that even small objects are too large to be captured.

In order to get a larger sample of objects, NASA's NEOWISE probe, which orbited the Kuiper Belt from 2010-2013, was sent to hunt down the smallest objects in the region, all of which were detected and tracked down by the spacecraft.

However, the space telescope found itself restricted to the Kuiper Belt region by the distances of its orbits.

In this new study, the team used a special high-precision telescope to detect small, distant exoplanets with a radius of up to 1.2 times that of Earth.

It is estimated that the Kuiper Belt has about 1,000 planets that are between 0.2 and 10 times Earth's mass, with about 500-2000 larger planets that exist at more than 10 times Earth's radius. This means that only the larger, more distant objects could be captured or observed by the Kuiper Telescope.

The planet was discovered on April 11th 2016, by the team including Dr John G. Martin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the University of Geneva and Dr Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

It was originally known as KOI-26 (pronounced Kai-e-dee-see) and was later redefined as the planet Proxima b.

Proxima b was previously predicted by GRB 130427B, also known as PSR B14027-6035, to be the first exoplanet to be born about 4.58 billion years ago — roughly 100 to 350 million years after the solar system was born. There are several theories on Proxima b's origin, including its impact with the inner solar system, some giant planet collision or disruption, and a planet-forming disk of gas located in the outer edges of our solar system — essentially a cloud of gas and dust which can produce stars. Regardless of such theories, the Kuiper Belt is an ideal candidate for Proxima b's formation and discovery because the objects are in a very distant region of the universe and therefore hard to reach via current space flight.

The planet is located near the star that surrounds Proxima Centauri, which is named for the Proxima Centauri system, which is known from the stars of this system in the night sky around the night sky above the northern hemisphere of our galaxy. It lies approximately twice as far away from Proxima Centauri as the Earth is from the sun.<|endoftext|>There are several theories about what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and the most common one involves the pilot intentionally crashing the plane after he realized his "perfect day" had disappeared.

21st Century Wire says…

Is this the beginning of a new Cold War between the West and Russia?

From their recent confrontation in a Ukrainian airport, we can now add yet another "dispute" into this already busy global political theatre…

The BBC reports that the Turkish president has threatened to send in troops to halt a crackdown by his country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The BBC quotes the Turkish president as saying, "If someone wants to do something, let them be ready for everything. No one will stand aside."

He then elaborated that if he had the option to intervene, he would now go ahead – but "that is not the choice I have now… I will wait and see what decisions [are] taken in the future."

When President Erdogan first announced his threat, the response from the West was very different. A very serious warning was issued by the German government.

The Guardian stated: "A warning was issued for Ankara by Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, who vowed to do whatever it takes to avert a military escalation."

In recent days, the West has been escalating the rhetoric, pushing Russia to intervene militarily in a country where there are over 40,000 Russian troops, while also threatening to punish anyone that dares to support Russian troops.

This is just one example of an endless barrage of threats and accusations being fired at Russia.

Last year, an Israeli spokesperson famously warned Russia to "get out of Syria," claiming that 'a civil war' is brewing there, while the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was blamed on "al Qaeda in Iraq".

If Russia decides to intervene, this could escalate into a nuclear war…

A new report suggests that many of them lived around the same elementary schools as the young victims.

The children have been diagnosed with Enterovirus D68, and it's suspected they may have contracted the virus following exposure to the same bodily fluids as the elderly and the very young. So far, there has been no widespread transmission to any adults or other members of the community.

The virus causes a mild illness characterized by fever, headache and muscle aches. Among those infected, more than 200 have died and nearly 40 have become severely ill in hospitals since December. As the CDC notes, the strain that sickened them "is very similar to an influenza A virus."

The disease is more common in the spring, but it's been found in the fall and early winter. It's primarily associated with children, but has also been documented in adults. And because infections occur mostly among children, it's likely to have an impact on schools.

There are currently at least 50 cases reported with about 70 cases potentially being linked to the same person, according to a report released by the CDC, which says it is working with state health departments to investigate any new infections.<|endoftext|>When we first began, most people only had an idea of the basics. Most of us had never been on a motorcycle, but were just looking to have some fun riding around in the streets. This wasn't unusual. Most of us got our bikes new, so we could enjoy riding, then kept them as long as possible.


There are many benefits of riding motorcycles. One of the most common are the freedom and independence that can come with riding a motorcycle. You can live, or travel, and have fun wherever you travel, rather than staying at home. Motorcycling creates a very active lifestyle. It is a way out of the rat race. It gives you the opportunity to find your own style, and set your own limits. When a motorcycle is in your hand, life can't get much better.


However, there are many challenges that motorcyclists face. These challenges range from technical to safety to maintenance. Most of us just take the challenges of riding motorcycles for what they are. We are able to use our riding skills to deal with the problems as they occur. Our experiences and knowledge help us overcome common problems that we encounter at every turn, without ever realizing that we have any problems.

How motorcyclists deal with problems is a great question, and one that requires a lot of thought to answer. Some of the thoughts that come to mind may not apply to you, so I'll try to explain some of the ideas that help motorcyclists to get through the tough times. For example, you may feel that your riding skill and riding skills are better than the average person. But if you aren't willing to do the work, and commit to getting better

In August of 2005, the world became aware of the fact that a human being had been in space for over six months. Though the story is still shrouded in mystery the most widely known information is that John Glenn became the longest-serving American space traveler when he returned to Earth in February, 1962.

In fact, this is true of all the people who have been in space throughout human history as well as every person for whom we have records and has been in space since the world's birth. The same holds true for those who have been in space in the past week and who also remain in space. The more we know about these people and their experiences, the broader our understanding of their role in the world around us (and their role in human history).

The list of people who flew in missions that lasted more than one day can take all sorts of shapes and sizes but is always impressive in total length. In the years following the original Apollo era when we launched people into orbit and later into space for long periods of time, people were launched and in space for short periods of time. Here are a some of the most famous space travelers in history.

Of course, the very first person to ever hit the ground on an airplane when it was actually landing was a pilot named Captain James Cook during an ill-fated attempt to break the record for the longest flight of any manned aircraft on the Eastern Coast of the U.S. Cook's flight lasted over seven hours and twenty minutes and set the all-time land-flight record at the time (the previous record holder was a Spanish Air Force pilot named Francisco "Pancha" Rodriguez who flew an aircraft from Madrid, Spain to Marseille in France in July, 1957 at the age of only twenty-two years and four months, for only eleven hours and fifteen minutes). The record stood for more than twenty years.

A few years later, two other pilots attempted to break Cook's record. Both attempts were thwarted by poor weather and bad weather conditions. The only other person to fly in an airplane in space before Cook was the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who was launched aboard Vostok 1 to become the first human in space. He was successfully returned to Earth and landed in a Russian landing craft on August 17, 1962 in a little over six-and-a-half hours, twenty minutes and twenty seconds into his mission. Gagarin was actually considered a contender to surpass Cook's record before he was lost in the Apollo 1 fire of 1961.

The last long-duration flight aboard the Space Shuttle was an eight-day mission in 1995 in which a Russian Soyuz capsule launched and a crew of seven, including three Americans, embarked on a space walk. That mission was considered a critical milestone in the history of the space program because it demonstrated shuttle rendezvous, docking and berthing on orbit of the International Space Station.

For six months, a Russian Soyuz rocketed the crew and research equipment to a 200-mile orbit. On September 9, 2000, the Russian shuttle Mir reentered the atmosphere and landed with a spectacular splash in the Pacific Ocean, a successful return that was only possible thanks to a combination of luck and engineering prowess.

And since that year, the International Space Station has been populated by twelve astronauts. Though the U.S. government has a limited role in the design, construction, and operation of the space station, it has participated in the building of a huge docking unit capable of docking two of them simultaneously. It has also been responsible for a series of repairs to the station since its construction and has worked to protect it from a large number of space debris, a problem that could cripple its ability to send a crew to other planets and return them safely alive.

In fact, the number of people who have ever been in orbit or worked inside the International Space Station is so high that in order to reduce the number who have to work out of sight while on station, most station dwellers are expected to rotate in and out of the Space Station every two weeks, something that is very disruptive for the people who are doing important work during this time. It is not unusual for someone at the station to wake up and find that they don't have an apartment to live in. And during every rotation, the rest of the station crew has to share their living quarters with anyone who is up and not working. The rotation program is called the "fast cycle" because the work on the Station tends to slow down and sometimes stop if there are no new people to fill those positions.

Over the years I've been fortunate enough to travel to space in the Soviet Union, the United States, and the European Space Agency. My primary reason for being in space was to see Earth and learn more about its geography, and that's what I did for twelve years. Even though I worked on missions that span several days and sometimes stretched over five hours, all the trips were amazing, inspiring and inspiring

Fears of a new North Korean nuclear war heightened on Thursday, as the Obama administration released a new round of economic sanctions targeting a number of people, in an effort to tighten the screws and compel the regime to return to talks.


US officials said they have confirmed that the North Korean army has deployed an anti-aircraft missile, the Pukguksong-1. In recent weeks, US warplanes began to fly a special training mission near the North Korean border, according to the New York Times.


With economic pressure mounting, North Korea has been increasingly bellicose in recent weeks, threatening to fire missiles near Guam and South Korea.

Speaking at the UN Security Council on Thursday, US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power described the situation as "baffling."


While the situation is unlikely to spark a new international crisis, Power said that "the regime clearly is not ready to negotiate."


"We have seen what a nuclear North Korea unleashes on the world on the face of a country that is already reeling from more than two decades of poverty and deprivation," Power said.


"With the leadership under a nuclear threat, the North Korean people need not stand in the way of an open, free and peaceful North Korea – for the regime can and will fall sooner if people are told to do so," she added.

US officials said the economic sanctions will be designed to "cut off sources of cash and energy that North Korea depends on for its military and political survival, and that contribute to its nuclear and missile programs."

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned on Thursday that Washington was ready to use force if North Korea goes to war.


Kerry said if the North "uses weapons of mass destruction against the United States or our allies like South Korea or Japan, we are prepared to act immediately and decisively."

US warships in the Pacific are also prepared to shoot if attacked by missile or air, he added.


Pyongyang has previously threatened "preemptive nuclear strikes" on US and South Korean cities. However, the US has ruled out any military strike against the the North's nuclear facilities, saying the goal is to coerce a diplomatic resolution.<|endoftext|>A few days ago, there was a new story of a child being sexually abused by an adult male relative (in this case an estranged brother). The story was picked up in one of my favorite sites, The Washington Post.

I started reading the post, but the paragraph I want to focus on happened right before the second paragraph of the post:

For a moment, the man sat on the couch, and the child sat on the floor, his head down. The man took his belt off and bound the child's hands. The child had been beaten in the forehead with a belt. A knife had been stuck into his groin.

What I want to talk about is the word "kicked." It's a powerful word: it is associated with the worst things that can happen to a person. In the story, it seemed like the father's use of the word kicked was a good thing; after all, it was an act of violence that was intended to hurt the child. But what does the word "kicked" really mean? Are we being told that the act was justified because the child deserved it (not only based on his or her past transgressions, but also based on the child's own history of being abused)? As I've written about many times before, the word "kicked" is generally defined as

the act of striking, or the movement of something, by an instrument, such as a sword, a club, a fist, or some other kind of object, in such a manner as to produce pain or injury

In short, you give someone a kick and they'll hurt or be hurt . It's the opposite of giving someone a hug or slapping them.

So why is the word kicked being used as an act of violence by a father or uncle?

A few moments after that paragraph, we learned what we have come to know for a long time: "abuse" is not something that comes and goes; we're all victims of abuse whether we know it, don't realize it, or admit it. This should be a very comforting story, but it's not.

"He kicked me with his boot and gave me a bad slap with a stick." "He said, 'if I ever see you, I kick you in your head.'" "I did what he told me to do, and it wasn't the way I wanted to."

That's right, kids! "He kicked and beat me in the house." "He wanted to show me his kicks."

I know a lot of you are probably thinking (and crying), "yeah, that's pretty gross, I'd like to have my own kick to the head!" Well, maybe you wouldn't like it if someone showed

For a man who has spent nearly three decades at the top of the American power structure, the recent revelation that his brother Bill, a former Arkansas governor, tried to broker an illegal deal with Iran is an unfortunate but perhaps unavoidable bit of bad news. If it is true, as U.S. officials suspect, that Iran's former president and current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was the mastermind of the deal and that it is his top deputy who is still in Iran, then a whole host of very bad things must follow. Here are just a few of them, beginning with the obvious:

The current president of the United States will leave office in nine days, and the Republican candidate will win the general election just a few weeks later. This, on top of a potential Iran nuclear deal which, if it is implemented, would bring the world some form of economic stability and allow us to spend some of those billions that we might have spent on fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in a much more prudent way, would make a great deal of difference. We will have a much healthier and hopeful presidency, the country will be far more prepared to confront the terrorist threat that hangs over our country, and more willing to work with other countries — including Russia — to work towards a more peaceful world.

But that is only part of the bad news. The other major impact would be the end of the Iran nuclear deal. In the days leading up to the announcement that the deal was finally coming undone, we all had to take a deep breath. Obama is not a perfect president, but in the last decade he has achieved far more than any of his predecessors at the same stage in their presidencies. And when he signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which I have also signed into law, in Congress, that is probably the best example of his mastery of Congress.

But as we all know now, nothing works in Obama's world, and he just does not give up. In this instance, he apparently decided to have one last stand rather than face the fact that his successor would probably be a much different kind of president — one who did not want any deal at all, or perhaps had lost track of the fact that the United States had struck two major deals with Tehran in the last two years that put our relationships with Iran at the top of the list of issues we would face in the future. It had never occurred to him that we might find out about this deal through the Iranians, that perhaps this was something he could be forced to deal with over his remaining time in office — a possibility that did not even occur to him.

No matter how you look it, the Iran deal was a great missed opportunity for Obama, because for so long it has been his model for doing business in the Middle East — a success story without parallel except in a fantasy landscape. It was, at its core, a failure.

We know this because even Obama admitted it. He was not the first president to reach out to Iran, he said in his 2013 State of the Union speech, but by all accounts, as my colleague Matt M. Lee reported for the New York Times, he was the first president to try to force Tehran into a deal. Obama's Iran deal, he said, was "the toughest sanction regime in history," a "turning point" for U.S. foreign policy and a "game changer in the Middle East." "The Iranians have begun their shift," he added, "but before it is complete we must continue to act, and we will."

But, according to the White House disclosures, what Obama was doing was trying to make the United States look tough and to make himself look like an international statesman. But what he actually did was force the United States to deal with a rogue regime who had repeatedly violated the spirit and letter of international norms, and in the process created an extremely real threat to our credibility as a broker for resolving international disputes, as well as potentially even an existential threat to the existence of the United States.

And if there is to be any comfort to American taxpayers, it ought to be that it was the Iranians whose expectations were way higher than those of Obama's administration because this was all about them — this is what was at stake. The Iranian nuclear program was on their radar screen because they knew that whatever it was they were doing was designed to put a stop to the American policy of containment in the region. They knew the Americans were doing all sorts of other stuff against them, they just could not figure out what it was. But now, as a result of the deal they were forced to sign with Obama, they now have a sense of what American interests were and where they stood. They know that they might have been wrong to bother with them in the past. Now they realize that it is the United States with whom they must negotiate.

Indeed, it is not just Iranians who now see the United States as a reliable and trustworthy broker on the

For a man who's been dead for decades, the thought of a life after life is a pretty radical concept. There's a world out there after death and, as our friend Robert Anton Wilson said, it's full of dark wonders like The Wizard Of Oz; it also contains a lot of weirdness, even for a dead man

No one ever said that one should never contemplate death. In fact, it's more important than ever, because no one knows when it will end anyway. If it does end it'll come abruptly, like a blow to the head. If you're lucky it'll take the form of a gentle tap on the shoulder, or the occasional yawn.

But all of that is relative. What's really important is what is happening now, what is happening to you now, what is occurring at this very moment. I hope you'll be listening to this show, even if it's just for a moment.

I also hope you'll be thinking about all the people you love. The ones who are still in your life. Everyone you love.

And I also hope you'll be thinking about that wonderful place out there. I hope you'll be thinking about where we are now and what we need to be doing about it. And finally I hope you'll be thinking and feeling about those things out there that we just can't comprehend, cannot possibly see, cannot necessarily measure, cannot possibly explain, cannot possibly understand. Those things we simply cannot fathom.

But they are real. They are always real. And because they are real, it is possible to live, to have meaning, to learn, to grow, to change the world. The world cannot be fixed, it can only be molded and changed. It cannot be ruled, it can only be influenced, it can only be shaped. And what I'm trying to tell this listener is that it doesn't get any easier because it doesn't get any easier to become someone else.

I'd like to give you a little advice, too. And you may not even be able to understand it.

I want to tell you that it's okay to take some time off. It's okay to let go.

And I want to tell you that if you stop to think about it long enough, you'll find yourself feeling better than you've ever felt before. You're stronger than you've ever been or perhaps ever will be again. You're no longer broken, your life is your own.

But you need to realize that everything I just asked you to do has now turned into a very real goal that you're working toward.

Maybe you just stop and start listening. Maybe you listen to your friend for a little while, or to the guy down the street, or to yourself. Maybe you turn on your favorite podcast. Maybe you read a book. Maybe you even write… or more likely, you just stop and look at this picture.

Whatever it is you decide to do, just remember this.

There is a great big world out there waiting for you.

A world that you never thought we'd ever see again.

If you keep doing what we're doing right now, and you don't stop, there is a possibility. That possibility is not slim. It's not improbable. It's not even unlikely. In fact, it's a certainty.

If this happens, if a man with a name like Bob Marley who died 70 years ago and left us a musical legacy that continues to live today can actually have a life after this one, if a man who had no intention of ever living having gone around telling people to "turn on their dreams to come true" can have that life, you'll know you were born to live and live to live because that's the world that awaits you.

So just keep going, keep working as hard as you can, keep talking and talking and talking and working even harder. And I hope you live long – I mean, actually, really long.

We're so lucky to have you. So keep going and I wish you the best.

That's all for this week's show.

See you next time, friends.<|endoftext|>1

It has been reported that "The new 'Star Trek: Discovery' pilot is a reboot of the 'Star Trek' franchise, but we already knew that. And, even if it were a reboot, the new show will be a completely different story in its own way.

The episode titles, released today by CBS, reveal that the show will start from scratch and "tell a new story set in the Kelvin Timeline."

Also Read: CBS Sets New Premiere Dates for 'Star Trek: Discovery' and 'Vikings'

The 'Star Trek' TV series began on NBC in September 1966. The television series ran for six seasons and won three Emmy awards for Outstanding Drama Series, while it spawned several sequels, spin-offs and even feature films (not to mention novels).

The franchise, which aired on CBS between 1966 and 1969, was rebooted with the 2007 relaunch of the television series' television show.

"The 'Star Trek' universe will continue with 'Star Trek: Discovery,' set 500 years before the adventures of the U.S.S. Enterprise and the original cast – Captains James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy and Data – in the prime universe. This new series will pick up where the existing series left off, as Capt. Michael Burnham and crew embark on their first mission together, and the crew prepares for their biggest mission yet: exploring new worlds and new possibilities as the U.S.S. Shenzhou heads out into uncharted space.

The show will be produced by MGM Television and CBS Television Studios in association with Alex Kurtzman's Secret Hideout, Bryan Fuller's Living Dead Guy Productions and Roddenberry Productions. Fuller is set to direct the pilot. (Fuller's producing credits include the Star Trek films and Battlestar Galactica.) Kurtzman will serve as a showrunner and executive producer. Fuller had announced in July that he was departing from the project, which he had been hired to write.

Fellow bar patrons are understandably not happy.

On Wednesday, PhillyMagazine.com spoke with owner Bill D'Amico, who, unlike most bar owners, has been charged with a crime.

D'Amico, 42, has been charged with aggravated indecent assault after video footage of the incident was posted to YouTube and picked up by The Philadelphia Inquirer.

The video, which was recorded in April, shows D'Amico and several men pulling women from a bar and groping them. All but one of the encounters involve the women's faces being obscured by their hair. The bar patron in the photo above is the only one who is identified.

D'Amico, who has been open since 2000, denies the allegations.

"It's all lies," he told PhillyMuse. "I've been sued for false arrest and things like that. It's all slander."

D'Amico says he doesn't even own a TV, let alone a camera. (In response to a question about whether he has a cell phone, he said, "No," and then hung up the phone.)

Here's the video (warning: foul language, explicit language, and inappropriate sexual behavior):

The alleged incident started in a bar called the Hacienda (which also serves as The Drunken Unicorn):

D'Amico says there was only one customer who was involved in the attack but that she did not cooperate. He adds that he has not personally known the woman for two years.

The Philly Inquirer reached out to the alleged victim with the same question about her relationship with D'Amico but didn't hear back.

According to a police report, a police officer spotted D'Amico and one of the victims at 9:30 p.m. near 8th and Walnut Streets, watching a street fight. The officer arrested D'Amico for disorderly conduct.

In this article, I would like to share with you my experience with the following technologies and applications. This article is purely my personal opinion.

Let's get started.

First and foremost, let's talk about the basics, such as:

What are we doing ?

When do we need it ?

What do we use it for ?

Some of the most common use cases for REST APIs include:

Scheduling jobs and other long running processes

Saving important data like ticket purchases or flight status

Managing complex business rules for billing/customer support or inventory management

Creating or verifying a connection to a database

Retrieving data from an API from an external service

Creating custom reports and maps

Analyzing data

If we think about such usage cases, then our goal in this exercise is to build, implement and deploy an API to solve a specific business problem (let's consider only this example scenario).

Also, some of you might remember my previous article entitled, "The Complete Guide to building an API". This blog post is going to focus on the implementation, not the development of the API.

Some of the features that we will get to learn in this article:

JSON

CORS

AJAX

GSON/JSON

MVC and Mapper

REST in ASP.NET Core

As you can see, ASP.NET Core is a great framework for building APIs in a more robust way. In fact, it actually makes development of APIs much easier.

I'm assuming you've created a GitHub account if you haven't yet…

The most important thing before we jump into the code is a simple project.

Open Visual Studio to create and open your first ASP.NET Core project. When it asks if you want to allow the project to use the global project variables, you should answer 'no' because we're going to use these settings for later.

Creating a project (C#/ASP.NET Core)

So we've created a new project as part of the tutorial.

Navigate to your solution folder and open the Microsoft.AspNetCore namespace.

In a code editor, open Main.cs file.

If the project already exists, create a new class under it and name it 'HelloController'. Also create a new class under the 'Web' namespace called 'HelloController'.

In the code editor, create a new class in the 'Controller' namespace. Name it 'NewHelloController'. You can rename the file, but we won't do that here.

Let's add a HelloController.cs file. This is where we will define the API endpoint we're going to use. You can do many different endpoint options as well, but this is the only one that's going to do things right.

Add the following code under the following file:

public class NewHelloController : ApiController { public string GetPost(string url, string title) { var user = await Request.GetHttpUser(url); return "{" + user.FullName + "}"; } }

Save and open up the newly created 'HelloController.cs' file.

You'll see the following code in the code and in the comments:

public class NewHelloController : ApiController { public string GetPost(string url, string title) { var user = await Request.GetHttpUser(url); return "{" + user.FullName + "}"; } }

Let's go over each line for a bit.

public NewHelloController(string url)

The first line specifies how we're going to define our class. It could be a public static class in Visual Studio or the class we create in the code editor.

public string GetPost(string url, string title)

This is how we are going to define the endpoint URL. This is the url we are making our request to.

var user = await Request.GetHttpUser(url);

The second line adds a function that accepts the input we're expecting. The GetPost method takes nothing but values. In this case, the user that returns in the response body will be that person we're looking for.

return "{" + user.FullName + "}";

Now comes the magic! We're using GSON in our example to parse the JSON we'll receive, to return the right string in our response.

The last line makes a substitution of the string that we'd gotten back from the server (using string concatenation). Finally, we get back our value.

So let's go over our example using the GSON library.

Create a new project and paste in the following code. This is where we'll define the endpoint:

A new online initiative is making sure patients can access information about which physicians are offering their services in their area.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it has partnered with the National Association of Health Underwriting Boards (NAHUB), a nonprofit association, to launch a web portal with information about providers. NAHUB operates the physician marketplace known as CarePilot. CarePilot is the first nationally recognized and accepted health insurance provider program and has a mission to improve and encourage the delivery of high-quality, affordable medical care statewide.

"Access to information is essential for the health care provider community," said H. Anthony Skinner, director of the Center for Comparative Insights in Health at the RAND Corporation.

"While there continue to be challenges to providing high quality, affordable care, many of the best solutions have been established in the marketplace, such as CarePilot," he added. "This initiative from the state of Connecticut is a great example of the results that can be achieved when public officials cooperate and work together."

In an effort to provide more and better access to quality care, the Department is launching the CarePilot platform to:

Promote high-quality and affordable health care by providing patient and provider access to information and resources;

Help patients and providers find physicians and health care facilities participating in the CarePilot program;

Improve transparency within the medical supply chain by sharing information about providers' services; and

Increase access to quality health care by increasing the number of providers and health care facilities in the CarePilot program.

"The health insurance industry needs to step up and take steps to expand participation in CarePilot," said Susan Murray, deputy commissioner for Connecticut. "The federal government has launched a major initiative to expand patient choice and quality, and we are committed to working with our state's health insurance providers and policymakers in the state to help them achieve this goal."

The Healthcare.gov website is expected to be operational by the fall of 2015.

An Islamist militant group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, has claimed responsibility for firing missiles at two hotels and a Peshawar-based hospital on Wednesday in an attack that injured 15, according to the group's leader.

The militant group, whose members used to be part of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, claimed responsibility for the strike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where a powerful explosion tore through the hotel's lobby.

Four people were killed in the explosion and 30 suffered severe injuries, hospital official Sohail Habibi told AFP.

"The attack was aimed at a VIP and his security detail and an aircraft was not hurt," Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police official Aftab Ahmed Hussain said.

In Peshawar, gunmen stormed a hospital run by the provincial government in the centre of the city and opened fire on patients and staff.

"We have been attacked but the hospital staff and patients are safe," said Dr Javed Akram, medical superintendent of the hospital.

He said the attack on the hospital was not linked to Tuesday's attack in the southwestern city of Peshawar, which claimed the lives of at least 80 people.

Sixty-one people died that day when Taliban militants and their allies launched an operation in the city to capture the provincial capital.

The hospital was under attack for the fifth times in the past three months after some 40 patients were attacked in 2015.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday's attack.

The latest assault happened more than a fortnight after Taliban gunmen killed 21 soldiers, seven policemen and an intelligence agent, in two separate attacks near the country's largest military base in Kunduz.

A local official in Kunduz said the hospital was targeted because its staff worked there.

The idea seems to be that, as a result of our lack of food, people are starting to think about what they can do to become self-sufficient, which means they are looking towards growing their own food and farming on an ongoing basis. So, with little to no food, and an abundance of land (due to being surrounded by nature), I guess it's not too surprising that they are looking to go it alone. I'm not sure if I agree with that completely. I don't see micro farming as a solution to

But how does the division stack up when you include all of the teams' games? According to my MLB Playoff Odds, the American League West is 11-12 in games decided by more than two runs this year. That's not only the most competitive division in baseball, but it also has the most games decided by more than one run this year of any division in baseball, and the most games decided by two or more runs in the sport.

I was going through a spreadsheet of all the games for the last week to see which division had the most games decided by one or two runs, just like we did last week for each division. So far this year, the American is in third place. I had to adjust the numbers on my MLB Playoff Odds spreadsheet to match last week's numbers. So the American is actually the winner.

I also compared how many of the division's games ended in an eight-run victory for all teams. The American and the NL Central are the two teams having the most one-run games of any of the divisions this year. The American was at 34, the Central at 23, and the NL West at 12. In total, the American is up to 40 one-run victories this year. The NL Central was close behind at 33, with the NL West finishing a whopping ninth with 27. The NL West is having a good year so far at 27 one-run victories. With two extra wins this year, the Nationals tie for the NL lead in one-run victories with the Brewers. But the Brewers have four one-run victories to the NL Central's three, so the division probably has the edge overall if we add the two to last week's totals.

Of course, the American hasn't exactly been a powerhouse this year, but that doesn't mean the divisions have been totally flat. It's easy to look at games decided by a single run and conclude that the American is a weak division. That's not the case at all. The American's first round opponent, the Texas Rangers, has lost both their games by a run this year. They have a three-game lead in the AL West going into their series with the San Francisco Giants this week.

If we look at all of the teams to lose by more than one run this season, the American leads them by two. A lot of divisions could use some pitching help.

I can't remember a year where so many three-run games have occurred, and it makes sense given the American's high-powered offense. The average opponent scored four runs in three of the four American losses we looked at this week. The Rangers are tied for 15th in runs of four or more in their games this season.

I was curious to know how well the American would match up against the other divisions. I looked at how all teams in the other divisions have fared against each other this year by looking at runs scored. So far, the American still ranks fifth overall in a division where the other division leads in runs scored by a huge margin.

The American's weakness against each of its divisions is probably because of their extreme pitching dominance. The American had a better offense against only the AL Central and the NL West than against the two AL East divisions (though the Yankees had the more impressive numbers). The average NL team has scored more runs than the American, but the average American team can't quite put more runs on the board than the NL West.

It may also be because of how the American has handled its pitching rotation. They have four guys at the top of the rotation that have a combined 1.92 ERA, and even though they have a low ERA in terms of FIP, their .240 batting average and .313 on-base percentage would tell you they've struggled.

The American hasn't exactly been a powerhouse this year. In fact, they'll have to be more than just a powerhouse to win this division. The American has the second lowest ERA and most run support in the league as well as the seventh-highest run differential in the American League. I'd expect the AL Central to win this season because

Two Chinese warships are set to complete repairs on the disputed South China Sea, Philippine officials say.

They also say Beijing has agreed to a Philippine proposal to allow two Chinese planes to take-off from the country's Bicol airport next month.

China has refused to take part in any joint patrols, but will send two military ships with more planes to the area if plans are confirmed.

The ships are expected to leave the country before the end of 2014.

Mr Abella has welcomed the ships' arrival in his country, telling reporters on Friday: "We hope to open a new chapter in our military relations."

He also said he was pleased that Beijing had agreed to allow the Philippines to establish a military base in Sabah, on Indonesia's east coast.

China claims most of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion (£3.2 trillion) in ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims there.

China's latest naval exercises, involving ships from the Eastern Fleet along a coastline 500km (300 miles) from the Philippines, have angered the US and other nations.

The Philippines said late on Tuesday the aircraft carrier Liaoning will begin "non-militarised" exercises on Friday at the port of Cebu, and complete operations in the Philippines after the holidays in April.

It will carry up to 100 personnel. The carrier itself will likely not see combat, Philippine defence officials say.

'Harmful influence'

Last month, Philippine officials said the navy had approved a Philippine military surveillance plane's use of a Philippines-registered civilian aircraft over the South China Sea.

The aircraft had taken-off from Philippine Air Force base on Palawan, the southern Philippine island where China has a large air defence identification zone (ADIZ).

Chinese state news agency Xinhua cited a Chinese defence ministry statement as saying the plane, carrying the personnel for the patrol, "exercised the rights and privileges of a civilian aircraft over the East China Sea".

Image copyright AFP Image caption Japan has criticised China's territorial claims in the South China Sea

The statement said the plane flew at a safe distance "in accordance with military regulations".

The Philippines says all nations should be able to "peacefully maintain lawful uses of maritime space, airspace, and shipping lanes, without harming the legitimate interests and well-being of third countries".

China insists it has sovereign rights to the region and has never ruled it out expanding its military patrols.

Earlier this year China called for a "neutral and responsible attitude" in the South China Sea during an "international conference" on freedom of navigation in the region.

It has also warned it would block military routes through it on the first day of the new year if demands for restraint are not met.

Japan, one of China's most steadfast allies, said at the time that it "completely opposes" such behaviour.

China has been building artificial islands and military installations on territory it occupied by force from the Philippines in the early 1970s

It claims nearly all of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion (£3.2 trillion) in ship-borne trade passes every year

Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims

China's coastguard ordered the US$3.7m (£2.4m) guided missile destroyer USS Dewey to sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed atoll last month

A Chinese navy ship has also been spotted in waters close to the Philippines in the same month

The Philippines says this latest Chinese move is part of an effort to intimidate it.

On Wednesday President Benigno Aquino called Chinese President Xi Jinping "irresponsible" during a closed-door Ulan Bator summit.

In another development, he called for stronger defence ties with Israel, saying he hoped "this is a first step" in improving relations.

He also raised concern about what he called "the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip which has created a humanitarian catastrophe".<|endoftext|>The next time you're watching a movie with your Netflix queue, here's some new info: When you open the app, you'll see a list of movies or TV shows that you have in queue, with the date you last watched each one.

The plasma blaster, known more commonly as a plasma assault rifle, is an energy weapon with a high rate of fire. It has the unique ability to disintegrate any material it collides with.

Contents show]

Background Edit

The plasma blaster is a unique energy weapon used by the Republic Special Forces. It appears in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Mandalorian Wars as the primary weapon of the Republic trooper known as the Lone Wanderer.

Characteristics Edit

A modified variant of the standard bolt-action laser rifle, the plasma gun can discharge a concentrated beam of high-energy particles. It has a high rate of fire, but is comparatively slow-firing due to the unique firing system. As well, its lack of an optics mount and an integrated targeting scope means that the rifle lacks a long-range scope, although it has the ability to hold the aiming crosshairs on enemy targets, thus potentially making it an excellent weapon for skirmishers.

Gameplay attributes Edit

Unlike the more conventional power laser rifle, the plasma blaster's rate of fire and high damage per unit of time, especially against shielded opponents, allow it to take down nearly any enemy within a relatively short timeframe. This allows players to keep their targets in sight as they advance, making long-range engagements less of a problem.

While the plasma blaster suffers from a lower rate of fire than the standard laser rifle, it has the highest damage per unit of time in the series, so it remains a reliable option despite its rate of fire. However, players should always keep in mind that plasma bolts are very powerful, so those with relatively small shields and very minimal armor are highly vulnerable to the beam.

Tactics Edit

In general, plasma rifles are best used against targets at close range, although this can be difficult due to the weapon's low fire rate. Players may consider it preferable to use the plasma bolt-based crosshairs. When aiming at a stationary target, it is recommended that the player put the crosshair on the torso or head to ensure accurate hits. Also the plasma launcher can be used to fire at moving turrets or other vehicles that are attempting to flank the player.

Be wary of nearby energy shields when facing plasma rifles as the resulting energy discharge will cause heavy heat damage to the player, regardless of shielding level and even if the shielded target was previously unshielded.

Inventory Edit

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Mandalorian Wars Edit

Behind the scenes Edit

The plasma blaster's design was inspired by a comic book series called New Exiles, a short comic book series written by J.M. DeMatteis and published by Dark Horse Comics from 2004 to 2008.

Although it is not a weapon in the "official" video games, the weapon appears in Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords and Jedi Knight, in the Massassi warrior faction. The weapon is the "Warrior of Flame" (in this particular character class it is referred to as "Fire-Brand") with two other variants, one is the "Fire-Brand Warrior" with orange-bladed plasma bolts.

The player can use the energy pistol or pulse grenades as their primary weapons in battle. The weapon's lack of an optic sight is a drawback but does not prevent it from being used at long-range by many characters.

The speech by Education Secretary Michael Gove to the Institute for Fiscal Studies has been branded "misleading".

Mr Gove set out Tory plans to create new skills schools and to force secondary schools to promote "British values".

But former deputy PM Lady Warsi has said he has "got it right" when it comes to Labour's education record.

But Labour said the speech "clearly shows an obsession with ideology and a lack of interest in getting the facts right".

A spokesman for former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett said: "Michael Gove seems to have been looking for something to fit his Tory Party's rigid narrative."

In a speech to the fiscal policy think tank in Edinburgh, Mr Gove said more than 100,000 children were currently being taught in schools which are no longer capable of preparing them for life in this modern industrial society.

A young woman was hit by a car in New Orleans Saturday evening. News 3 did a live report from the scene and found out who the victim is.

Police said the 28-year-old is the second female pedestrian to be hit by a car in New Orleans this summer.

The crash happened around 5:30 p.m. on the 1900 block of Louisa Street.

Witness, Brian Ritchie, said he was on his way home from work when he saw a man running down the block with the car behind him.

"I heard this car screeching and the door open and I thought the guy had gone to get the gun and it was a girl laying there and I was screaming, 'You got to stop that, they're running into the street,'" Ritchie said.

Police confirmed the 28-year-old female is the first victim of vehicular manslaughter hit by a car in 2016.

The 27-year-old driver was arrested and charged with hit and run, possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of marijuana.

Ritchie said he is shocked another young lady was killed for not paying attention when she was walking down the street.

"I've been here 30 years and this makes me angry," Ritchie said. "This makes me mad for the next lady who's in danger."<|endoftext|>From the National Geographic:

A new study shows that the global rise in sea levels is unprecedented in the last 1,300 years. Its most alarming result? The rise of the East Greenland ice sheet since the end of the last glacial maximum was twice that of the Greenland ice sheet during the mid-20th century and nearly three times that of the ice sheet during the early 20 th century.

This "East Greenland Glacial Isostatic Adjustment" is causing sea levels by about 1 millimeter a year. The East Greenland Ice Shelf, a massive sheet of ice that extends about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Greenland and about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Canada, holds enough water to raise sea levels by about 1.4 millimeters a year.

In response to the rapid pace of East Greenland Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, scientists have already begun to study methods to mitigate its effects. They have focused on building ice shelves – floating masses of ice that float above the ocean – in areas where Greenland ice is melting, but are also developing techniques for making smaller changes on a regional scale.

For example, scientists are investigating ways to remove more water from the Greenland ice sheet, by pumping water directly into the ocean and thus accelerating glacial retreat. Such plans would not only affect the ice sheets as a whole, but would also accelerate coastal shoreline erosion, according to researchers.

"The East Greenland Glacial Isostatic Adjustment is causing sea levels by about 1 millimeter a year. The East Greenland Ice Shelf, a massive sheet of ice that extends about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Greenland and about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Canada, holds enough water to raise sea levels by about 1.4 millimeters a year" says study researcher David Pollard of the University of Minnesota.

Pollard and his colleagues used the latest in satellite-based measurements of sea levels to track the progression of the East Greenland ice sheet's retreat from 1961 to 1990.

They then looked at sea levels since the late 1990s, with the full extent of East Greenland ice sheet still unconfirmed and the Greenland ice sheet currently losing 300 cubic kilometers of water a year.

"The last time we saw sea level change in this amount was around 9,000 years ago," Pollard says.

From 1981 to 1990, when the East Greenland Ice Sheet went into collapse, global ocean levels dropped between about 0.1 and 0.4 millimeters (0.06-0.25 inches). But after that, global sea levels went up between 1.7 for the early 20th century to more than 3 meters (10 feet) higher by the early 21st century.

The researchers say their results are "completely unexpected and, although still in the early stages of scientific investigation, provide a basis for future work on sea level response to human activity"

To be clear, this is still a huge amount of water, about 300 cubic kilometers more than global waters took as ice melt from the entire Greenland ice sheet in the 1980s and 1990s combined – and enough for a significant number of flooding events around the world. For example, the Gulf of Mexico flooded last July and August by up to 4 meters (13 feet) when sea levels rose as much as a meter (3 feet) due to record-breaking melting in the Arctic. The U.S. Southeast was also ravaged by flooding last summer when temperatures rose up to 23 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit (11 to 22 degrees Celsius).

A member of the group with the same name who used to go by the pseudonym "Nina" had been hiding under the alias of "Tae" for more than a year. She told The Korea Herald that she decided to reveal her true name after she learned that Katsuhiro was the group's original singer.

Kumamoto started recording for the album JAM Project: The Final Album in late September and released her first single with the band, "Trial" on November 1.

JAM Project is the first of its kind in J-pop music history, with artists including CLAP, 2AM, 4Minute, and J.Y. Park making a name for themselves under the group, which also includes several members of groups such as 4NO and EXO.

CNN: "Donald Trump is not making this up, right?"

The Hill: "His tweet that 'dummy' Ted Cruz is running a 'disaster' for the GOP simply isn't true."

Huffington Post: "For Trump to say the RNC should have chosen someone other than Kasich was, well, an epic display of bad sportsmanship."

MSNBC: "It is unclear what his problem is with Ted Cruz."

NPR: "Donald Trump's Twitter spat with Ted Cruz over the RNC chairmanship has everyone wondering why the GOP presidential nominee's Twitter habits aren't on the front burner."

Fox News: "A new, more comprehensive CBS News poll shows Ted Cruz is surging against his one-time rival Donald Trump. The poll found that Cruz received 24 percent of the vote to 21 percent for Trump, with John Kasich drawing 7 percent."


The Times of India: "With the presidential race in its final day, Donald Trump has launched an angry war of words with another of his GOP rivals - Texas Governor Ted Cruz.

The Republican front-runner has been tweeting messages such as: 'If @POTUS picks Cruz as his VP, that would be a massive disaster for the Republican Party.'

His opponent Sen. Ted Cruz is also the subject of tweets from Republican rivals such as Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who have been retweeting the Texas governor."

The Washington Post has an interesting graphic of how Trump has been using Twitter to campaign. He spent about 4 minutes a day on Twitter before his Saturday outburst to tweet out:

.@SenTedCruz, funny looking face, speaks badly of me (don't like him) and his wife. Maybe he was used by Bush. Does not look presidential! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2015

It's worth noting that Trump uses a Twitter account that's been inactive since December 2014, so there's every chance he hasn't actually deleted any of his tweets because it's hard to do that with Twitter's "archive" feature.

If his personal Twitter account shows only 6 tweets, while his campaign account shows 15, and his campaign account also shows that 4 of those 15 were deleted, how does that work? And why has he deleted all 15, but not 6 of them?<|endoftext|>The last of the nine children of a Polish nobleman, the great Count Peter von Straczynski built his fortune in financial services and real estate, but mostly in hotels and casinos.

A lot has been said and written about the current political situation in the United States. There are countless articles and podcasts about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or the various politicians vying to take their side. There is also a multitude of videos created by individuals that seem to focus more on the current political cycle than any of the problems that the country faces.

One of the videos that has stood out is a recent compilation video of all of the top 25 Most Influential People in the World that is produced entirely by an Italian, Italian-American and European person who is living in the United States.

We have to be honest, most of the top 25 people in the world are Italian – and the majority of them are not politically active. In fact, most Italians do not even identify as U.S.-born.

A list of the top 25 most influential people in the world has not been taken lightly. It is not a list that people will accept and consider. We live in a democracy. It was created by a person who grew up in France and is now studying Italian at the University of Michigan, but she admits that she "could not understand the point of voting."

The video has been viewed by over 100,000 people from around the world, and it has been featured prominently on The New York Times and CNN.

Pablo Zabaleta is keen to sign for Manchester City, according to his agent.

The Argentine defender is out of contract in the summer and has indicated his desire to leave Real Madrid.

But Spanish newspaper Marca have reported that Zabaleta's agent, Eduardo Gonzalez, is confident the defender will end up in Manchester, and has warned his client is "open to every offer".

Zabaleta's representatives met City's chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and chief executive Ferran Soriano, and are reportedly seeking a £10m fee.

"We discussed many things, but there was no agreement," Gonzalez told Marca, adding: "We will wait until Manchester City has made its decision to accept his bid."

Gonzalez had also called for Zabaleta to be given a chance to prove himself at City, and is said to be hopeful that the club's coaching staff will back their player.

The 33-year-old joined City from Arsenal at the start of the season in a deal believed to be worth £9m plus added factors.

Zabaleta has made only 14 Premier League appearances for City since making his debut in August 2012.

He has failed to pick up a booking in that time and has found it difficult to assert himself at the heart of the backline.

At 34 years of age, Zabaleta still has years of international football left in him, and many would look to see him in the squad for the 2013 Brazil World Cup in the middle of next year.<|endoftext|>After a little break, I feel the need to finish up a series that I began earlier this year. This is to be a monthly series where I'll show you what goes into creating and editing a short anime. I'm looking to get a few other people involved to help with the editing and to help take an introspective look, both on the quality of the animation and the story. So, without further delay, lets get started!

The Animation

This week I'm going to show you both the animation process itself and the results. The first video I'll be showing you is something that I call "Sci-fi vs. Fantasy", the animation for this short anime starts with a pre-visualisation of the storyboards and storyboarding process. I will explain what I know and will only use the animation of this scene as a reference with the rest of it being created in-house.

When I first started looking at animation in 2008, I knew very little about the techniques involved in animation. I'd taken a few classes in school on basic animation so as to give me a better understanding of what I was looking at and I had a rudimentary understanding of keyframe animation, but this was enough to get the job done. However, if I ever thought of doing a short anime in future, I would definitely look into understanding some of the other more advanced areas of animation.

The same goes for the characters as I would need to have enough knowledge to not have too many errors or wrong decisions when I would be drawing the character. I have seen a few artists who don't know how they draw certain kinds of figures, and as a result of

Downtown St. Paul celebrated the arrival of its last streetcar in May. But what does the future hold once the final tracks are pulled out of the ground?

When the city announced the end of streetcars in May of last year, the inevitable questions soon followed: What do we do with those last cars that roll by, along with the final trains?

What will become of the vacant downtown streetcar tracks? Will the city be able to use them? Is the city willing to demolish the cars?

In a joint interview with the St. Paul Pioneer Press, officials from the city, the state Department of Public Works and the University of Minnesota said that many of those questions have already been answered. They did not, however, give an update on the plans for the streetcars or how much it would cost to keep their service alive.

A $250,000 contract awarded to Minnesota-based St. Paul-based KSTP in January could end up saving the city money over the long run, city officials say.

"We've done a great job of building up a new fleet," Mayor Chris Coleman told the newspaper.

It's estimated that the new streetcar system could save the city as much as $200,000 annually in maintenance by using new-generation electric vehicles instead of traditional steam-powered ones. The streetcar system has also been an economic boon for the city, bringing in nearly three-quarters of a million dollars in revenue during its inaugural year last year with a five-year revenue record of $34.4 million, according to city budget projections for 2016.

"In many ways, KSTP has been the catalyst for all that," said Rob D'Ambrosio, vice president for finance and administration at the city.

The city will pay $40 million for KSTP's five-year contract, which includes three years of revenue and five years of maintenance, Dambrosio said, adding that construction is set to begin early next year on the KSTP tracks.

The track will be built within the vacant lots east of the city's RiverCentre parking garage.

The streetcar line was originally meant to run from the downtown riverfront to the RiverCentre, but St. Paul officials opted to terminate its streetcar service earlier this year, citing the high cost and the poor condition of the tracks.

The tracks were supposed to be torn up by 2014 but were delayed by St. Paul's decision to build a new light-rail station at the University of Minnesota.

"Now that everything is behind us that originally drew people here, it will be about getting the new track laid down and the signal system built up," D'Ambrosio said.

A $10 million federal grant that was awarded to St. Paul in June will allow KSTP to continue improving the stations at University of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, while continuing to remove the tracks, in an effort to get them ready before the light rail stops open, a St. Paul city official said.

KSTP will get the $10 million through a project that was started under former Mayor R.T. Rybak, who took over as mayor last year and had proposed putting in a streetcar to connect downtown with Hennepin County. But the project never went anywhere, with the city choosing instead to run buses along the streetcar line for the first year, instead of the new electric cars.

The city, county and other organizations are also still working to move the light-rail rail line forward, but a light rail line along Nicollet Avenue and Nicollet Mall is expected to open late next year.<|endoftext|>Still loading...

======================================== SAMPLE 175 ========================================
I'm back again and I'm bringing with me today's freebie – all of our weekly polls!

The final week of our month-long survey is here! As always, we are asking to make your pick for the top free agent on the market. The big prize this time around is a new three year, $54MM extension for A.J. Burnett.

For those of you not familiar with the "FIP versus ERA" scale, FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) attempts to quantify how well a pitcher has pitched and ERA (earned run average) is the amount of runs a pitcher would have allowed had their innings not been stopped for an injury. We've all had "rough" weeks, whether that be having a week where your pitching runs hot or your ERA and FIP line up perfectly like in a perfect game. However, while neither are perfect metrics, they do provide a sense of how close a pitcher's performance was to his underlying average to get a sense of "how good" they were, the ultimate measure of "luck."

The first time I ran this survey, I asked "If your team had the option to keep your ERA over 100 but you didn't keep your FIP at or under 100, which one would you prefer?" This week, we are adding a "C.I.P. over 100 vs. FIP" option so people can get an idea of what the real difference is between the two, and the results are fascinating! The C.I.P. over 100 team has only 2 wins in 6 attempts.

It looks like there is actually something to contend with over the next couple of weeks.

Now for my personal favorite option out of all of the options. FIP + ERA doesn't factor in the catcher's defensive plays, like we've often seen in the past, it also doesn't factor in defense played by the pitchers themselves or when the pitcher has started to get out of control, so it's not a perfect measure, but it's still a damn good barometer.

It would appear that A.J. Burnett was the best pitcher this past week, or at least he did come closest. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Josh Johnson, Justin Verlander, Chris Sale, and David Price. In the AL East, the only pitcher with a FIP under 100 who is actually getting a lot of "luck" was James Shields, albeit with a low number of starts.

The Rays are in a battle for first, but they're still in a very good position. The Blue Jays are starting to find their footing and have a bit of a rotation lock in their favor, as they hold a strong hold on one of the division's best arms in Marcus Stroman who, with his FIP under 100, was also the best pitcher this past week!

This is the longest winning streak since 2003, as both the Orioles and Rays are tied for the top spot. The Blue Jays seem to be doing very well. They have won 4 of their last 5 games, which is tied for 2nd among all teams in the division. Even the bad news for them is that they've won 8 of their last 9 games, which is the 2nd-best win/loss streak in all of baseball.

The Orioles are 4 games up in the AL East heading into play on Monday. They currently have the lowest runs allowed in the AL this season at 2.84, after only allowing 2.88 last year. That number, of course, is still extremely low, so the Orioles are still in an extremely good position, but we've also seen the team not be a great bullpen in the past, as the 4.45 ERA they're currently sporting could be much worse. Even if the O's did keep a good bullpen together, they are still the 2nd worst reliever-by-opponent ERA in the division.

The Angels are in a battle for second, but they are now sitting at 5 games out of the first Wild Card spot. This is something the Angels have struggled with all season, something to watch for with their current 5-7 record. They are currently sitting at 5th in FIP/FIP, but also the only team in the division that has no team ERA over 5.1. Their 6th-lowest ERA is an uninspiring 4.69, but they lead the league in runs per game by a wide margin, so they may not be quite as bad as they appear.

The Mariners have a .524 SLG, and have 4.6 runs more per game than the Mariners' opponents, but have an ERA of 4.61. They also lead the division in team BABIP (.327), and when the team plays its best ball, they do very well, but with an average of 2.92 in the last 4 days, it's pretty apparent the Mariners are not very good.

The Brewers have won 4

The following article is entirely the opinion of Zachary Fardon and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr.

I hate to be the one to spoil it for you, but it sounds like this may be the moment you finally have to admit that you don't really buy Hillary's excuse for the Benghazi attacks.

"I stand corrected," she said at a Sunday fundraiser when someone suggested they might have been a terrorist attack. "The attack in Libya that killed four Americans was a planned attack, not an spontaneous response to some video."

But that's just not true. A detailed investigation by Fox News found that the attack "appears to have been planned for months in advance." It was launched by a group calling itself Ansar Al Sharia, which has ties to Al Qaeda in Egypt.

"We believe in Allah Akbar" and "There is no deity but Allah … We have no desire to harm America or any other country, except in defense of Islam, and we aim to defend it."

Now this isn't the first time Hillary has made a mistake. She was caught out lying over her emails in April of last year, a month before the official campaign launch.

But what she said two months ago (and what she said again at the fundraiser last night) are far more damning than anything you can claim that could possibly be a mistake.

In 2014, Clinton spoke at a fundraiser hosted by Terry McAuliffe, who served as governor of Virginia between 2010 and 2014. McAuliffe was the key person in the state who was charged with running Obama's reelection campaign in 2013. Before that, McAuliffe was the Democratic National Committee chair. He served as a fundraiser for Clinton's 2008 bid as well.

Here are the excerpts from Terry McAuliffe's speech, just in case he didn't realize these words were being used against him in the years to come.

The United States is more divided than it was eight years ago. This campaign is the first in the modern era in which the entire country gets a fair look at the president and all he is worth… This is a historic election. And I would ask everyone listening tonight, please go out and help your local candidates…I'm just the messenger…

That's not the only time Clinton talked about her ability to bring the country together after the terrible events at the United States diplomatic annex in Benghazi.

"Let's remember why the attacks on 9/11 happened," Clinton said at an April rally. "The terrorists were already on our soil before the embassy in Cairo, before the embassy in Benghazi, before the consulate in Benghazi."

What Clinton failed to mention is that at least three terrorist attacks took place in Egypt on September 11, 2012 in which Americans were killed and several were injured—and that the State Dept. sent out a cable the very next day warning Americans to be watchful because those attacks had been planned before the embassy attack in Libya began.

In addition, it's important to note that during the attacks, Egypt's ambassador had his embassy attacked by a rocket-propelled grenade, yet not a single government official at the Pentagon sent a cable warning Americans of security threats.

After those attacks occurred, Clinton went on the tell people in America all about how "we" had to get along like Americans.

"I know our enemies know how we feel," Clinton said. "And if we act together, if we work together, if we are prepared to stand up to the terrorists, I firmly believe that we can defeat them."

This is a lie. The only reason terrorists targeted Benghazi was because of the American military helping defend Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The terrorists attacked Libya because of the American military helping to protect the dictator.

So in closing, I don't know how the Democrats would justify the attack on Benghazi, but they don't. Not by a long shot. Their attempt to justify their horrible crime by arguing that the people who died were innocent Americans is an insult to America.

The study also details the efforts undertaken both by international organizations and government to combat human trafficking in Nepal.

Nepal is the fourth largest landlocked country in the world; the people number one-fifth of the country's population. While its economy can be dominated by agricultural products such as rice, it also relies on fishing and tourism. Nepal's largest industry, however, is its tourism industry, which generates an annual tourism income exceeding $13 billion.

The country's tourism industry accounts for 15-16 percent of Nepal's GDP and employs around one-fifth of the workers in the economy. In 2006, Nepal had a tourist expenditure of $842 million.

If that doesn't make you want to sit down and play 30 Years Of Space.

In the game, you have to try to predict the future using a system of cubes. Some cubes indicate positive signals, like the moon, while other cubes indicate negative signals like an asteroid. If you correctly guess what the future will be, you get points. If you make lots of mistakes, you fail.

So, what, exactly, could Material Design bring to Google Now Launcher? The first major change for Now Launcher in Android L will be to break out and break down the notification cards into a single page.

In previous versions of Google Now Launcher, the cards are split up like this:

Now with Material Design, cards will break down like this:

As you can see, the cards are split into three main sections, including three sections for text, phone numbers and more. And in each of the three sections, there's plenty of room for the Google logo, so the space is pretty limited on the new Google Now Launcher screens.

This will also help ensure your information isn't scattered across the front of the screen.

This will also help ensure your information isn't scattered across the front of the screen. In all honesty, I can see Google Now Launcher losing a lot on the new design because it's really hard to keep all of the information in one area of the screen. So the design is better at making sense, but that will also come with a loss of functionality. After all, you can't hide Google Now Cards — only the search bar can hide them.

And while the design is improved, Google has been kind enough to give us some hints and tips for when we're ready to try out all the new changes on our personal Google Now Launcher.

First, there's a "Lollipop New" badge for Now Launcher, which means that you can update Google Now Launcher to the new version that supports the changes made in Android L starting on March 12, 2015.

Second, the new icons for Now Launcher are now rounded, since the Android L launcher has the ability to round Android objects.

And last, the new app drawer and tab layout should be easier to work with now that there's less clutter.

If you are on a leave of absence (for example, taking leave for pregnancy, long-term ill health or to visit your family or to attend a university), then the length of your leave will be considered and your leave can start as soon as you start the leave.

Understand a time-and-a-half entitlement

You are entitled to take an average of an average of 40 hours or more per week (or some hours more) in pay, leave and other benefits (e.g. pensions and overtime) for every two weeks you are employed.

How does it work?

An average is calculated as a combined amount of hours worked at different hourly rates, and does not take into account the time you spend travelling or waiting.

The calculation includes any time you take off for reasons other than work. So a worker who would typically work one day for 11 hours, and does the same job every day for the time between, will get an average of 38 hours a week.

The law also says a person does not incur a time-and-a-half penalty for work done on public holidays. If you work a 7.45am to 5.15pm shift, then you are entitled to an average of 48 hours

The U.S. and the E.U. will soon embark on a major plan to overhaul the financial system, aiming to "drastically" speed up the delivery of central bank liquidity. The effort to achieve this will largely be a reworking of E.U. rules.

The announcement on Monday of the "European Liquidity Regulation Initiative," and the accompanying timetable for the creation of a European Liquidity Agency, will take center stage this month as the E.U. heads into an important summit for financial-market reforms.

The plan to modernize the E.U.'s approach to liquidation—aside from setting up a new bank resolution authority, called the E.U. resolution financing provider, or E.U.S.F.P.—comes on the heels of the European Central Bank's decision in June to create a pan-European fund to support banks. And the E.U. is no stranger to financial crises. In 2010, it set up a "bail-in" tool—named "bail-in," after the original German Bailiffs' Office—to ensure that financial firms were liquid enough to survive. But despite the complexity and size of these and other financial-market efforts—and the fact that they were conceived in an era when Europe's financial sectors were still thriving—they have largely failed because they rely on the same old approaches, and fail to address the need for effective oversight and regulation.

Most crucially, both the E.U. and the E.U.S.F.P will rely on rules written well before the 2008 crisis. These include rules governing when and how banks can be closed (i.e., allowed to fail), where and how depositors can take their money and transfer it to another bank, and a rule known as the "living will" for insolvent companies, which will help determine how much a company has to pay to creditors and how many jobs can be cut.

Yet these rules have to date played a significant role in helping to prevent crises like the 2008 financial meltdown and other recent shocks.

When banks fail in Europe, depositors typically lose their primary right to have money put into the bank and, instead, become creditors. A bank's creditors can be companies (including pension funds), governments, or other kinds of institutions. After a bank receives a bail-in order, it is unable to use funds such as depositors' funds to pay back its creditors. This usually means that the institution would be forced to declare bankruptcy and either pay its clients' cash out to them or liquidate or close down—something the systemically important institution might never contemplate in today's environment. In such circumstances and with a dead bank, the rest of the credit market is shut down.

The banking reform proposal set up by the E.U. and the E.U.S.F.P will use the living-will rules to make it far harder for the systemically important to fail. Essentially, in the E.U. they will become a way for regulators to force the largest banks to hand over more of their depositors' funds. If banks get caught with more than a prescribed amount of money, they will be held responsible for paying an additional rate (called a "haircut") at the point of liquidation.

By contrast, the U.S.F.P. won't do that. Instead, it will place rules for how to make the biggest banks liquid. That will mean, essentially, that banks whose big risks are concentrated in the areas that could take the largest hits will be the ones hit with the higher haircuts. While it's not clear how exactly those risk areas will be defined, regulators would at least like to ensure they take place within certain boundaries—and that the haircuts will correspond with the banks' credit risk.

As for supervision, it too will fall to regulators in the E.U. and the E.U.S.F.P. to help. The E.U. and E.U.S.F.P. will set and enforce a series of "stress tests" that will evaluate the systemically risky banks.

These tests would aim to identify the banks most likely to suffer severe stress. By combining the E.U. rules—and the E.U.'s bank resolution authority, the E.U.S.F.P.—with the E.U.'s living will rules, it is likely that regulators in the U.S. and the E.U. would be able to prevent banks like Deutsche Bank or Bank of America, and possibly even U.S. insurers, from going bust.

Ultimately, though, these two approaches would be very different. One will use the E.U.'s rules and regulations to ensure that the big systemically important banks are very good at running, in the jargon of banking-sector executives, as "systemically stressed." The other approach

When I was in school, my parents wanted me to go into advertising. However, if it was a career at all, I wanted to be a film editor. I didn't realise that I was gay until I was about 27, and that I was so much more interested in working on film and TV than in advertising – for which I would never have found a place as a film editor. At the time I didn't have any gay role models, so it was something that I was pretty reluctant to pursue until I found myself in a situation where I was asked to do advertising, which I took to very seriously.


But in 2011 it was becoming increasingly clear to me that there was a growing divide between the advertising and the films and TV I loved. And I started to think, 'Maybe I shouldn't be so reluctant to approach the film industry now. If I was going to start a film company, I should be a film editor, because that's my natural focus.' But when I was talking to my agent about starting a film company, he was very hesitant to sign me.


So I started writing a pitch and I emailed it to several agents, because, you know, I didn't want to ask the wrong agents. I ended up writing the pitch to just one, and it was rejected. When I wrote the pitch to another agency, they were very open to it – the second one I wrote was rejected as well, which kind of knocked me. But I'd done something wrong, so I went back and I wrote that one again, and it was accepted.


I'd had a few other rejections before that, but the first one, and that final one were the biggest. So I went to the agency and I said to them, 'If I know you're not going to hire me, and you know I'm not going to accept your rejection, then maybe I'm better off starting my own company.'


I remember having a good lunch with my agent and my family and trying to convince them of that. My father in particular thought it was a bad idea. He thought I was putting my life on the line to go outside of my comfort zone. My dad did not have a very welcoming view of the gay community, so there was definitely that resistance.


Then, when I went to Cannes to meet my agent, it turned out that he was a gay man so he was supportive. I was very relieved. I remember thinking, 'Thank God, my career is going to have a better chance than mine has'.


I guess in that respect there is still this huge gap between the straight mainstream and even the mainstream LGBT community. Which is good! I think the mainstream industry does have a duty of care and it should be able to look at films and TV shows and know that there are people like me and other young people that just want to be creative.


I think there is just this idea that there is no room out there, that we are just this weird minority who have to go into hiding to be ourselves. So for it to be taken seriously as part of the industry – and certainly I feel that it is – is a huge achievement and a great sign of change. I would definitely say that that's the right attitude to take towards the gay community.


As a young girl growing up in Britain and in Britain around the world, I thought about how you might be different from other LGBT kids, and what you could have brought to the table.


I think that young people in general need role models – in particular I'm thinking of things like Pride – to show them that you can be who you really are and still be successful and get on in the world. As an actor, that's the stuff I wanted to talk about most, because I wanted to show kids who were not like me that you could do that. That you could be successful and still be yourself.


As a child I didn't have any gay role models, and I used to read about it in the paper. I found the way that gay people were portrayed on screen to be so inaccurate. At one point when I was about seven or eight years old, I had the chance to meet Hugh Grant in West End. I was very much enjoying himself and talking to Hugh and I was chatting to Michael Sheen, and on stage I looked over to the side, and there was a group of kids who were playing 'Carnival' with no adults, and I thought, "Wow, that's great. That's a real life moment."

It was only when I was 12 years old I was allowed to watch The Phantom of the Opera, so I was lucky enough to see the first gay kiss on film. And I was really surprised by the way in which it was done in the film. Then, when I was 14, I discovered the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show.


I have always felt that the way that it was done on film was a fantastic example of showing how a

We have all experienced that feeling of being overwhelmed by our work, or overwhelmed with the amount of work we have to do. Whether it is our family or our career, it can make us feel as though there wasn't enough to do. However, the answer is actually quite simple: there is always more work to do. When it comes to managing, or just setting realistic priorities of your time, the difference between "too busy" and "not busy enough'' can be the difference between having adequate time to spend with your family and having excessive work.

As the saying goes, "If you don't have enough time on your hands, how can you give your family enough time?"

This is especially relevant since work is something you may not necessarily want to be doing all the time. It gives extra work-life balance when you find yourself not feeling comfortable that you have enough time to spend with your family, for instance.

In order to have a more balanced work and family life, it is important to recognize all the responsibilities you have in your life and all the time you need to spend on these.

One of the most overlooked responsibilities is caring for each other. Even during the busy holiday season, you need to find time to care for your loved ones. Not only is it important to take care of yourself when you have work and family, but having time to take care of others also helps ensure that you both can have a solid family system in place, and that you feel more connected and bonded to your family.

When you're running out of time to spend with your family, you'll have to be creative or you may just have to give up. And it might seem like giving up may be the only solution. But don't do it.

If there is no time for you to take care of others, what is there for others to take care of you? If your spouse is stressed out and can't get much work done, if your children are sick or emotionally exhausted because of the work load, if your boss is upset that you are spending too much time at work, who are you going to turn to for help? What would you do without that kind of support?

One of the most important lessons I've learned over the past few years is that even if there is a time in your life that is busy with work, you could still use some time to take care of ones and others. The key is to know which responsibilities are most important to you and find a way to make it happen.<|endoftext|>From the moment Mr. Obama took office, Republicans have demanded that he use his powers to undo the actions of Mr. Bush. They have said that unless the Bush administration acknowledged mistakes in the way it handled its wartime policy, a precedent would be set that could allow future presidents to sweep the rest of their decisions away. The administration has balked at that demand, saying there is nothing that can be undone by executive order, and that Mr. Obama and his team are trying to use the judicial process to avoid overreach.

A judge, Leonie M. Brinkema, in Virginia, last month ruled that a provision requiring the National Guard to help carry out the invasion of Iraq was unconstitutional. Mr. Obama appealed her ruling to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday delayed all legal motions until after the election — but the political furor over the case has not slowed the White House's efforts.

Mr. Obama has also ordered the declassification of the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate predicting that Iraq had an imminent stockpile of weapons, which is closely linked to the case of Abu Ghanima, a Jordanian, who was seized by American troops after allegedly setting his house on fire and shouting that he had weapons of mass destruction. In order to avoid the impression that the Administration had a partisan agenda, his aides released his opinion only after Mr. Petraeus gave it the cautious stamp that intelligence analysts say it deserved.

Mr. Obama's campaign aides say the decision reflects what they characterize as his policy of focusing on what is most effective, rather than on what is politically acceptable. At a press conference in Washington, David Axelrod, his campaign manager and a close adviser, said he had no regrets about making the Abu Ghanima decision public so soon after it had been announced and that he had "made no secret" what his own view was.

The president's views are not widely known or fully understood, as his aides made clear in their briefing about them on Wednesday evening, but he has made clear this will be one of the defining issues of his presidency.

In a rare move, Russia has sent a peacekeeping force of more than 3,000 to Crimea, where an armed Ukrainian separatist movement has gained strength. The move follows a request from Ukraine's Kiev regime. At the same time, the Russian Foreign Ministry declared that Russian peacekeepers in Ukraine will "remain a part of the international peacekeeping activities."

In a letter to the United Nations, Ukraine's government in Kiev said that Russian peacekeepers had been allowed to join Ukraine's mission to protect civilians against the conflict in Crimea, "thus effectively taking on the mission that the Russian Federation had previously said it intended to terminate." The Ukrainian government, in its request for peacekeepers, had expressed its wish to send more than 3,500 personnel to protect civilians. The Ukrainian request came a day after President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted in street protests that have since led to Russia's annexation of Crimea.

According to the letter written by Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia, the new peacekeepers were dispatched to Crimea without any preconditions. Kiev said they will guard the Russian military base at Sevastopol as well as Russian citizens stationed at the base and within the peninsula.

Meanwhile, Russia's Foreign Ministry, in a statement, called the actions by Kiev's government "illegal," reiterating its demand that Ukraine's leaders cancel the decision to abandon Crimea and resume negotiations with the West over the country's future. The statement also noted that the Russian Peacekeeping Force will remain in Ukraine "as a part of the international peacekeeping activities."

"With today's announcement, the Ukrainian authorities have broken all the guarantees and agreements they had signed with the Russian Federation," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in its statement.

According to the foreign ministry, the deployment of Russian forces into Ukraine is in response to "the military coup of February 22" in Kiev. The Ukrainian government, the document reads, has now "failed to comply with its international agreement and obligations."

On July 18, Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had declared to the foreign minister of Ukraine that there will only be "military action" in Ukraine and that Russia would respond to any aggression in accordance with its international obligations.

On Tuesday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. The US, UK and Australia are among those countries who have expressed their concerns over the latest development in the Ukrainian crisis.

In his comments to reporters, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki described Russia's deployment into Crimea as a "significant" step for Moscow.

In an interview to Sputnik, US Senator John McCain said that the deployment of foreign troops into Ukraine is "a dangerous step."

"It's important that they stay there. I just don't think sending in troops into Ukraine is going to change their government," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin has been quoted as saying by local media.<|endoftext|>Dana White had a message for the UFC's top welterweight in Georges St. Pierre: You need to go to Mexico.

It is no secret that the American people are divided when it comes to the two major political parties.

However, one particular poll released Tuesday that will leave some political scientists disappointed and others awestruck has suggested that the American public is less divided on how to vote than how to vote for who to vote for in each presidential election, according to CNN.

The poll, conducted by Rasmussen Reports, was conducted in February 2013 and asked 1,000 likely voters whether they would like to sit out the presidential election. The respondents were then asked which candidate they "would most like to see" end up president.

Of the 500 respondents who said that they would like to sit it out, 37 percent said that Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama, while 36 percent would prefer to see Mitt Romney in the Oval Office.

Similarly, 33 percent chose former Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Biden, while 23 percent said Republican candidate former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Only 15 percent of respondents chose former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano to be the next president while 10 percent selected New York Gov. George Pataki.

The poll suggests that if a political figure from either party can manage to become president during a time when the country appears to be more divided along partisan lines, then that candidate's popularity among the voting public is higher than it is for those who have more conservative views on the question.

According to Pew Research Center, in 2008 President George W. Bush was viewed favorably by 42 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 44 percent while in 1996 President Bill Clinton was viewed positively by 52 percent and unfavorably by 48 percent.

According to a June Pew Research poll also released Tuesday that suggested that Republicans have a slight edge when it comes to winning the 2016 Presidential election.

The poll, conducted by the Pew Research Center has found that 46 percent of respondents agreed that Republicans "are generally more interested in listening to everyday Americans and getting things done and giving the power to those who are affected by the decisions we make."

Fifty-eight percent of respondents agreed that Democrats, on the other hand, are "more interested in protecting and expanding their existing power and giving more benefits to a small number of people."

With a Democratic President, Republicans are slightly more likely to look favorably on the party, whereas Democrats have a slight edge over the Republicans when it comes to holding the White House in the next four years, according to the study.<|endoftext|>With the world's eyes fixed on the upcoming World Cup in Brazil, and Brazilians gearing up to take to the fields to cheer their fellow countrymen on, it's easy to forget that soccer is a global game.

That revelation was delivered by the federal official at the pretrial hearing, which continued until yesterday morning, April 5, as part of a motion for protective order that Judge Carlos Samour denied. The motion by the government is to block attorneys for the family of the shooter, James Holmes, from using information provided by David Carroll, the private investigator hired by the family.

The reason is quite clear: Carroll's testimony at the pretrial hearing provided critical information to the Justice Department in the form of notes made as part of a federal search warrant to obtain information from the Internet Service Provider. In a separate case, Carroll testified about the notes he made to the FBI in his police investigation. Carroll will be in the witness box today.

The evidence that Carroll made notes of his conversations with the federal agents in a search warrant application and then passed them on to the Justice Department was critical to the government's case, which was based on a computer he claimed showed the location of the shooting scene, as well as a photograph of the shooting location.

When Carroll's notes were shown during his testimony at the preliminary hearing, Justice Department attorney Andrew Weissman asked Carroll whether he wrote down "whatever information" he had from the online chats he had with agents in Washington. Carroll stated that he did not. But in the pretrial motion filed by the Justice Department, the federal investigator in the case, Robert Feinberg, stated that the notes made it "impossible to know what was true and what was not."

What's at stake?

The House bill will cut $800 million from Medicaid spending. What would the reductions mean?

Medicaid has an annual appropriation of about $100 billion. The House bill plans to use the rest of this money to lower premiums (with a cap on out-of-pocket subsidies), reduce the amount of care Medicaid recipients receive, and limit the amount of inpatient care, especially in rural areas. Medicaid beneficiaries would lose coverage for maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services.


Medicaid has an annual appropriation of about $100 billion. The House bill plans to use the rest of this money to lower premiums (with a cap on out-of-pocket subsidies), reduce the amount of care Medicaid recipients receive, and limit the amount of inpatient care, especially in rural areas. Medicaid beneficiaries would lose coverage for maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services. Medicaid will be replaced with a new program known as the "State Innovation Grants." In short, the House plan to repeal and replace Medicaid would be replacing the program with a state-created fund to finance other things, like health insurance subsidies or expanding state-based high-risk pools.

What are some possible outcomes?

States are still deciding how much money will be available for health care spending. If they use its resources more generously, states could see improvements in Medicaid. But if they use them less aggressively, they could lose money. If states don't make their decisions based on real, not just political, information about a state's Medicaid program, they could end up paying more to poorer Americans in the short term and not getting as much as they could if they had better information.

State decisions about how much to spend on Medicaid are going to be based on the availability of federal financing. If Congress repeals the expansion of the Medicaid program in 2020, states could expect a much smaller amount of federal financing for their Medicaid programs through 2019.

Medicaid is still going to be funded. States will have to cover the costs of newly eligible beneficiaries, just as they have been. If Congress reduces the amount of subsidies that recipients receive, Medicaid will be less affordable for these newly eligible beneficiaries. They may well end up going without coverage or having to pay more for their coverage.

What can the public do?

You can call your member of Congress at 202-224-3121 and ask them to oppose any bills that would repeal and replace the current law.<|endoftext|>We are a family of four, located in the heart of the beautiful New England region with comfortable, yet convenient close-by areas to a variety of places to eat and get some shopping done.

We wanted a simple way to put the results of our research into one simple statement: No, it doesn't matter if you're an "expert" in mathematics, physics or chemistry; all that matters is if you're an expert in science.

That might sound simple, but many people still have a hard time believing it. Even scientists can think "You know what, you're right; I'm too busy to actually do science." We felt that the first time we heard it, by a researcher on The Today Show, it became clear. It became clear that the only way scientists would learn was to start doing real science— and that was good news for the "scientific community." We felt that if the public heard the message, then they would be more inspired to take up the mantle of scientific inquiry. So, we set up a series of interactive videos that make it as easy as one can imagine to learn about science.

If you are still skeptical, we encourage you to watch the videos yourself. If we hear from you, we will keep posting the videos as they reach a critical mass. Then we will post a second blog post in about a month when we have listened to what you were thinking, asked some additional questions and analyzed the data about education, science and the need to keep teaching science in schools. To be honest, it is quite hard to find a scientific answer to all of those questions.

The way we did it was to collect the comments and answers we received from educators, scientists and scientists in science and education, to analyze and to compile the most important issues that we felt should inform teachers across the country, because science is important to educators, too. We were also happy to learn from a wide range of perspectives about how we should present the data we collected and the most effective ways of using such data as a foundation for teaching science.

My name is Mary Lawrence and I am a Professor of Law at University of Virginia Law School. The Committee met today with Drs. Starfield and Lawrence with my co-counsel, David M. Kendall. I am pleased that after my appearance in April I have been invited to appear again at this hearing.

Dr. Lawrence is a Professor of Law at the University of Missouri and the author of several books, including: The U.S. National Security State, The Death of Expertise, Terror and Tyranny: The Rule of Law in an Age of Experts, and, most recently, Freedom in the Republic: Law, Justice, and the Public Good. Dr. Lawrence has also served as a Commissioner on the Advisory Board of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and has been an Adjunct Professor of Law at the University of Chicago's law school.

The court did hold that "the Constitution permits not only laws proscribing discrimination, but also laws recognizing and affirming that discrimination." That might suggest that gay marriage and anti-gay discrimination are inextricably tied, but the justices took pains to point out that the Constitution does not require states to allow gay nuptials, and that those couples who wish to wed should just have to go to court to get their marriages approved by the state. The court's opinion in United States v. Windsor was widely seen as a vindication of marriage and the institution of marriage, but it did not say that marriage, nor gay marriage, required legal recognition from states.

Today, all 50 states have statutes recognizing a marriage from another state that was valid in the state where it was formed, no matter how long or short the time spent in that state. But if you look at the Supreme Court's marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, you've got another piece of that puzzle. On April 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing for the majority, that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry, regardless of their state of residence at the time. In other words, they weren't bound to a state by one of their neighbors' laws unless the federal law trumped state law. How could the court have ruled the other way when states had not made it clear that gay marriage was unlawful while they did not make clear that it was allowed? The answer might be that all states had made it clear to both straight and gay people that same-sex marriage was wrong, but that gay people didn't know that and couldn't understand that states weren't bound by laws that same-sex couples couldn't enforce even though states had made it perfectly clear that they were not.

Even before Obergefell, the Supreme Court had hinted at the idea that the constitution does allow laws to be enforced by other means other than the state in which they were passed. In Windsor v. United States, the court asked "what effect, if any, the Fourteenth Amendment has on marriage, a fundamental right in our society." Justice Kennedy had answered "not much," writing, "As with other rights, it is not for this Court to say that a State will have to pay any more heed to the Fourteenth Amendment's protections than it does to its own."

In other words, Kennedy was acknowledging that the Fourteenth Amendment protects people from having their marriages struck down by the state, but it doesn't prevent the states from recognizing those marriages. The point for the court was not that the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to give marriage rights to same-sex couples, but that states couldn't take away those rights through their laws, which Kennedy called "nothing more than a prohibition on the States' refusal to honor a solemnized marriage that some other State may refuse to recognize."

In a follow up opinion, Chief Justice Roberts added his own insight to the question: in his view the right to marry is protected under the laws of all states.

But the question of whether a person can be gay, lesbian or bisexual in some states but not others is not straightforward. If a state allows for civil unions (with the state recognizing gay and lesbian marriage equally), that marriage cannot be revoked by states, but if it does not, then a

The new update to the iPhone Threat Hunter, which has been downloaded an estimated 25 million times according to analytics website App Annie, is one of the most popular pieces of software Apple released this year. The version number in the app is 2.4, which makes it one of the most recent updates.

The update addresses more than three dozen security vulnerabilities revealed in a recent research note from cybersecurity firm Check Point.

Check Point researchers discovered six serious issues in the latest version of Threat Hunter, which was released ahead of the iPhone 5 launch in September.

The most serious security flaw, dubbed "Impetukin," is caused by a bug that allows the spyware to compromise iPhones running iOS 5 or higher without a way for the user to detect the problem.

"This is a very serious bug," said David Moler, security engineer at Lookout, a provider of security products. He said he didn't know of any other security flaw like the one reported by Check Point, although he did say it's possible for an unscrupulous hacker to exploit the flaw.

For instance, "Impetukin can spy on your calls, SMS messages and emails, see where you are, see when you are at home and when you are out at night," Check Point wrote.

"So what I think people will want to do is they are going to want to take the iOS device out of the safe mode," Mr. Moler said.

He recommends disabling the "Find My iPhone" feature on a locked iPhone and locking the device down with a passcode, something he said any savvy user will follow.

"If you need to, you should be using the Find My iPhone feature to see where it is," Mr. Moler said.

Another major issue is "Tethering," which allows the iPhone to be remotely exploited or accessed because it allows the spyware to track the device when it is outside of its control, such as while on airport or train travel. Another vulnerability, called "NFC," allows the spyware to intercept payments made with the phone.

Another major flaw is "Impetukin," which Check Point said "can hijack phone calls by eavesdropping on the phone number and listening to the conversations inside the phone," causing the phone to constantly ring or send text messages, according to a blog post from Check Point.

"This could allow someone to take control of your phone and possibly intercept or view information. It also can potentially cause you to get a call, text, voicemail, or send you a text or email."

The vulnerability was disclosed by cybersecurity firm Check Point as a "bug report" on its website and was announced by Apple.

"You can find the CVE IDs for those vulnerabilities by going to About Security in Settings and tapping the About vulnerability section," an Apple spokesperson told CNET.

Some versions of iOS are vulnerable while others are not, according to Check Hill. However, the majority of users are on iOS 5. The vulnerability affects a handful of third-party apps that are linked to the iPhone's "Find My iPhone" feature, according to Check Point. The apps were not distributed by Apple.

The flaw and the bugs reported in the latest version of Threat Hunter are only a few of the vulnerabilities that have emerged since the most recent release. In late December, Apple fixed a flaw that was allowing the creation of secret folders on its iOS devices, a problem that allowed people to access sensitive files and files on a user's computer. And last week, Apple released a free tool called iOS Device Health, which gives anyone with Apple's iPhone a real-time alert of the battery condition of their iPhone.

But one thing you probably can't do with any of these flaws is spy on an iPhone without knowing it. Check Point also pointed out that the iPhone is not a computer or a mobile device. In other words, the spyware would not have to be turned on to access your iPhone or make use of apps, as it does on Macs.

"It would be technically possible to create an Android or Blackberry variant of these apps that would take over a Mac, a Blackberry, or a smartphone, but it would not be feasible for them to do so because the phone is not a computer or mobile device," Mr. Moler said.

The group of experts and their lawyers filed an application last week for a preliminary injunction that it fears will prevent a government agency, the Office of Environmental Affairs, from continuing their attempts to censor climate change documents, according to the release.

The lawsuit, filed by the American Tradition Institute, American Forests Foundation, and other organizations, alleges that the state's refusal to release the emails "will significantly interfere with the defendants' and other defendants' efforts to disseminate accurate, independent information about climate change science," "will adversely affect an important scientific discourse, including the efforts to protect and preserve climate research and the efforts of scientists to provide that research in their peer-reviewed research," and "will have a chilling effect on the free flow of scientific knowledge and ideas within the legal community."

The climate of New Hampshire "has already been transformed by greenhouse gases generated through electricity generation and transportation," according to the lawsuit. "For a variety of reasons, the climate has changed over the last century and will continue to change as new sources of greenhouse gases are developed, electricity generation, transportation, and industrialization increase."

The state's climate change policies are "ill-conceived," according to the group's lawsuit, "and have been adopted without sufficient public review, much less a reasoned determination that the changes were required."

New Hampshire recently filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. In its filing the state claims that it can't get its finances in order because they are so heavily burdened by its high debts, as well as the "cost of defending" itself in court.

The state's efforts to combat climate change — which also include legislation that forces businesses that emit greenhouse gases to pay a $50,000 per day tax — have sparked criticism. A report from a New Hampshire court this week confirmed what many have long known: climate change is a real concern and people in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and South Carolina are suffering because of their states' refusal to comply with the rules that the rest of the nation has adopted.<|endoftext|>On January 13, the Department of Justice released an email from Hillary Clinton's legal team concerning a potential lawsuit against the State Department over the security breach of her homebrew server.

The email was in response to a request from Clinton's lawyer.

Clinton's lawyers wanted to avoid a legal battle "in the press, in front of Congress", according to the email.

In the email, Clinton's legal counsel, David Kendall, wrote that "it is possible we can resolve this amicably without the needs of the Department of Justice being involved." Kendall added the department is aware of the situation.

The department refused to comment on its release of the email to Yahoo News, saying the information was considered "highly sensitive." It added that it is standard operating procedure to keep all FOIA responses confidential.

The email is included below.

"The State Department says that the FOIA review would be a 'matter of months' but they will have to give more information on this. There were a series of delays in responding to our FOIA requests and releasing what they have. There were a number of FOIA requests on HRC's server and emails related to them (most of which were not processed)."

On January 13, Kendall was the lawyer representing Clinton at the State Department.

The following day, he sent an email to Clinton's lawyer, Cheryl Mills, with the subject 'Possible FOIA in the Media,'" adding, "please see below. One more update. I had a conversation with Eric Boswell who indicated he was going to give us some sort of response by the end of the day."

On January 15, Boswell forwarded the email to John Bentel, the State Department's spokesman, with the subject, 'Re: Email – Potential FOIA in the Media.'

Boswell wrote: "Eric is working on a statement that is sure to make this less of a problem. It will be released by him tomorrow morning. John and I have discussed it, and we both agree that it would be best for you to not press it in the media. He will have more to say on the same subject."

For the third year in a row, I have been asked what my favourite thing about being a part of The Big Lebowski is. I have given several responses, all of which are variations on 'I can't think of anything else'. Some friends have asked me why I never talk about the movie. Most would say because it is obviously my favourite film. In short: I don't have the capacity to articulate the reasons why being in the movie is superior or why it is worthy of any kind of serious examination. But, if you are a 'true fan' and are looking for a little piece of information about the films and the people involved, this should help.

"Lebowski" is about the relationship between Mr. Lebowski and his high school friends, a group of people who are just as confused as he is. At their core, they have much in common (their teenage sex-craziness, their love for video games, their inability to see eye to eye on a bunch of issues, the need to be able to take care of an older man in their lives). But that's not a bad thing. When you think about it, it's really a fascinating set of relationships.

One of the most notable characters, as the movie progresses, is Wendy (Maureen O'Hara). She becomes his new best friend. She's the one with the most in common with him, the one who knows how to have a simple conversation, a simple meal, whatever can make both of them laugh. And, if you take a closer look at the relationship, you realize that when there is tension, she has to step in and do it. She is the one who can make it all feel more real, who will always pick him up when he's down. This is the same with all of the other characters: they're just as confused as he is, and they need the help of someone, anyone, to make it all go away.

"The Dude" (John Goodman), on the other hand, is the most likeable character for a lot of different reasons. He's the one who is most comfortable with letting go of his life in 'Big Lebowski' terms, the one who can really talk about his problems. Even in that scene in the laundromat, when he says that his best friends are now "my family", all the way through in the final scene, he doesn't seem to care if anyone will hear him (he's the ultimate 'good friend'!).

To a great degree, the film is about Mr. Lebowski's relationship with his own self in 'Big Lebowski' terms. "The Dude" is also someone who feels disconnected from the world. That isn't a bad thing: it also leads to him, through his 'big' adventures in the movie, to a deeper understanding of life. The first time he sees 'The Dude', he sees a familiar kind of 'self', a man with issues, a problem. And so he comes to understand that maybe The Dude is him, the problem that he is trying to solve. And we see that through the final scene where he gets the chance to finally meet The Dude. For the first time, we see The Dude not as an obnoxious drunk, a complete loser for whom there will never be a normal moment in his life, but rather this man, who is trying to understand the world and who is trying, in his own way, to be a good person. The moment when the two are standing together, their eyes meet, the Dude says something like "You're not the one who's trying to make it better. You're the one who was sent to make things better", that's that connection that the movie is all about.

This is the reason why if you ask me to go into "The Dude" as a person, I would rather go in with that statement entirely in mind. I could probably just come out and say that "The Dude" is a man who has a problem with his own humanity, that sometimes he has the urge to be like Mr. Lebowski, to be "that man", but it doesn't really add a lot to what the movie has to say. A movie can certainly tell you what a man should be like, but sometimes you have to think of a person on their own merits. You must not always look for a quick and easy explanation for anything. As The Dude says, it's "funny when he gets it right, but he has a hard time getting it off his chest." There's a scene where he has this 'awkward moment', trying to tell his wife, and she just doesn't grasp what he's talking about - she's always thought that she could understand him.

But then The Dude also has a hard time getting the right thing across, in his own way, through his language. "Funny how they got the whole 'I'm going to live my lifestyle like a

This is the second half of a two-part series. Read about Part 1 and find out about how we decided to use a little black magic called "random guessing" to help choose our "most desirable" female model.

For the first half of the series, I talked about how we decided on our favorite girl and some of the criteria we used for the final selection. This time, I want to talk about the results! The results of your votes have been added to this article. Please read on…

In the end, the only thing we could come to the conclusion was that there was no way we could please EVERYONE. We could just as well have picked something totally random and agreed upon by the entire staff, but that is only a little better than us being wrong the whole time. In many cases, there was really only one winner and that was our little girl. That being said, we decided on this one girl for a few major reasons. First of all, she's the oldest of the three of us, which makes her more mature. Second, I'm a big fan of her personality. Third, she looks kind of like…

You know what I'm going to say, right? I just… It's pretty much like this picture.

Now that I'm done speaking, here is how our three girl chose to pick their three favorites.


1. The girl who looked the best in pictures

2. The guy who looks the coolest

3. The guy whose voice reminded them of someone they know


But we all admit… our favorite is obviously our little chick, so I guess I will get to her then. That's right, she is back. In case you're not interested in her in a photo, that is totally OK! Also, you're not my mother, so make of that what you wish.

Well, since we all know what you're all thinking… what does your favorite one look like? Well, that is where our magical "random guessing" comes in. Let's get started!

So let's start from the front of the stage!

The first question: "Which one do you like the most?"

Well, we had the first choice. Well, at last count, we had 6 girls and as you can see, the vast majority of you voted for our tiny, but oh so pretty little angel. The only girl we had to get right is the adorable lady at the bottom of this post.

From top to bottom:

The one above my Mom. I loved when we decided that we would make sure none of the girls had a boyfriend, because we figured that would allow us to get a better idea of what kind of guys each of them was into.

The guy who looks like the president of the United States. I have to say, when I first saw him, I thought "D'oh! This one's going to take the whole staff to pick." But once we got all of the votes in, I realized he really is the best one.

My favorite girl for the whole staff in a photo, by a landslide. Also, we all know my favorite because I have been showing people this photo and everyone asks me for my favorite one.

The one my mom's boyfriend gave her. I honestly think that the best part of this picture is the look on her face that says "Please, not this dude."

My personal favorite of the three. I guess I have to put the one closest to me because she looks more like me than any of the other three. She can do both a sexy one like this or one I would put my finger on, like this.

Our friend in the middle, a sexy little thing. I have to say, the only thing she has better than her mother is her girlfriend's girlfriends. At least that's how I picture it.

And finally, our favorite. We are all pretty sure these three would make the perfect girlfriend.

Now that we've gotten the rest of the staff to sign some permission slips and put on their favorite pose, let's move inside…


As I mentioned before, the staff was all pretty much unanimous in their pick.

In the front row:

A lovely blonde girl that looks like an Erika Larsen-like person

A tall, sexy brunette with this one shot

A small Asian girl that looks a little like a girl but has legs like mine

And finally, another blond girl who looks like her in my mom's picture…

At the back of the stage:

A girl who looks like her in a photo so her mom could look pretty good when she gets caught

Now that I know all the staff is there, I'll give you a sneak peak at some possible poses they might have in mind for our 3 newest girls.

Let's see if anyone notices anything.



======================================== SAMPLE 190 ========================================
In the last six months, the world has been thrown into the unprecedented debate about the possibility of a global financial meltdown. A lot is at stake, and we need to know what it all means.

To explain, I've put together a list of the key questions — some serious, some trivial — to be answered when we're faced with such a situation:

Is this a bubble or not? How big is the bubble? Are we approaching a systemic failure in the global economy? What are the long-term systemic risks posed by this crisis? Is this the beginning of something big in the world economy, or has it already reached a breaking point?

To answer these questions, it's helpful to recognize some of the core problems of financial markets — both in their ability to respond to short-term pressures and in their ability to provide a fair, stable and predictable environment for the long term of investments, loans and contracts.

In the context of a financial crisis, a real crisis

It is important to acknowledge that no single event or phenomenon is responsible for the rise of the financial sector. Rather, its role is to act as a facilitator for short-term, financialized impulses through the creation of artificial scarcity and through a system of trust between creditors and debtors at the same time.

In so doing, it creates the illusion that we are living in a world where we can rely on trust to ensure the future will be better than our forebears were able to predict in the very first place. (Of course, there is often a lack of trust in the future — or at least an absence of trust — but that's an issue that can be left for another day.)

Moreover, as the recent economic crisis in the US has shown, financial intermediation and bubble financing — the latter based on the creation and then collapse of the real estate sector — can create systemic risk and instability as we've seen in recent financial crises in Ireland, Spain, Ireland, Australia and the US.

The key to understanding the nature of a financial crash is to understand that it's a real event that can be prevented, not prevented by "market logic" or "capitalism." It can and has been triggered by factors such as a mis-priced asset, market manipulation or outright fraud, but it is not a natural event, and there are no inevitable or universal laws that govern this process.

This has many implications for the debate on whether the current financial crisis could be the beginning of something big as a broader financial meltdown, or whether it constitutes no systemic risk.

The financial crash at the turn of the millennium was triggered, with significant systemic implications, when a group of Chinese investors went on a credit binge during the 2000s, which, among other things, precipitated a fall in the exchange rate between China and the US dollar resulting in a dramatic increase in the value of the US dollar.

This was not a result of a market-generated price correction or market manipulation. Instead the problem was a fundamental change with respect to the nature of Chinese credit. For many Western institutions involved in the real-estate market at the time, this is the exact "systemic" risk that they warned of.

That China has since stopped the credit bubble is also a "normal" event, but it was not a market-driven "market correction." Chinese banks did not act as intermediaries and instead became a full-scale issuer of credit; however, these were ultimately backed by China's currency and China's banks were not themselves the financial institutions involved in the credit bubble.

In our view, this type of financialization in itself is not the primary risk that we need to worry about; rather it is the risk that such an event is allowed to go unanswered, which results in unintended consequences: rising credit and asset prices; financial instability in the world economy; and the end of financial market confidence, due to lack of trust.

A systemic failure at the beginning of a crisis

While the events of 2008 were indeed a "system" failure, it had different origins.

One of the primary lessons that should be learned from it for future financial crises and their potential systemic effects is that financial crises don't merely happen randomly; they need to be anticipated.

In other words, we have to anticipate the next crisis so that we can act if it does occur. That way, our response does not become counterproductive or worse.

In my view, an additional danger for the current crisis is that it may have been an internal financial crisis — that is, a crisis in or leading to the financial markets.

When the financial crisis of 2008 broke, it affected different institutions in different areas of the financial system. And for many of them, the event created systemic risks as well as issues in their own operations.

For example, Lehman brothers, the investment bank of which Jamie Dimon was executive chairman, was a key participant in the financial market ecosystem that became increasingly dependent

A study published in the journal Applied Mathematics and Computation (AMCS) finds that when a mathematical construction is coupled to a particular type of data, it can give you the most precise model of that data. In this case the data might be information, like images in an image database, or something different: the location of a person on a map.

The construction we used was Gaussian mixture models. Likelihood analysis is used when we don't know the data; we just need some estimate of how they change over time, typically when an observation has been made, or an observation has already been made and we don't know what it's going to be like next time. In particular, we need to understand some kind of "mixing of noise" as a model for the data, which is what gives our theoretical model its power for understanding that data.

The key insight is that we can use the combination of our model (the one that is the best, based on our model predictions), our observations (images or locations) and our noise (what is outside the noise) to get a model of some kind for the data.

By coupling our model to the data we are getting accurate estimates for a very specific kind of information at a very specific data size.

To understand what could be driving the observation that the location of someone on the map changes over time, suppose we have no idea what the data means, and we use Gaussian Mixture Models that are good at modeling noise. If we try to fit a model to those observations, we get really good estimates for the location of people on the map, but we don't know how to understand those estimates.

To see this in context, suppose we have a large dataset with about a billion labels (for example, the labels of images in an image database, each label is an observation). That dataset has lots of images to represent. Then we fit a normal model to them. Then we see what that fits best.

For that, we can just look at the estimates as we go, but when applying that to something very specific like a location on the map, we should be looking to see if those were the right estimates, not just averages from all images. So, here's the question:

Can we use the models we see in the statistics on that dataset to understand how our location is changing over time? By "really understand," we mean that we should be seeing, in addition to the standard statistics (like x+1 or the mean), an estimated new location that is the same as the estimated previous location except with the new location added. So, how accurately can we estimate how people on the map are changing over time, even if we don't know their absolute values?

In particular we think we should be able to calculate the "mean shift," which is the average difference between the previous and new location. That should give us a way to understand what we're saying about a person in that location (and can also tell us which labels are most helpful).

To get the details for how to estimate that shift, I thought I'd write an article for this post. I also thought these calculations could help illustrate a particular way in which Bayesian techniques can give us a very precise model for very specific information. In fact, it's a type of inference that can give you a very precise model even for a much finer-grained set of information.

It also gives us a way to understand why many machine learning algorithms don't make predictions that are a great improvement on random guesses. The algorithm doesn't know about the noise, and therefore misses the shift.

My analysis is based on two main ideas: the first is that a lot of things can give you a good idea how much something has changed over time, even if you don't know anything about the data behind or about the noise. The second is that there's a simple relationship between how accurate a mathematical model is for one kind of data and how accurate one is at a much finer level of detail (or sometimes at the level of a small subset of data).

Let's look at an example that will give us more idea of the ideas. Here's a dataset of coordinates of an image with the color red. Then, for each label, we have some of the images showing an image with the same color (I chose the same color for simplicity). For these two images, in the same time interval, there's a mean shift of the center that is the same in both images:

So, this is an image and label pair. Let's look at how accurate this model is at estimating the mean shift:

The error is less than 1, so it's not very good. Then, suppose that there are four images of the center, and they each look like this; that's a pretty good model for the mean shift:

The error is about .1, giving it a very good model; on top of the two

The New York Post reported that the NFL is investigating Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's contract. The National Football League (NFL) is looking into if Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's contract is part of the Patriots' settlement agreement with the Wells Report. The NFL is looking into whether Brady committed a violation of the NFL's salary cap and salary-cap guidelines, the New York Post said.

According to the New York Post, Brady's contract is in jeopardy of being voided because the settlement agreement is not in compliance with the league's salary cap guidelines. This is the first time a player with a $1.8 million contract has been disciplined by the league for violation of the CBA. There is no indication this investigation will cause Brady to be suspended from the NFL.

Since the Wells Report released on March 10, the NFL has maintained that Brady's suspension was justified. However, on March 27, CBS anchor Bob Orr reported that the league was investigating whether the report stated the Patriots knew about deflategate. Orr quoted a source stating, "The league says it's still investigating, but there was a point during the investigation that they looked at it, and it seems like there was some level of knowledge, that they're trying to follow up on."

According to the report, Wells could not determine if there was evidence the Patriots knew about the deflation of game balls. Wells could not determine if the Patriots knowingly underinflated the balls, something Goodell said in his September press conference.

In a statement posted to the league's website, the commissioner said Brady's suspension was "long overdue."

The following is the full statement.

"Tom Brady's suspension was long overdue and serves as a reminder that cheating always has a face, and it is always our duty to find out who is doing it. I can assure you that we have done just that. The NFL conducted a thorough and independent investigation based on the information they had when they initially began their investigation.

"As the commissioner noted in yesterday's press conference, the investigation determined that footballs prepared by our staff for the AFC Championship Game met the standards that are set forth in the league's competitive rules. I have spoken briefly with Commissioner Goodell regarding this matter, and he knows that the integrity of the game is our responsibility. He is committed to it and fully expects the Patriots to cooperate fully with the league in any investigation that they may face. We want to assure everyone that we are cooperating fully with the authorities to provide as much information as we can so they can determine the exact cause of this situation."<|endoftext|>A couple of days ago a bunch of the older mods started reporting that the website where the mod download links are stored has changed and has been made a lot more secure. That is the thing I think about the most that the community has lost with the recent downtime. To me it's also a thing I don't think about too much. The more I think about it though the more I realize that the fact that something like that can affect a lot of modders, and is apparently the most basic service of a mod hosting site is something to keep in mind.

The idea of the original mods is to do stuff by hand and make the process of adding/removing stuff a bit more fun and enjoyable than just simply using the official tool. Of course, these days tools like Steam Workshop don't come with a ton of support but if you have a really good mod and you want to share it with the rest of the communities, that is something you can do by hand. This has made modding modders and people who upload content to the internet a rather complicated thing.

There are countless mods that have been created and created and then just forgotten about, but one of the reasons why the community is so good at modding is because it's a lot of work. If one could just add it to the launcher all of it would be handled for you.

You have mods that are more than just a skin, like some of the ones shown off with the mod spotlight and some of the "classic" mods which add new functionality or even new games. However, even some classic mods might have no idea how to add support for it in their own engines as they have not been ported to newer games, which leads to a lot of stuff "not being possible". When the game you are working on is built using a different engine/toolkits, you have to port each game individually if you would like to support the "classic" mods that are ported over. Some of the older mods might be built specifically for the engine/toolkit you are using, meaning one has to make custom support files. This makes building mods a lot more difficult than simply building standalone projects.

What you are left with at the end is a "perfect storm" scenario which leaves no mod maker happy except the publisher of the game. This would seem to me to leave no modder behind, but as the mods get bigger

In February 2008, the US embassy in Beijing reported that Chinese students studying in a US university had filed a formal complaint with the Chinese Consulate General in Baltimore, Maryland, and to the US Department of Education alleging "religious and political indoctrination" at the University of Maryland. The complainants accused the university of violating US religious freedom law, which states:

"Nothing in the laws of the United States shall be construed to prohibit or restrict any of the following: religious beliefs; religious activities; or the teaching or practice of religion or religious beliefs or political views on such topics as government, government policies, and social policies. The free exercise of religion and the free exercise of speech, and of the press and other forms of communication, are fundamental principles of a democratic society. "

The "religious and political indoctrination" allegations were part of a larger investigation, begun on January 18 and ending on March 7, into allegations that there were "institutional and individual acts that discriminate or appear to discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation or belief" at the university.

The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights sent a warning to the university in the form of eight pages of "concerning" documents regarding the investigation. Some of the documents cited in the OCR letter were "unredacted" and available only on private server of the Office of Civil Rights, while others bore dates and signatures of officials. In a series of letters that accompanied its "determinations" on the university's compliance with US law, OCR alleged that the "institutional practices of harassment, mistreatment and retaliation for religious beliefs" by a number of university employees and administrators constituted "inherently religious offenses against [student] plaintiffs."

In the letter, dated March 4, 2008, OCR wrote:

"Our review revealed many instances of anti-religious conduct and mistreatment that occurred during this investigation. Specifically, at the University, a number of anti-religious acts took place, including: harassment by University officials (e.g., refusing students, student associations, and student groups access to events and resources); failure to respond to complaints by students; refusal to cooperate with OCR's investigation and/or provide information that the OCR requested to determine possible violations; and other forms of retaliation such as demotion or dismissal based on religious belief."

The university later "disclosed" these allegations in public statements by President Robert Zimmer and Vice-President for Student and Academic Affairs John McCaw, both of whom acknowledged the investigation but did not address specific allegations of religious discrimination in any way. The university also posted on its website a letter, in which Zimmer acknowledged that the complaint "underlies the University's response to it in some respects" but failed to address those aspects of the complaint that had not already been addressed by the university as part of a comprehensive investigation into the university. As it turned out, in response to the complaint, the University had conducted an investigation of some of the same allegations in May 2007.

After the university "disclosed" the allegations involving students and their alleged "institutional and individual acts that discriminate or appear to discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation or belief," the university "adopted additional policies and procedures" that were intended to improve its relationship with "religious groups who want to participate in student activities at the University." Although the University of Maryland "agreed" that the "intimidating or intimidating conduct by University officials," as listed in its March 5, 2008, policies and procedures, "taken in the context of religious exercise," would fall under the definition of "religious harassment" by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, the University of Md. did not offer evidence in response to the OCR letter that such "intimidating or intimidating conduct" is a violation of the Free Exercise Clause. As a result, OCR ruled that the violations cited in the March 5, 2008, policies and procedures, as well as the university's failure to adopt a response that dealt with the specific allegations cited in its letter, constituted discrimination based on religion under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The OCR letter and related documents were the basis of a civil rights lawsuit in which the plaintiffs alleged that the University's handling of religious discrimination complaints constituted a "hostile environment" that deprived them of their constitutional rights of free exercise and free expression. One plaintiff in the federal lawsuit is a student and member of the Concerned Student 1950 group, whom OCR determined "discriminated, harassed and intimidated religious students, including his Christian group's leader" in a manner which was not permitted by the university's policies and procedures to exist. The suit also involves two current faculty members—including a former dean of the School of International Service—who are alleged by the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit to have participated in the university's alleged discriminatory acts against the plaintiffs.

Rudy Giuliani told Donald Trump at a private White House dinner last evening that he didn't know anything about Michael Flynn's Russia connections, after Flynn was forced to resign. Giuliani said he did not know because Flynn had previously said he didn't remember the dinner. This is not exactly a denial of Flynn's actions and Giuliani's comments appear to be nothing more than an attempt to put a positive spin on what Flynn did in regards to Russia as opposed to an outright cover-up. This should come as no surprise after what we have seen from President Trump on multiple occasions. If the President knows who his administration is hiding from, it's not to his country's benefit and perhaps it's more to his own benefit. The more important question, though, is why are those in the administration so afraid of being caught lying about something so important?

There is no doubt that the administration would have preferred to keep the truth about Flynn's activities with Russia secret and in the darkness. Flynn's dismissal, after all, could have opened the door for the FBI to investigate these ties, even if Flynn hadn't actually been caught attempting to hide them. Perhaps this will all come out in the next month, but one thing is certain: there is much more Russia-related information that will be revealed before Trump's "loyalty" is satisfied next month.

Pin 1 1K Shares<|endoftext|>What is it about the Internet that gets you to act out? Some Internet personalities have spent more time than others on this site, but I'm looking through a recent batch of e-mails that the staff has been receiving. (I'm not the source of these e-mails. Just some of the e-mails I'm looking through. And I'm not a particularly prolific person, either. But I think it's nice to see those e-mails coming in.) I don't have a point of view. I'm just looking at what some Internet folks are getting themselves into when they create web accounts that have "personal" names, and the e-mail systems that send out these accounts.

It appears we're all in a state of confusion. Why are some folks spending a lot of times making e-mail account names and e-mail addresses with special characters, and others not so, or at all? And why is this happening to a fairly large percentage of the e-mail systems that we all enjoy? If you don't want to be confused, then don't set your e-mail system's name as being a special "personal" name. Just take your username and a number, such as "sigtul", and use that for your e-mail. It doesn't get any more personal than that.

UPDATE: As it turned out, I'd been dealing with this for a while. We do have the ability to edit the system name that most people see, but we need to get everybody on board to see that. After lots of people got back to me about this, I decided to start a survey to get more feedback on it. I did a little more digging through the e-mail accounts of e-mail folks, and came up with another 10 or so names that we're still seeing. I've gotten a number of responses, most of which have confirmed the e-mail addresses as being for real, but there are a few that haven't. My advice to the individuals named in these e-mails is to keep digging, especially if their e-mail address is the same as theirs on the various mailing lists you subscribe to. We're starting to see how it changes over time as well - this might change. Please don't be discouraged and let me know if you've seen similar e-mail addresses in any of the e-mail systems you use. It can all just be a case of new names and e-mail addresses being born at a time. Thanks for reading: if you'd like to see just how many e-mail addresses are being set at special names, you can take a look at the e-mail addresses that have been created since I set up this page. Please don't give out your e-mail address.<|endoftext|>A team of researchers led by researchers at the Broad Institute has taken the biggest step ever undertaken to build computers built of DNA.

The idea the government should have a say about the internet's future is controversial, but for a short time the government seemed to go along with it. In 2000 the government passed Net Neutrality, a set of laws that ensured the internet could be free from discrimination.

Net Neutrality supporters said the laws protected the freedom of the internet and kept it open. Opponents, however, said those laws were a barrier preventing the public from being able to access content online while remaining anonymous.

So what is wrong with net neutrality?

Let me count the ways. First, some people believe this law will allow broadband companies to increase their profits by slowing down content that they don't agree with, or by not upgrading their network for faster services. Second, as a result of the new law, internet service providers are required to treat everyone equally, regardless of the website or service they use. There is no one's right or wrong here—if somebody uses the internet to send a file, you should be able to get it as well as the other guy.

As a result, net neutrality advocates claim, a company will be allowed to slow down sites that they don't like, or charge more for access to content on certain websites. Those companies are going to get even richer and more powerful as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) begin to give them new control over how people access content.

ISPs also are afraid that by imposing such regulations, the government will come to the rescue and regulate the industry in a way it wants to. They think ISPs will be more likely to start blocking traffic to certain websites and slow down traffic for others. But the reality might be more complex. It might happen that the government regulates ISPs more leniently than they would by a court order.

Third, the net neutrality laws are not working. The law is in place but not working. The internet is more open than ever but we still have a number of people who want to block sites such as Facebook. And we have a number who just want to slow down certain websites. So a lot of people are not happy with our current situation and what the government is trying to do with the law.

There is one last problem with net neutrality. The laws are flawed and not working. So instead of fixing the law, the government is trying to dismantle it. The plan to abolish open internet is out there. In June President Obama tried to get Congress to stop the FCC from passing net neutrality legislation on their own. The FCC said that President Obama would not veto that piece of legislation, but they were unable to get the bill passed under the current Congress.

However, Obama did not try to kill or repeal it, but he let it die. And to be clear, the laws he voted for were already in place. Instead, he is trying to change it into something he doesn't like. It's as if he doesn't want to be responsible and enforce the laws himself.

What should be changed?

The current laws have failed to deliver what the supporters of the original net neutrality laws said they would. The FCC passed a new version of net neutrality last week. The FCC will now ban providers from blocking or slowing down traffic for a specified period of time each month. That would give consumers more choice as to what sort of internet services they are able to get.

This would be a better way than trying to kill or repeal the existing open internet law.

But that may not be enough. In recent months the FCC has been working on more regulations. They want to prohibit companies from interfering with each other's traffic and from charging more to use some types of content. They also want companies to ensure that other websites that might be in the same physical neighborhood as the one they are already using are not throttled so fast they are slow.

So if these are just temporary changes, those who are against net neutrality should say those are insufficient.

We also agree with President Obama that there are some areas the US government can't meddle in. For example, health care and education.

But internet access is part of the US economy. Some of us should be concerned that the government might become more powerful than the people. What would happen if your internet provider started favoring one site over another? What if it became illegal to have an open internet? What if a private company could start blocking your access to some websites?

What if you don't like something about the existing net neutrality law, or think there are better ways to fix it? Why should you let the government decide on it?

We think there are better ideas for changing the current laws. One would be to try and change the law to encourage more competition in the industry by setting up some kind of public/private partnership.

We think there are other ideas out there to change the laws and create healthier internet for everyone. So please share with us your own suggestions.

A major theme of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) was "Stronger Together" — a message both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have used to motivate their crowds, especially their young supporters.

However, a recent Washington Post analysis found that Clinton had an advantage — roughly 1.5 million more pledged delegates than Bernie Sanders. Moreover, Clinton won 590 delegates outright; Bernie Sanders had 487; and 528 were allocated based on results from the remaining state caucuses.

These results indicate that the race continues to be a coin toss as the two candidates battle for the pledged delegate count ahead of the convention's July 25th. Here are the numbers from the Post's analysis:

For Clinton, that would represent a net increase of 0.07 percent from what Sanders would get for his pledged delegates and states combined. However, it would represent only 0.01 percent of the total number of pledged delegates.

When we factor in the effect of superdelegates on the pledged delegate count, Clinton gets 0.066 percent more pledged delegates than Sanders in total with superdelegates taking account.

In other words, Sanders gets roughly 3.5 million extra pledged delegates — about 1 percent of the 2016 total.

As we've already observed, this does not necessarily mean Clinton is inevitable in the Democratic Party or will end up with the nomination in Philadelphia. Rather, as we have said before, the fight will go down to the wire in the weeks leading up to Philadelphia, making this the ideal time to evaluate the candidates' chances.<|endoftext|>The New York Fed said on Tuesday it has lowered its economic growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018, citing weaker-than-expected trade and consumer spending due to an aging workforce, and the impact of Trump's anti-trade rhetoric.

The Fed's projections mark the first time it has reduced its outlook for growth next year, after it forecast an annual pace of 2.1% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018.

The cuts for 2017 were "largely a result of the adverse impact of global economic and financial developments on global trade and economic growth relative to the central bank's initial forecast," the New York Fed said in a statement.

Related: The $45 billion Trump deficit

The Fed is also projecting weaker growth in 2018 than the previous assessment, with annual growth reaching 2.4%, down from 2.7%. And the bank says the outlook is worsening because of rising uncertainty over the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code.

Ahead of the speech to Congress in May, the Fed warned the economy could face a negative shock from a U.S. infrastructure spending plan. Economists had forecast a slight slowdown in spending at the start of next year.

Ahead of the speech, one Fed official speculated the speech would cause "considerable economic uncertainty, probably for a while and potentially more than a year."

Related: Fed's Yellen: The real unemployment rate is a 'dwarf... and not 10%

The Fed also lowered its forecast for inflation from 2.8% to 2.2%, due to more uncertainty regarding the Trump administration's plans to overhaul trade policy.

In a research note, Wells Fargo economists, including Michael Gapen, Stephen Roach, and David Bloom, said this was the most serious downgrade since the Fed moved to raise rates in December 2015.

"At 5.4% year over year, inflation appears to have already slipped back into the Fed's 'expect' range, and is also just barely in the 'neutral' range," the Wells Fargo economists said.

Related: Trump won't be able to pass trillion dollars in tax cuts any time soon

If the Fed is wrong in its prediction of a slowdown in economic growth, it could increase investors' fears. But it also could help keep inflation in check, which could give some comfort to the Fed.

Gapen said this scenario would bring "some disquiet to the monetary policy committee."

The bank also lowered its long-term inflation estimate from 3% to 2.5%, while raising its short-term inflation estimate from 1% to 1.5%.

Gapen estimated the inflation outlook is still "considerably stronger than would be ideal, as the policy stance is still clearly accommodative in light of the economic growth projections and the projected path of the inflation rate."<|endoftext|>A Florida man has been indicted for making threats against the president's daughter.

BENGALURU: As the Indian space agency (ISRO) plans to boost its civilian workforce by 25% by June 2017, it has also been roped in by the local government to hire a few hundred junior employees to perform basic scientific and engineering support. The government has approved hiring of junior officials as part of an effort to improve the ISRO's workforce by 25%.An order from the Karnataka government to the Karnataka State Technical Educational Institutes (KSTIE) was issued on December 17 for the selection and recruitment of junior staff."As per the order, for the selection, an assessment of candidates is to be done including aptitude and experience. If the candidates are deemed fit, the selection will be finalised and the hiring will proceed," an official said. The recruitment period is from July 10 to October 15 in Bengaluru and from January 19 to March 20 in Mysuru. The first batch of 200-300 of the new Indian staff will be picked up.The decision is expected to generate jobs at an initial level of over 100, while the second phase will have about 2,000. It will, however, have to be completed by June 30 next year. The Karnataka state government has already asked students to participate in the process and it is also taking up a pilot project.On the issue of Indian astronauts, ISRO Chairman K Radhakrishnan is currently out of the country.

Well I've got a great plan to get us through this week and hopefully be in a great shape come next week.

You're a good person, how did it come to this?

The National Security Action Memorandum, the document that authorizes secret surveillance, reveals that the government has the power to surveil Americans who have no connection to international terrorism. The memorandum, which has been reported on only sporadically, applies to "anyone" whom the government has "reason to suspect" of engaging, or is suspected of engaging, in certain terrorist activities. "This includes organizations, groups, and individuals involved in international terrorism or activities related to terrorism," the memorandum explains.

In other words, the government has the power to surveil any American engaged in any kind of foreign or domestic activity that is deemed "suspicious" by its secret, classified interpretation of domestic activities that are considered "subversive."

Such a broad definition of "terrorist activity" provides the justification for broad surveillance by the National Security Agency, including electronic intercepts of Americans' communications without their consent.

"The purpose of the order is to protect the national security by promptly responding to suspected terrorist activity," the memorandum continues, noting that it is "only for the duration of the emergency and it is withdrawn at the earliest possible time." This is an extraordinary claim, intended to be an absolute bar against any further investigation of the surveillance.

The memorandum provides another troubling explanation for the existence of the NSA's domestic spying apparatus. The document's preamble claims that the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) was enacted after then-Senator Barack Obama threatened to filibuster the FISA bill "because it would undermine our ability to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States."

President George W. Bush claimed that the FAA was motivated by the "vague provisions" of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA). The FAA, however, was not passed in response to CALEA, but rather a year after it expired — and its provisions were made permanent as part of the FAA. As the New York Times previously reported, it's the result of that "vagueness" that has allowed the NSA's expansive domestic spying program to flourish.

Under the Obama administration, the NSA's activities have evolved into a "pervasive, pervasive" surveillance state, including its collection of virtually all domestic and international communications, according to the former senior Bush administration official.

The memo, issued in 2008, was declassified on January 27. The FISA Court, under the direction of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), has allowed the agency to gather vast amounts of Americans' information. The new memorandum confirms that this process continues.

The document also demonstrates that the NSA has no problem using its extraordinary powers to target and investigate members of political organizations that "pose a threat to national security."

In addition to monitoring political opponents who may pose a "threat to national security," the NSA has maintained that it can monitor "a broad set of organizations that may otherwise be excluded from" the agency's surveillance powers, such as organizations that are "involved in terrorism or activities related to terrorism."

Such a broad definition of "terrorist organization" gives the agency leeway to surveil and undermine the activities of any organization that poses a "threat to national security." This includes organizations that are not directly involved in terrorist activities, but whose members may engage in, train others in, or support political organizations engaged in "terrorist activities" that are seen as threatening to the American government.

All American organizations, including these political organizations, are at risk of being monitored and surveilled by the NSA, in defiance of the Fourth Amendment. If an agency believes that it can target any Americans, regardless of their membership in an organization or connection to international terrorism, it can make such a declaration as part of its FISA applications — and the NSA, as a result, is permitted to collect any data that is relevant to "foreign intelligence" and "counterintelligence" investigations. The FISA Court has granted this authority to the NSA.

The NSA can conduct electronic surveillance or electronic monitoring without a warrant, provided the government provides a "reasonable articulable suspicion" that the target is engaged in terrorism, or is a member of a terrorist organization. The NSA has applied this extremely broad interpretation of national security to many, if not all, Americans.

A federal judge, in a landmark case, recently ruled that the NSA's practice of accessing and processing American's communications without a warrant and judicial review violates the Fourth Amendment.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit for the release of 28 pages of secret law, detailing aspects of the NSA's operations.

The court document revealed by The Guardian, and also included in our FOIA request, details a program in which the NSA intercepted the communications of foreign diplomats and attempted to infiltrate their phone companies so as to collect their private communications. The intelligence agency obtained permission to tap the diplomats' telephone and e-mail communications from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court.

The spying was conducted under the broad framework of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, which gives the FISA Court an unprecedented power to authorize communications monitoring and

On the heels of the most controversial moment in Game of Thrones' run, Sunday night's episode ended with a big reveal: Bran Stark is really Jon Snow, the bastard son of Ned and Ned's youngest child. The show's creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, immediately issued the following comment: "This has all been a long time coming — and even longer said than done — and we can't wait to share this big moment with all of you."

A big moment — as the show has told us all season long, Bran and Jon are brothers, and the show knows this, even though the books don't explicitly tell them this. It's a big moment that has long drawn fan speculation, particularly in light of Jon's ambiguous parentage. Theories ranging from Ned and Ned's daughter, Lyanna Stark, who was taken by Rhaegar's forces to the Westerosi mainland with him, to the Starks themselves have speculated on whether this revelation will affect the course of the story.

[Spoiler alert: We won't be spoiling this big moment.]

Theories about that reveal range from the mundane ("What the hell is Bran really? This is great! He's finally a kid again!"), to the deeply philosophical ("This is pretty damn cool. I hope it continues in the books," says one commenter on the Hollywood Reporter's Thrones chat forum). But in the end, we won't know whether this episode ends Jon's war against the White Walkers, or the Red Wedding, with any kind of satisfying resolution. But I do know that many fans will be delighted, especially those who have been waiting for this scene for years.

The moment in question comes when Daenerys and her allies finally arrive in Westeros, landing in Braavos. At the port, she's forced to give Rhaegar his sword, Aegon's Kiss, because he no longer exists in the Iron Throne's books. Then she's confronted by a woman who tells her the tale of her birth, and that the last of her family is still waiting for her to return. At first she's disgusted by it, but then she recognizes her long-lost mother, who tells her of how she was killed by her own brother. She says that her true children — her bastard children — are watching her and whispering in her ear.

We don't know much about this woman apart from her description. At the end of last week's episode, she was identified by George R.R. Martin as Lyanna Stark, the eldest of all the Targaryens. It's possible that, much like her daughter, this woman is not Arya, or any of the other Stark children, but an other character in the series who will ultimately get revealed. The moment was, after all, the same moment that was used in the episode to reveal Ned's paternity. But the fact that her identity was kept secret, and that the revelation of her name and story would likely be greeted with much mirth among fans, only makes it more special.

[Spoilers for Monday's episode ahead, if you haven't seen it already]

Many fans of the novels are already excited about the possible reveal, saying that while the details of the revelation are currently unknown, the idea has long been bubbling below the surface. Even those without any knowledge of George R.R. Martin's source material have long suspected that Jon has Bran's DNA. And now, after seven years, after a major character died, at the moment we see him resurrected, we finally know that the reveal is true — and we're thrilled even if we don't get the big ending (and the possibility of a final Iron Throne-shaped bow).

Before we talk about why we're all so excited about this reveal, though — and what fans should expect — let's briefly look at how the story that follows it could go down.

When was the last time we saw Lyanna Stark? — and whether she'll be back.

A lot of viewers got really excited about the story to follow Sunday night's episode, with much of the speculation revolving around how it might tie up the end of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga. The last we saw Lyanna was just before Ned Stark and the Starks arrived at the Tower of Joy during the second novel in the book series, A Storm of Swords. If the two novels are loosely adapted as a TV series (which they might have to be, since George R.R. Martin's current contract requires the author to finish the series by an unspecified deadline), that scene in A Storm of Swords is the last we've ever seen.

Now, let's assume this scene took place in the last six books — six books are roughly the time frame between A Dance With Dragons and Thrones, the final two volumes of the series. A Storm of Swords was published in 2001, while Thrones came out in 2011. Therefore, a story involving

The way many people lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. But this won't keep them weight off – it won't even slow the rate at which they go off sugar.

A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that dieters who stuck to strict low-calorie diets in the face of a sugar-sweetened beverage restriction had no more weight-loss success than those who switched their calories to non-caloric beverages.

"This raises some concerns about people cutting back on sugar-sweetened beverages," says Dr. Deborah Blumberg, a dietitian who co-wrote the article. "Our study is a reminder that they can't be the only choice. They do have an impact. If you're on a diet to lose weight, you should limit your consumption of sugar," she says.

The findings build on previous research that has found that there's just no evidence showing that dieters who cut back completely on sugary drinks can lose weight. But previous studies show that cutting back just a little bit on sugars – and then keeping it that way – can have a big impact.

The current study looked at the effects of six weeks of daily caloric restriction or switching diet types, in which participants were cut back a little bit on sugar-sweetened beverages but kept their calories from those drinks the same. The authors found that those who stuck with an 8 percent reduction in calories from sugary drinks actually lost an average of one pound less over the six weeks than those in a different group who reduced their sugary beverages by 8 percent.

But the benefits didn't seem to persist for six weeks.

"I wanted to see if the weight would come off or the weight loss still be there after six weeks," says Dr. Linda Bacon, a professor of nutrition sciences. "It didn't seem like the study group would make any difference at the six-week mark, the same as it didn't seem like any benefit is being maintained over six weeks."

What's more, when the groups were switched, the participants who had switched to non-caloric beverages also reported that they were losing weight but not retaining their weight loss. And among the group that continued to restrict sugary sodas, none of the participants had regained their lost weight.

For the researchers, it could mean some people would be better off sticking with a diet high in fruit and vegetables. "That said, a high fruit and vegetable consumption will also increase the risk of weight gain," Blumberg says.

The current study was small and didn't fully explain why weight loss in the low-calorie group failed to last beyond a month. The study didn't control for the participants' eating habits or activity levels prior to the study, so there is the potential that other factors – like health conditions or medications – were responsible.

More research is needed to determine how long the benefits from restricting sugary drinks remain.

The American Heart Association recommends adults who eat at least 2,000 calories a day – just over 600 from sugary drinks – to limit intake of added sugars to no more than 5 percent of total calories. They also encourage people on diets to choose whole grains and fruits.<|endoftext|>The World of the Dao, Volume 1

Annotated Bibliography

J.W. Davies

1. Introduction:

The Dao, or Great Way , is the foundation of all the great religions of the world. As far as ancient Chinese thought is concerned, there is not one religion which has not, at one time or another, recognized the Dao, or Great Way, as the source of religious, philosophical, and ethical knowledge, and of the true and the good. Its authority in the great Chinese tradition goes back to at least the 3rd century BC, when Wu Chengwei, the founder of the School of Shu , and Liu Hsia , the founder of the School of Zen , both stated it as their source. Thus they were both not only the first to recognize the Dao as the core of Chinese thought; they also were the first to claim the original state of things was the Dao.

While Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism may share the same concept of "greatest and most perfect" reality, but they differ in all other important aspects. Confucianism and Taoism both stress the value of action. While Confucianism is concerned with action or the achievement of success in life; Taoism stresses the role of thought. Furthermore, Confucianism is concerned with maintaining discipline for the good of your family and your clan, while Taoism has a much more altruistic aspect. This is illustrated in the two quotes below:

The true Tao is the Way .

In the universe, the principle of nonaction is the greatest virtue, not the way. This is what is called the "Dao of Nonaction

The National Football League (NFL) and NFL Players Association (NFLPA) have launched a new joint venture called the "Coaching Education Fund," which has been created to promote the benefits of the NFL and NFL's coaching education programs to the youth of America. The joint venture will focus on a number of issues facing the game with respect to education, education reform, and NFL and NFLPA education support programs.

On July 1, 2013, in consultation with former and current NFL coaches, current and former NFLPA head officials and college coaching directors, NFL and NFLPA officials will convene in California to focus on a number of issues facing the game that focus on "education reform, education support, student-athlete health/safety and education support programs in football, with an emphasis on supporting and promoting the importance of teaching the fundamentals of football."

In a press release, NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith indicated what some of his priorities will be at this joint venture:

"Over the years, I've heard repeatedly that our sport has a lot of misconceptions about how good we need to be as a society. We need to make the game safer," NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith said. "That is why the NFLPA will be holding a joint venture for the first time to help bring an end to head-to-head tackling. "There are two things that are hurting, not helping, the game of football," Smith continued. "One is the culture that encourages head hitting in a game of football. The second is in-game coaching. Teaching the fundamentals of football need to be made more accessible, more available to young people. "Teaching the fundamentals of football means teaching young men how to block, move, hit, cover and tackle. If you do not teach them these things, how can a person become a great player in football? How can a player have the potential to become great if they do not practice these fundamentals? "The NFL and NFLPA's vision of a positive and positive impact on player health and safety is something we want to continue to push for and make our message the same across all professional sports."

A number of issues will be discussed at the joint venture:

-The need to teach children and youth how to play the game safely, especially in tackling situations that are prevalent in youth football.

-Child abuse in the NFL, including the rise in concussions in recent years.

-The importance of teaching children how to hit with technique and correct technique, rather than simply body impact hitting.

-The role of the Head Coach as the primary educator in educating youth.

-The need for a player union leadership role with regards to youth and youth coaches.

-Teaching youth to know what is expected of them and how they are expected to perform.

-The need of educating coaches and training staff on the importance of teaching the fundamentals.

Coaches, coaches' spouses, NFL employees on- or off-the-field, and youth will be invited to attend the two-day meeting in conjunction with the creation of both the NFLCoachingEffort.com website, the first education portal for NFL coaches and staff, and the NFL and NFLPA Educators Forum (PESF). (Visit NFLCoachingEffort.com for a link to register for a free account.)

"We appreciate the opportunity and support provided by the NFL and the NFLPA to explore ways to improve the overall health and safety of youth football," stated David Borst, NFLPA COO. "We look forward to this initiative with the support of the NFL and NFL coaches, as well as the continued support of the game's youth, coaches, players and parents."

The first two NFLCoachingEffort.com educational portals, which will be launched over the course of the week, will provide access to the NFL's latest concussion protocols and updates concerning head trauma in football. The other NFL-related education portal will serve to educate parents and youth about the ways in which sports participation can increase their participation in physical activity, and help them reduce the incidence of injury and chronic conditions.

"Our players, coaches, staff members and our fans all rely on us to work with them and support them as they reach their health and athletic development objectives," said NFL Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jeffrey Miller. "Our joint initiative with the NFLPA will provide a great opportunity for us to provide information and education to all youth, coaches and players who may be looking to learn more about the risks and benefits posed by head injuries. The joint venture is not only designed to educate the American youth of American football, but it will help us understand what is really needed to make it safer for sports participation."

1) The first contract was for $10.2 million for "production design services to integrate an F-35A aircraft with the Joint Strike Fighter to determine the suitability of the F-35A to perform its planned mission packages, in connection with the F-35 production."

The contract was awarded to the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and was expected to be for at least three months but is likely to extend for about two years.

2) A contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin for the initial delivery of 100 combat ready F-35As, plus additional aircraft ordered in two to three years time. This contract involves two different contracts:

"The contract was awarded to LMT, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. It will provide, as part of a multi-year effort, integration and planning services for development, engineering, and manufacturing services and logistics to the U.S. Air Force on development of F-35C Block 2B aircraft. The LMT-N Grazier Joint Program Office will develop and manage program support and logistics for the aircraft.

When we see an image or video, our visual memory is triggered to think about what we saw. This is all happening non-consciously, and is called a neural phenomenon referred to as imagery .

You can experience imagery without consciously seeing or thinking anything about it, just by thinking about it. Just like how a person may be reminded that the back of her hand is blue, the brain can be reminded of images through neural pathways, even when we are not consciously aware of them.

This may be because we are all trained to associate the images or sensations we get as triggers with certain words or concepts, or based on some physiological process.

However, some people are just more visual than others. Some of them can become so good at looking at things, we have no idea they are being reminded of visual input.<|endoftext|>CAMBRIDGE (CBS) — Cambridge police are investigating after reports of a stolen car were found on University Avenue.

It happened just after 3 a.m. Monday as a man was walking home near Washington Street and University Avenue.

A Cambridge police spokesman said the car was reported stolen from the 1100 block of College Street.

A Cambridge police officer saw the vehicle, but stopped after they got off of University Avenue because of the traffic.

While they were stopped, officers saw a man hiding from the officer inside the crashed car and tried to detain him for police activity. The Cambridge detective who arrived on the scene shot the suspect and he was found to have stolen items inside the car.

It is nothing short of shameful for a political party that claims to be the party of equal rights to stand behind politicians like Roy Moore, who has taken a public stance against LGBTQ rights, and Alabama Senate candidate, who has repeatedly made statements about his opposition to equal rights for LGBTQ people. The time for the Republicans to step back from their homophobia, sexism and bigotry, and start respecting the LGBTQ community is now . It is time for the GOP to make a serious effort to show their support for the LGBTQ community and to oppose any action that would take us back in time. I propose a simple solution. If the Republican Party wants to have any chance of winning in Alabama, they should drop their support for Roy Moore and his disgusting anti-LGBTQ stance.

The Alabama Senate election is coming up on December 12. Many people wonder what impact it would have when you start getting rid of a handful of state Senate seats. The answer is that it would have a significant impact. For the last 4-8 years, the Republicans have had a majority in the House of Representatives due to gerrymandering and because of the fact that the Republicans run the majority of House races across the country, they control the redistricting process. In a normal election cycle, this means the Democrats, who tend to win more elections, control their House votes and control their redistricting process. This was not the case this last two years, however, due to the fact that the Republicans and their Senate majority took advantage of the fact that no Democrat won a single Senate race in 2012 to rig the redistricting process.

They did exactly this. The Republicans drew gerrymandered lines, so the Democrats would only have 51 seats. The Republicans would be forced to keep winning 50%+1 of the vote to stay in power. This is exactly what has happened. Due to the House redrawing, the GOP now controls the redistricting process, and this allows them to control the seats. The Senate is one of the few remaining democratic institutions left in this country. They still have an enormous amount of power over who represents them. The Senate is the chamber where they send their own Supreme Court members. Without the power of the Senate, Trump and the Republicans are forced to choose between the will of the voters, and the Supreme Court. And when the Supreme Court issues a ruling against Trump or his party, or when they put a friend's or relative's rights above women having control over their own bodies and reproductive lives, we may see just how far they will go when it comes to their hatred of LGBTQ people.

It is time for the Republican Party to grow some balls and drop Roy Moore as their Senate candidate.<|endoftext|>The government of Israel is making every effort to ensure that the Arab-Israeli citizens of the state are happy in their state, with a new ad campaign aimed at improving lives for the Arab community throughout the country.

The University of North Carolina is at the frontlines of a heated debate over the rights of transgender students. But when I visited the school, I saw nothing that would suggest the debate is anywhere close to over.

Instead, I found a sprawling campus with a student population that is almost equally split along gender lines, and a campus increasingly polarized by a series of clashes between conservative evangelical Christians and progressive, secular faculty and administrators. Most of the students I was talking to were from conservative families. They were from high-poverty neighborhoods. They came from religious families, and many of them were from evangelical churches – the school's spiritual center.

The only visible differences between conservative students and those from other schools or social groups were the differences in their dress and speech, their social status (the richer ones tended to have more money).

The campus is surrounded by a sea of giant, multi-colored Confederate flags that symbolize the southern secessionists of the early 20th century. To this day, their banners are ubiquitous on public property and at every event. They were flown at the North Carolina Legislative Building during the special session that led to the state's House Bill 2, a law that, among other things, bans transgender students and employees from using restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.

The controversy surrounding that law reached new, high-level national prominence last weekend when Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, praised it during a private meeting with lawmakers.

In many ways, my visit was predictable from a sense of what North Carolina has become. The state's leaders have fought tooth and nail to be a leader for "protecting our values," as Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said in a speech on the floor of the legislature on March 29. The idea had been a bipartisan one, in the early '90s. Then, after Republican Gov. Jim Hunt (R) made a mistake and appointed Democratic lawmakers to his cabinet, Republican legislative leaders worked to undo the mistake, first pushing a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage in the state and later banning "sex" from employment protections.

The battle over the bathroom law made the stakes even higher, in ways that go beyond the symbolism of the Confederate flag and the debate over academic freedom. "When we talk about protecting your rights, we need to get these rights right," McCrory told the Charlotte Observer. "We don't get to do it half-way."

North Carolina is a state that has already been designated one of the nation's most conservative, thanks to McCrory's policies. The state's unemployment rate ticked up to 8 percent last year as North Carolina passed some of the harshest anti-LGBT legislation in the country. The state's economy suffered from a decline in tourism, the closure of hundreds of textile mills, a sharp erosion in the tax base, and the loss of nearly $3 billion in annual revenue.

As a result, even with the massive drop in the state's employment outlook, Republicans in Charlotte were quick to blame the government for not doing enough to promote "responsible and stable lifestyles." One bill would have barred transgender students from using the bathroom that matched their gender identity, while other bills in the legislature would have limited bathroom access for transgender people and, in one case, prevented cities from passing "common sense" ordinances like allowing transgender people to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity.

The legislature's efforts were widely condemned by activists, business interests and government officials. In his State of the State address, Gov. McCrory pointed to the economic benefits his administration has been able to draw from the state:

A recently released state report showed that the North Carolina's economy has outperformed every other state in the South by an extraordinary margin. In addition to North Carolina's highly skilled workforce and world-class universities, this report shows we have the most productive workforce in the country. North Carolina is an example of how a business-friendly regime has attracted businesses like Google to locate here while still protecting employee rights and promoting environmental protection.

The state's economy does have its problems, and they have been caused at least in part by a lack of education funding and liberal policies. But it's impossible to ignore the fact that North Carolina's policies are also at the root of most of its problems. McCrory claims that some of his policies have helped to keep the unemployment rate low. But North Carolina has one of the biggest income gaps in the country. According to a Brookings Institution report from 2015, more than a quarter of high school graduates (27 percent) are functionally illiterate, compared with 8 percent of middle school graduates and 3 percent of college graduates. In a state with so many unemployed young adults, the effects of that are serious.

When I asked a number of students why they felt threatened by transgender people, most noted the effects the policy had had on friends of theirs, for example. Another student told me, "I was friends with a transgender girl who is now in college. When

I read some things like this to you.

We're not living in the old days.

We were in the old days.

But today, the world is going to hell in a handbasket.

And the world has to realize that we don't need those big guns any more.

Because if they shoot us, then the world is going to live in fear forevermore.

Because there will never be another war to break those peace loving, peaceful people of this earth.

I know that you hear that now, but don't forget what happened in 2008.

And then in 2012.

They're like, "yeah, but we all know it was all the good old days once."

But I got news for you.

If there ever was a good, old time for something like that, it was over a hundred years ago.

And they can call the Civil War "good."

But when the world was better—well, it didn't last.

And they can do the same with the First and Second World Wars.

And the Vietnam War.

Because they were.

We're in bad times, and we're seeing the beginning of the end of a bad time.

And we've got to think about the future of this generation, and it's scary and scary because we can't let them see us as weak.

We can't let them see us as scared.

We're going to get through this, because we've got to believe that we're all the same. Not going to go for the easy route.


The first step is to see that our way of life is strong because it is strong.

It's not some newfangled thing.

It's the foundation on which your way of life—your whole way of life—is built.

And we need to make sure that it doesn't come crashing down tomorrow.

Let it last as long as it's worth it—because it may not be worth it tomorrow.

And then we can look forward to the better times that are coming our way.

As long as they're called "now."

And I'm gonna tell you something about "now"—when it comes right into this sentence, it is totally fine.

I can see it.

For you get used to this now.

It's like a rock that was dropped in a bottomless place—and you have to come up and get it.

And they tell you that you can't climb the mountain if you can't see the valley.

Well, I'm telling you that you can do whatever you want, but if you don't get it right the first, second, or hundredth time you just got to get away from the mountain.

You're a bird of prey, you can't stay on its eggshell forever.

The rock is always there to make sure you see it through.

Yeah, but I'm telling you—the real work doesn't start until you see the valley. And a whole other world.

And if you just keep doing what's on this page until it's right, you'll see the valley and you'll want to be there.

And you'll start getting the rest.

And when it's right, the rest will come.

Because if you don't get it the first, second, or hundredth time, it's never going to get right.

If it doesn't get right, it's never going to be there.

I see a lot of stuff in this book and I hear a lot more than I read.

I'm still learning like hell.

I just have to continue to do my research, work my butt off, and then get my hands dirty.

And then I tell you about the stuff I learn when I do my hands dirty.

And you can make me the best friend you've ever had. That's why I'm here.


I need you to take the other path.

Do you want people to know what you're really about and what you really stand for?

Do you want to stand for something stronger?

To be your own true version?

Take the other path.

Do you want to be a man or woman of honor?

Don't get married early. Don't settle.

Don't give up.

Be good to each other, be kind to each other, be gentle to each other.

Be real to each other, not because of this.

You can do it because of this.

All of it you will do if you are real, and you are real because you are here.

And when you're real to each other, you'll be real to

"He is the most powerful man in Saudi Arabia, and he can do whatever he wants to do - just ask the Israelis. It took them more than 40 years of a brutal invasion to get the West Bank."

He then claimed that Saudi Arabia wanted to take control of all of Israel in exchange for peace "with no concessions".

"He wants to have a peace deal with the Palestinians where he controls all of Israel, a demilitarised Palestinian state, and then we will withdraw our troops," he said.

"All he needs is a small Israeli settlement on the land he wants to control, and with his help, he will get it - it will never happen.

"And he said to the Israelis that 'We will keep Gaza for you'."

He also called for the creation of a Palestinian state along the 1967 border, and said that the "Palestinian issue is not really about the 1967 borders; there is another one."

"We cannot accept that Israel will have a single square kilometre of Palestinian land," he said. "We have to create a Palestinian state on the 1967 border.

"Then the Israelis, for example, they don't like it, but as long as they don't have control of Gaza, it (a Palestinian state) is impossible."

Mr Trump's speech, which lasted well over two hours, saw him praise his predecessor as president, Mr Obama, before he declared his decision to launch a military strike against Syria's government, which was criticised by allies.

He continued: "I'm sending an open message to the world that the United States of America is ready to strike military targets of the Assad regime, but this mission is not about going after Assad.

"This mission is to eliminate the evil of radical Islamic terrorism, and to leave Syria in peace, on which there can be no lasting peace without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians."

He then accused President Obama of taking America "off course" during his presidency.

"He made a terrible mistake by starting a military action in Libya without any UN approval and then he was forced to pay a very expensive price," he said.

"So it was the president who started wars without cause, without support of Congress and in many instances in a very very wrong way. When will President Obama realise that his legacy consists of four more years and the destruction of our country?"

The National Security Agency (NSA) may have been monitoring President Barack Obama's personal email accounts for years. The news was first reported by The New York Times on Thursday.

On Friday, a number of news outlets, including CNN and the Wall Street Journal, reported on the new details. The Times published part of its story — titled "The N.S.A. Collects and Seizes Millions of Phone Records a Day" — under the headline, "[A]s far as anyone knows it's never been done before."

"No American has ever seen the N.S.A. collecting records on hundreds, if not thousands, of people at a time," the report read. "According to one former intelligence agency official, it was not until a few weeks ago, after an aggressive lobbying campaign by the Obama administration, that N.S.A. officials were even aware that the program existed."

The administration was reportedly unaware that the program existed until April 11, when an administration official was asked if the agency had indeed "incidentally collected" any records on "lawful U.S. persons" and specifically about "President Obama."

The Times adds that the president is not the only one who has been subject to the NSA's surveillance. "If Obama and his aides had known their emails were being collected, they would have attempted to use another account," the report said, referring to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and General David Petraeus, according to former agency officials.

The Washington Post cited other former intelligence officials who confirmed that the monitoring of "a small portion" of the U.S. population was an NSA standard practice.

"I can't think of anyone who was targeted for any particular reason other than it was something that we had been asked to do," Andrew M. Inglis, a former deputy director of the NSA and one of the agency's most prominent members, told the Post.

The report by the Times follows the Guardian's disclosure Friday that the agency has had "a secret court order for years compelling phone companies to turn over huge amounts of personal data from their customers on an ongoing daily basis."

"The scale of the N.S.A.'s database is so vast that there is no reasonable way for the agency to know exactly which phone numbers it is seeking," the Guardian reported.

The Times article noted that "this program has also been questioned by Republican members of Congress."

According to the Times, Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told The Washington Post last year that he "was troubled by the disclosure of the N.S.A.'s telephone number database, which he acknowledged 'inadvertently' collects the records of almost everyone in America."

In response, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in July of this year that the National Security Agency was not "targeting individuals domestically."<|endoftext|>For Immediate Release, June 28, 2016 Contact: Zachary Bail, (510) 707-4457, zbail[at]prodeathpenalty.org

Nationally, more prisoners than ever are on death row

More than 1,750 people are currently being held in state prisons and federal prisons, each holding people for the death penalty. In California alone, 603 people are on death row and another 49 people are on death row in federal prisons.

The total annual number of executions in U.S. history has been roughly 2,850. This year so far, there have been 514 executions. Of those that have occurred in the U.S., 7 people have died.

"It is clear that California has a large death row population with no end in sight," said Zachary Bail, director of the Pro-Death Penalty National Prisons Project. "The state must address this situation immediately by putting in place safeguards to prevent even more people from being put to death, and must also eliminate the racial overrepresentation of people of color in these prisons, which is particularly egregious."

This year, the death penalty has been at the forefront of the national debate over racial justice in the United States. Since the 2014 death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. While national opinion polls show that a majority of Americans reject the death penalty in all settings, a majority of whites—and a minority of blacks—still support it.

Bail's group is an American delegation to the UN Human Rights Council's periodic review session of the Universal Periodic Review of States, the United Nations body responsible for monitoring whether states meet the standards for human rights and rule of law. The delegation's mission to the UN Human Rights Council is an outgrowth of Bail's and other activists' work to reform the U.S. death penalty.

"He [Pierce] is doing very well and it is great for him to have the national anthem here.

"A lot of people like playing football. Unfortunately, he is a very big man and they are playing him too.

"It is important for the players to know that you are not alone. The national anthem is not something for one person, it is a group of people and what we did was respectful.

"We have respect for the flag and for those who have sacrificed so much for the flag. We don't care what color you are, you have a sacrifice for the flag"

The team was not made aware of the flag-waving until they were in the tunnel after an hour's break.

"We just went through a drill," said Gomes. "We are all aware of the flag. It is a big deal and we respect it.

"It is a special thing for everybody and not just the players. To go to a football match of that size is great for the team.

"We are all part of this great game and the game day will be fun."

After the game, coach Eddie McGuire said: "It [Pierce] is probably one of the best at what he does.

"He has the respect of the players and he wants to play the rugby league games."

Pierce is on a five-match NRL suspension for a late tackle on Sydney Roosters skipper Paul Gallen.

The 31-year-old, who was on the bench for the Roosters' last game against Parramatta, has been granted a reprieve after being cleared by the NRL judiciary.

The NRL issued a statement confirming that the judiciary had deemed Pierce had not intended to harm Gallen with a tackle.

"The match review committee has determined that the incident should have warranted a grade one striking offence to reduce the player's grade and grade two engaging in rough conduct," said the statement.

"In consideration for Paul's age and the seriousness of the incident, a grade one offence has been assessed in accordance to the NRL's guidelines for Grade and rough conduct offence.

"The incident was not referred to the NRL judiciary for further assessment. We have communicated that determination to the player and his management."

The hackers' first targets were financial institutions (i.e., JPMorgan Chase (JPM)), including the company's headquarters in Manhattan, New York, in an email to a JPMorgan Chase executive. They then moved on to media organizations, including ABC, NBC, CBS, The Onion, The New York Times, Fox and NPR, to obtain more emails, including personnel records (including for employees' spouses and children) and data pertaining to Sony, in an all-points bulletin targeting financial firms.

This new group, TrueSec, is comprised of an assortment of hackers who hack various targets in exchange for financial compensation, according to reports in Der Spiegel, The Sydney Morning Herald and other publications. According to a report by Motherboard, "the group's modus operandi is much more advanced" than that of Phantom, a hacker who made the acquaintance of the group in 2014.

Motherboard reports that the group has been responsible for several high profile hacks, including that of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the biggest hack ever, in 2015, and a huge breach of Ashley Madison, one of the world's largest dating sites. (The website was reportedly compromised earlier this year, leading to the leak of more than 37 million user records.)

Motherboard says "TrueSec," who allegedly hacked U.S. financial firms in October 2015 and in 2016, has so far been behind a few high profile hacks, including that of Sony, in which hackers claim to have obtained nearly 80 gigabytes of sensitive data, including internal email accounts and film and television plots.

The following is a list of characters in the American film series Godzilla.

Contents show]

Toho Godzilla Edit

Toho Godzilla (ゴジラギドラン) is Japanese version of Godzilla from the movie Monsters, directed by Ishiro Honda and released in 1954.

An official Godzilla (ゴジラギドラ) was released on DVD in 1999 by Toho and the American video game companies Atari and Hasbro. It is also available on Blu-Ray disc, with high definition, and digitally in high definition from the video game company Retro Studios under the title "The King of the Monsters - Toho Godzilla".

The character was first introduced in a TV series called Godzilla: Kaijū no Gyakushū in 1964, and the character was first seen in a live-action film version in 1959 with Hiroshi Teshigahara in the title role. The film is now considered to be one of the most influential Japanese live-action films of all time. The film was later followed by the TV series in 1964, which was later followed by a live-action film version of it, as well as several TV specials and two Godzilla feature films including the first and last one, and the other two films as well, each of which were based on the film.

For some reason, Toho also decided to rename his movie version of Godzilla as "Godzilla Kaijū no Gyakushū", or simply "Godzilla" in English. The film was also renamed and re-released in North America again as Godzilla: Final Wars (ゴジラギドラー) (aka Godzilla: Kaijū no Gyakushū Kaijin), however a DVD version of this was released as King of the Monsters (ゴジラギドラ) by Toho.

After the release of The Return of Godzilla in 1954, King of the Monsters was released in Japanese cinemas during the "Godzilla Week" from November 21 to November 27 of the same year (the same week as The Return of Godzilla) and then in North American cinemas from March 5, 1958 to June 5, 1960.

In 1968, a Toho live action film of King of the Monsters entitled King of the Monsters II (ゴジラギデス2) (aka Godzilla 2) was released.

A "Live-action film of Godzilla (Godzilla Kaijū no Gyakushū)" film was released in 1976 by Toho.

Toho released a two-volume English comic adaptation called Godzilla: King of the Monsters in the early 1980s along with the novelization of Godzilla: The Wrath of Taikai. The English comics were later released in paperback form and in hardcover form in 2015, with a comic adaptation titled Godzilla: The King (Godzilla: Dai Honbu) released alongside them.

Godzilla is sometimes referred to as King of the Monsters and King of Monsters; it is unknown why the terms were dropped from the title.

History Edit

Godzilla was inspired by the Kami, the Japanese deities associated with creation and creation itself. His appearance resembled that of a giant squid, and he was called "Kaijū (Kaijuu: literally, Great Dragon or Dragon Prince)", hence his Japanese name; it is unknown whether the name is based on his actual Chinese title (Kongō), or simply the name given to him by the Japanese. The name "Kaiju" is a common Japanese name, and it may be that this is a reference to these kaijūs.

Godzilla's first appearance in 1954 comes from an early story written in 1954 by Masahiro Konishi entitled "Giant Monster Stories", which originally was to be the first installment in an anthology. However, the story was abandoned, and the story "Kaijuu no Gyakushū (Godzilla), The Monster from Beyond the Earth" (ゴジラギドラの大作戦) was written during this period.

After the film itself, Godzilla continued to appear in a number of books and other forms, and in 1985, he was officially introduced to the world through animated films, comics, the live-action "Godzilla versus Destoroyah" series, and even other works including a popular magazine series. From 2004 to 2007, Japan was represented in the live-action film, and in 2010, a live action film came.

In 2001, it was announced that, with the aid of Toho, Toho would again make a "King of the Monsters" live-action film, this time following the story of the original 1954 film, King of the Monsters, which had received many positive critical reviews.

Toho has since released a number of comic adaptations of Godzilla's history and mythology, mainly focusing on his origin stories.

In 2012, a Japanese live action television series (with English language dubbing) of King of the Monsters was released. In 2013

On the morning of June 6, 2015, two men wearing vests and ski masks climbed up a small hill and opened fire on a crowd of people attending a gay pride parade in the French city of Nice.

Fourteen were killed, including a French police officer, and around 70 others were injured before the three gunmen were killed by police. Their motives remain unclear, but the attacker in particular was known to law enforcement; he was on a list of extremists banned from entry into France and had been under close surveillance for around six months.

What is clear, however, is that the attacker's motives were driven by his anti-gay beliefs, which can be gleaned from the words he spoke when they arrested him. The following is a translation of his statement, given to authorities and later leaked to the media:

"I'm sorry for what I did, but Allah asked me to do it […] I did it for the Muslims. You are killing your children, taking their women as slaves, eating their meat and drinking their blood. Your prophet Mohammad did the same, and you're doing it now, so everyone will know."

The translation, of sorts, is by Aboo Takoob, a former jihadist turned secular Islamist, who has worked closely with the Islamic State. He tells us about the translation and the incident that inspired it.

VICE: Can you describe the translation of the attacker's statement? How long did it take you to get in-depth with him?

Aboo Takoob: I first asked if I could give a translation of the speech. I had worked with the terrorists, and they were quite transparent, and they told me that the person they wanted to get a message out to would be a French police officer. I decided to translate the same speech that they gave me, the one they had heard the day before, the one in which they confessed. They said that in this speech they wanted a message sent to the Islamic State and to French society, as well as a message to the French state as a whole and to the Muslims everywhere, so they chose a policeman or police officer as someone to say this speech.

The language used was English and not French. In the speech they used slang and terms, such as "pigs," that I had never heard before. Those are the words they used in the speech. Afterward, we found his handwriting and some of the handwriting of his wife, the one who wrote the confession letter. The Arabic writing was all right, the French was not.

I couldn't really make out this speech without the help of a translator and the person who had written it to. It's really rare to speak to a person as a prisoner, because of the security and the strict rules. I needed permission from the judge and the prison authorities, and I had to write this down. I read the transcript three or four times, then I translated the speech before anyone could read it, but when they finished reading that, I went back to it. I didn't use the exact wording he used, only parts of what he said, but his intentions were the same.

It's rare to speak to a person as a prisoner, because of the security and the strict rules. I needed permission from the judge and the prison authorities, and I had to write this down.

How did the incident spark controversy in the city of Nice?

During the funeral I spoke to someone who had worked as a journalist. She was a close friend of the victim, a woman from Nice who went into business with him as an escort. She said that she couldn't stop thinking about what had happened. She was a Muslim, and it was a very difficult moment for her because she had known this man for years and never thought about it until later.

In my view those acts of terrorism were totally and totally inspired by what they believed. I wouldn't say that what they did was the same as Daesh, because they're both extremist groups, but Daesh was formed by a particular ideology that they started out with. Their goal is to have their kind of system across the world. So it's a very simple ideology: to conquer what they want to conquer. It's a very simple way of thinking.

So this man's motivation may have been that, as he explained to a friend a few hours before the attack, he wanted to create a caliphate, a state, as he put it.

The French state has taken very strong measures against people like him. But those measures were never meant to be permanent. They aim to help those people who are not radicalized when, in their own way, they become radicalized and then move toward Daesh. Many of those who are stopped were actually just being vulnerable.

"He wanted to create a caliphate, an Islamic State, on the whole; he had a very clear ideology to do something like that. And you could see it right from the beginning; from the first

A lot of the discussion of U.S. involvement in Ukraine in the news lately has been concerned with the possibility of a military strike against Russia -- the sort of conflict that has escalated every two years since the end of the Cold War. However, it's also worth talking about the broader political ramifications of this action, with Ukraine's newly elected president, Petro Poroshenko, suggesting that the U.S. and NATO could be "wiped off the map."

The question is, why? The answer is complicated and involves everything from geopolitical interests to economic interests and international relations.

U.S.-Ukraine relations (U.S./U.S.R.)

When you think of the United States, you're likely to think of two things: the U.S. in the Cold War, and the world as we know it today. It's a lot easier to remember what has changed in that era but difficult to picture what it would take to get back to that time.

The Cold War brought with it a massive shift in the global balance of power, with a handful of powers gaining a hold on both major powers of the day: the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom all having some influence on the other.

U.S.-Russia relations haven't been quite so turbulent in their modern era -- although they clearly went through a rocky period under President Barack Obama's administration. (For many liberals, though, that's because of Ukraine.) But the U.S. relationship with Russia has, at various points, been either very tense or at least complicated (depending on the issue involved).

The U.S.-Soviet relationship was quite strained during the Cold War, and the two nations' borders had shifted several times. It's not exactly the era of the "peace dividend" (as it was portrayed at the time) where the United States enjoyed strong trade ties with nearly every nation and didn't require Russian energy imports.

One area where relations with Russia, though, did improve during the Cold War was in U.S.-Soviet space. The U.S. and the Soviet Union collaborated extensively, with both sides conducting joint space efforts, satellite launches and even joint research and development efforts during space race era. There was also an arms race between the two countries during the Cold War, which led to some Cold War concepts that continued to inform U.S. policy in the region. In particular, the U.S. Air Force-Soviet Union Strategic Defense Agreement of the 1950s is still commonly cited as one of the defining moments in the history of space warfare.

But the Cold War did end, and while the United States did end support for the Warsaw Pact when it ceased being a functioning political entity in 1991, it did not come to an end as clearly as one would expect it to. The two nation's relationship continued to shift, with the U.S. focusing more on cooperation with the countries of Eurasia, while the Soviet Union moved away from its ties to the former Soviet satellites and toward the former satellite states of the Soviet Union. Over time, Russia and the Soviet Union did begin to work more closely on international and other issues, but it's still complicated.

For the time being, the relationship between the U.S. and Russia has been based on economic interests. Russia has long been a crucial supplier of natural gas to most of Europe. It has a very large U.S.-Russian energy deal. Russia has also been a significant supplier of weapons, especially nuclear weapons.

The situation around Ukraine is complicated in that the region, particularly in terms of access to energy and weapons systems, were historically not so closely related: there is no natural gas pipeline going from Ukraine to the Balkans or the Black Sea, no military base near Crimea, and there's no NATO base next to Russia's borders in Kaliningrad.

Ukraine is the most obvious area where both sides benefit from this relationship -- as Ukraine is one of the leading markets for Russian natural gas, Russia could easily shift to supplying Ukraine with more of its gas -- and is also one of the best (if not only) energy markets for Russia's weapons industry.

On one hand, this is good for both Russia and the U.S. in a geopolitical way -- it is good for Europe to have access to energy and good for the United States to have access to weapons systems. Moreover, both countries have benefitted from this relationship in terms of trade. Russia has had the opportunity to diversify its natural gas exports (in which Western Europe has been a large part), while the United States has benefited by supplying military systems to both Russia and China.

But the situation also raises a very real question for why there has been such close interest between Russia and the United States, why there are many issues that can only be solved through this relationship.

Why has this relationship so clearly been so valuable to both sides?

First, there's the obvious economic relationship, with

As an "early adopter", NOAA has put its website through its paces and we've had a chance to explore some of NOAA's many new features.

The major areas of interest to meteorologists are the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and the Wide-Area Integrated Observing System (WAIS). The ABI will provide the US National Weather Service (NWS) with a much clearer view of how weather is changing throughout the country.

An animation of a NWS forecaster working the ABI shows how quickly what is happening across the country is being reflected in the ABI image.

I'm sure you don't want to read too much, but these are the numbers by county for the top 20 counties, as voted on November 8.

In the 2016 election, the exit poll was conducted by Edison Media Research. Each county had 2,000-10,000 sample ballots cast, and then the county's average was translated across all the precincts, with adjustments to make sure certain demographic groups did not skew the national vote.

There was a lot in the polls: gender, race, education level, income, political party preference, whether or not you lived in a swing state, how you voted in the primary, your past voting history (included in your address), whether you were registered to vote, age, and more. But for the purposes of this blog, here are some of the more interesting ones:


There are a couple of things that caught my eye.

The Democratic primary electorate skewed heavily towards Bernie Sanders, but his supporters voted in large numbers (60-65 percent in three counties). They were more likely to do so as the night proceeded; he carried them by a 5-point margin in Madison County at the beginning of the night, for example.

In most counties, Trump got more votes than Cruz; his biggest vote share was in Jefferson, where he won by a whopping 30 points — but there were far greater disparities between Cruz's and Trump's wins.

Overall, the countywide turnout, especially for candidates who received more than 15 percent of the primary vote, was more than what we would expect from just a typical election year.

Looking at exit poll results by county, some other patterns emerge:<|endoftext|>Tottenham have reportedly offered £26million to Leicester to sign Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez.

Leicester's squad was shaken by the news that their star duo could be leaving the King Power Stadium this summer and the French newspaper Le10 Sport claim Spurs have stepped in to bring in two of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, according to a statement on their official website.

Mahrez was identified two years before the start of the 2014/15 season by VfB Stuttgart executive team member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, as the Algerian international's career was beginning to stagnate after a slow start to his career in the Premier League.

Rummenigge has now reportedly approached Leicester's hierarchy with an offer for both strikers and the Premier League side have turned the offer down.

The 27-year-old Vardy, a former France Under-21 international and England international, signed for Leicester on a 12-month contract in June of the previous season and has already played a major role in helping Leicester remain in the top flight.

This season he has bagged 15 goals, having also contributed four assists, despite being left out of Leicester's league-winning team for their opening game of the Premier League season against Tottenham.

The U.S. State Department says the U.S. continues to call for the immediate release of all detainees detained in connection with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf made the comment in answering questions from Fox News reporters on Friday, while she was traveling in the Middle East with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

"We obviously are hopeful that these people will be able to go home. We do support that. We continue to call on the United Nations to press for that," she said.

Earlier this year, the U.N. General Assembly passed Resolution 1540, urging the international community to put the detainees into international institutions to ensure their security while they await trial. The resolution calls the Sept. 11 attacks an "international armed conflict" and not just an "act of terrorism," though Obama has repeatedly referred to his administration's handling of the case as a "wartime crime."

Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York ordered the government to turn over to the defense 12 of the 16 defendants in New York, New Jersey and Virginia who have been convicted of terrorism-related charges, giving prosecutors until Sept. 20 to determine how and when to release them.<|endoftext|>We've reached our weekly quota for guest blogging on the web. This means at least one post each week is going to be going on from one of our contributors. Check back later in the week for more guest blogging on web development with Ruby, including a look at the new RSpec web app.

How do you find clients? As someone who spends a great deal of time online, it comes naturally to me to search from the internet and use the search terms "Ruby on Rails" and "web dev."

This isn't a new idea by any stretch, but it's still quite fun to search for "client" – "developer" – "familiar" – "developer website" – and try to find the right name for your project.

I like to start my conversations with a question. "So, who would be an ideal client?"

It sounds straightforward, but I like to follow it up with a question of my own. "Okay… so how often are you going to get to work on a full development project of this scale?"

Once I find out the time that week, I can start creating a schedule or work in a specific way.

One of my most important clients is one of the best Rubyists I know. For most of the year, he is always working on big, complex projects. He also has a very particular client that helps pay for a great number of what he does.

It seems that my client has a large library full of different applications, frameworks, and libraries that he's building up and he would like to test how a full web app would work on both a slow laptop and a fast desktop.

What he does for fun

First, I need to gather up things and install a few utilities. I used to think of this as part of the Ruby world, but it seems to be much more accessible to the average person.

First, with Homebrew, install curl, wget, and mv:

$ brew update && brew install curl wget

You want to install some of these for testing.

Next, it is important to know how to use mv. I'm not going to get into too much detail – if you're familiar with Unix, the file names are all obvious.

$ mv README README.md $ open README.md (or README.md for some languages)

With the basics under our belt, let's check the client library. To make sure our test project doesn't break we're going to run this to get an error:

$ bundle exec rspec

This will output a lot of information, but if you look at the output in a text editor or the console you can copy each line and jump to it without having to look at the rest. If the line is blank, it means you haven't included it in the file – in that case you're good to go.

$ bundle exec rspec

======================================== SAMPLE 215 ========================================
There are many types of "natural" parenting. Each with their own benefits, pitfalls and challenges and each with its own set of circumstances. It is all about the child.

It is a fact that the best parent is the one whose actions help him or her become a better person and person capable of self-help.

It is true that being a parent is an extremely tough task and it requires a lot of effort and dedication.

It is true that there is no substitute for good parenting and, therefore, no substitute for good children. No, a single parent cannot replace a married or partnered couple and a multi-generational family with a toddler, toddler to toddler, toddler to teen, teen to parent, parent to child, and finally child to parent.

The above examples are just a sample of the type of situations that may arise in your life.

But there is an easier type of situation that exists:

Children and youth are there for you, always because you are still in the process of becoming a mature and independent person.

If you've ever lost a child due to an early intervention then you know what I am talking about.

You will have to deal with these feelings. They come from the depths of your soul and your heart will be affected.

When children or youth come into your life, they will make you grow every single one of your abilities and the love you have for the person they are.


The more experience, the more the love, the easier will be.

You will understand that the process of learning is much different from the child's, young or not (you can never understand that, it has been far beyond your knowledge) or the adult's and this will be the reason the experiences will be easier and less painful and difficult.

And, you will understand that the love will be there.

As a mother, it can be easy to forget that you are someone living on another planet where the sun isn't constant and that there are people with dreams and dreams of their own. The things that you cannot see with your eyes are always there.


That is why I am telling you today, as a mother, to always remember that you are important to those who come into your life.

There is no way to help the children who will come into your life if they know nothing about you. When they come into your life, they will need your guidance, your love, your support, your guidance, love, support and guidance.

It is important to always remember this, as it may turn into their reality.

We need to remember this, as it is the main reason why I decided to speak to you today.

Because I know how much you want to understand what life is like for those who have a child in their life. But who can help when you don't know that you know?

If you don't know what it's like to see your child at 12 or 14 or 15 or 16, then you can't help but feel guilty when your child is still a toddler, because he/she is not living in your world anymore.

This is the most uncomfortable and confusing thing ever, but it is the truth.

Sometimes it is easy to forget this truth because life is more exciting than the feelings you get after a child is born and is growing.

However, if you want to really understand your own humanity then you will understand that all human emotions are based on the situation we are in at that time in each instance.

It is up to you to learn how to handle each situation and to accept that each of us live in a world where there are ups, there are downs and sometimes there are problems. That is the truth.

There is no substitute for having a child in your life.

It doesn't matter if it is 10, 15 or 16.

The one thing you must always remember is that each time you get into contact with your child, that you are now living through the whole life of that one person.

Yes, this may be difficult but it will be worth every bit of it if you take the time to learn from your mistakes and know that your actions are for future generations more than that of your own.

In fact it will make you a more capable parent, one that is happier and more accepting. You will learn from your mistakes and become a better person each step of the way.<|endoftext|>I found this while doing a google images search.

The World War I Centennial Commemoration Committee announced Friday it has reached a tentative "agreement" with the National Park Service regarding a potential date for the final event: a July 4th, 2011 event. The World War I Centennial Commemoration Committee announced Friday it has reached a tentative "agreement" with the National Park Service regarding a potential date for the final event: a July 4th, 2011 event.

"As you all know, we intend to have a July 4th, 2011 ceremony to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme," the committee website says. "The National Park Service has accepted the committee's proposal and it has been submitted to the NPS. We believe it is the best compromise we can come to with them." The committee is expected to meet again Friday.

The proposal's official statement read: "Both the WW1 Centenary Commemoration Committee, and the National Park Service have reached a provisional agreement upon a final date for the proposed July 4th centenary commemorative event. Both sides are confident that an acceptable conclusion to this agreement will be forthcoming, and they will be announcing a new date once the committee has gathered sufficient support from the NPS. The Centenary Committee believes the time and location of the July 4th event are of great importance to its overall objectives, and that its successful completion represents a significant milestone in the organization's journey to 100 years of commemorating the Great War."

The committee's original draft on the July 4 plan has since been revised to include other important dates, including the end of World War II and the 100th anniversary of D-Day the following year.

"Our decision was a very deliberate one," the committee said. "With the agreement in place, we have taken an action we hoped will have a positive impact on our plans for the centenary year 2015. We hope that this agreement can help us in our efforts to ensure that our centenarians will be able to celebrate this centenary year on the ground, instead of in a museum or museum hall."

During the past decade, the July 4th event has been postponed or moved due to events such as Hurricane Katrina, as well as to the threat of terrorist attacks.

The 100-year anniversary of the Battle of the Somme was declared on October 4, 2014, but has never been officially commemorated. It was originally scheduled for July 6, 2015.<|endoftext|>A senior Iranian intelligence officer was assassinated today near Tehran's military academy, a senior Iranian general said, in another blow to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's efforts to show his support for traditional Iran.

Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a deputy head of the Army Staff, said the assassination appeared to be "an act of revenge" for Iran's support for Syria's opposition and its efforts to undermine Syrian President Bashar Assad. He said the motive for the killing was still unclear.

The killing may reflect Iran's growing frustration with Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has struggled to gain traction in the last three months of his re-election campaign. Last week, more than 60 young Iranians protesting against Mr. Ahmadinejad were arrested, with Iranian news media reporting that they were detained over their political activities.

"There is strong feeling on the ground that the government cannot remain popular with its people" because of its mismanagement of Mr. Ahmadinejad's policies, said Reza Marashi, who covers Iran for the National Iranian American Council in Washington.

Mr. Ahmadinejad last week accused an American diplomat of kidnapping and killing Mehdi Kazemeini, a well-known human rights activist and prominent politician who opposed the country's nuclear program. Mr. Kazemeini's son, Mehdi, was killed last week in a drive-by shooting.

While many Iranians remain upset over Mr. Kazemeini's killing, most believe the administration is trying to divert attention from the nuclear problems, said Mohsen Sazegara, who was a high-ranking Iranian official in the intelligence agency directorate when Mr. Kazemeini was killed.

"If you ask the same people, they will tell you that you can't go against the government on an issue like this," Mr. Sazegara said. "So [the killing is] a cover-up."

Mr. Hajizadeh said Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and its elite Qods troops were behind the attack. He said the attacker was in his mid-50s and was dressed like a gardener. The attacker was fatally wounded in the attack, he said.

A senior Iranian commander, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, said the suspect was wounded by a rocket, but that he remained in critical condition as of Sunday.

Mr. Hajizadeh said the killing was carried out at around 8:50 a.m. local time, an hour before Mr. Kazemeini's shooting. The attacker
======================================== SAMPLE 217 ========================================
A major focus in this blog is to explore the current state of free software licenses, to provide guidance on some important issues, and most importantly, to offer our views and ideas as to how these licenses are currently shaping the future of computing. In this post, we have taken a look at three of the most popular and notable free software licenses: licenses for the GNU operating system, Apache's Apache License (also known as Apache 2.0), and GPLv2.

This is our fourth in this series. Our views about the GNU operating system, the Apache 2.0 license, and the GPLv2 have been shared last time, with GPLv2 at the top of the list due to its popularity, importance, and the large number of licenses that are derived from it.

We believe these licenses are important for open source software projects at the moment. Our previous article in this series, which looks at the state of the Free and Open Source Software Definition (FOSSD), and also explains how FOSSD could be improved, can be found here.

Please note we're not trying to answer all the questions you may have about the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) license landscape. That's a lot of questions for everyone to take in and digest over time. What we want to demonstrate in this blog rather is that there are a range of people with vastly different perspectives and interests that are trying to find a workable way forward for open source software.

Why does FOSS matter?

For open source software projects, there are multiple reasons why a license is important: a license makes it possible for users of your source code to exercise the freedoms in the FOSSD, which means they're able to redistribute their modifications (usually the code itself) to others. A license ensures that the user has the ability to contribute to project maintainers and other contributors, even outside the confines of a single project. A license allows contributors to contribute to projects that may not otherwise have enough people willing to volunteer their time and knowledge.

A license also grants the developer the ability to share their work with others, including potentially allowing them to allow others to fork and modify the code. This allows other people to build upon and contribute to the project. Finally, a license may be mandatory under certain circumstances, so that users must agree to adhere to certain terms in order to use or improve the software.

Why is GPLv2 so controversial?

A lot of people in the free software community believe that the GPLv2 is not appropriate for free software projects, namely in the open source world. In a nutshell, critics point to two issues:

A requirement that licensees agree not to distribute their modifications outside the constraints of the license. This seems to contradict the idea of the license being a guarantee of freedom for all, as this seems like an unfair burden that could potentially put people who were otherwise willing to contribute at an unfair disadvantage. The requirement that copyright holders sign agreements that make it impossible for others to contribute to an open SOURCE project. These claims have various facets, and are hard to determine on a case by case basis, because in many cases the "terms of use" agreements may be ambiguous about what they actually mean.

Is there support for GPLv2 in the open source community?

It's definitely not a unanimous view amongst the community as to whether or not GPLv2 is appropriate. Many argue that a license with these kinds of rules is inappropriate for open source projects. As discussed previously we feel that a license like GPL is a good fit for open source when the license is properly drafted and used in a way that addresses issues like license compliance and security threats. However, some people have asked whether or not GPLv2 is a good fit for open source projects at all, on the basis that a majority of GPLv2 is optional and is not essential.

One argument against GPLv2 is that it makes it harder to contribute to a project and that other people are likely to see a better opportunity to contribute to a project that can use the extra help. Therefore, this argument goes, it's only natural that a "hobbyist" or "hacker" would be more inclined to use an open source project that can benefit them.

On the other hand, some people argue that licensing agreements can be easily rewritten to enable new participants to participate without harming the original contributors to a project. For example, we might consider that in any given project each contributor should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to contribute to open source software or not without having to sign a contract.

However, in a license like GPLv2, there is no way to rewrite the agreement, thus preventing this option: one must necessarily be a member of the project's leadership to use and contribute to the project, and any modifications are subject to the constraints of the license.

In this blog article, we want to show that both these arguments can be made. We argue
======================================== SAMPLE 218 ========================================
The World Bank is making a dramatic statement with a new report that reveals how low oil prices will affect countries all around the world. The report suggests that low prices are set to affect the global economy, and many of the countries with the lowest incomes are already dealing with severe economic problems. Oil prices remain low due to the supply and demand dynamic and the falling cost of fuel. For example, the price of gasoline in the U.S. fell nearly 30% in less than a week. Prices of oil are extremely volatile, and the IMF reported that as much as one-third of the oil price is subject to speculation driven by short-term supply and demand pressures.

The current level of production is not sustainable to sustain the market of low-cost energy sources that has developed over the last six decades, and there is a risk of an oil price shock causing oil demand to rise, in turn, causing oil prices to rise and making the global economy less resilient to shocks.

The cost of energy is determined by production costs, especially oil prices. This has the effect of creating a negative feedback loop between production and pricing, as additional demand for energy is limited due to low oil prices, but low prices reduce the supply of energy and therefore increase the cost of producing energy.

The IMF explained in a recent report called "Oil and Inequality, Global Inequality and the Financial Crisis" that the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated that between 2000 and 2010, the cost of oil in the U.S. fell from US$55 per barrel in 2000 to under US$40 last year. The World Bank estimates that the cost of oil fell by about 30% between 2000 and 2010, from roughly US$60 per barrel to below US$40 per barrel. The IMF estimated that the drop in the oil price from US$105 per barrel in 2005 to just below US$80 per barrel in 2010, was the largest in 30 years.

The Global Financial Crisis

This drastic drop in oil prices is directly connected to the financial crisis in 2008. In 2008, when oil prices were in the $100 per barrel range, the banking industry was able to use oil to stabilize banking and financial systems. They used debt instruments to buy assets in banks and on the financial sector, such as commercial banks, sovereign wealth funds, private equity companies, hedge funds, and more. This allowed the banks to maintain their liquidity and continue to operate. When oil prices reached about US$100 per barrel, bank profits skyrocketed, and financial crises ensued. When oil prices dropped to US$40 per barrel in mid-2009, financial crises began in many countries.

Oil is a volatile and highly cyclical commodity because oil prices are based on supply and demand dynamics. Oil is a supply-driven commodity, meaning there is less energy in the fuel once it has left the ground than there is when it is still just sitting on the ground. As demand for oil decreases, so does the amount of oil that can be sold. The result of this decrease is low prices: a downward spiral.

In the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the international community agreed that the oil price would have to be stabilized at a certain price. Many oil producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Nigeria, Canada, Venezuela, Ecuador, and other countries agreed to increase production in an effort to reach a price of US$100 per barrel. If oil prices were to remain at an acceptable level above $100 per barrel, it was agreed that the nations which produce the most oil would be forced to supply oil at US$100 per barrel, while nations who produce less would be forced to supply at US$60 per barrel or lower. The countries that agreed to cut production and to cut supply would be the countries with the lowest incomes, with the richest countries buying the oil at these low prices.

This plan was designed to stabilize prices and prevent a domino effect. However, as prices fell below $60 per barrel, there was a huge shortfall of supply for the oil markets. The only way for prices to stabilize at a sustainable level was to have demand increase. This could either occur through government policies such as tax breaks for oil producers, or through increased demand for oil from new countries like Russia.

The Global Financial Crisis and the Oil Shock

In response to low oil prices, countries around the world rushed to cut back on production to meet the demand of the United States. As a result of the global financial crisis and the falling cost of oil, there was a shortage of oil in the global economy — leading to major problems for countries in Latin America, Europe, North Africa and East Asia. In addition, most of these countries' governments had borrowed a great deal of the money to finance their infrastructure to move quickly through infrastructure modernization programs that were designed to create jobs. When oil prices fell below US$80 per barrel, these programs were threatened and delayed as the money lenders were unwilling to lend to countries that had

"There's nothing to fear," one of the group's founders, John Beauregard II, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

He is part of the American Security Council's Military Task Force at Camp Arifjan in Niger, where he is acting as a liaison with U.S. Special Operations forces, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Beauregard, 32, was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Christian missionaries.

He is the CEO of the military charity, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF).

Since his youth, Beauregard was interested in the military, according to an interview that he gave to Christianity Today in 2015.

"I think the military should be a service to all who serve it, and that I saw the Christian principles of the military and felt that all soldiers should be Christians," he said in the article.

In the same interview, Beauregard said that his main goal is to help the troops protect themselves after the recent election of Donald Trump.

When asked if he knew whether Trump had made "threats" to the Pentagon and the military, Beauregard said of Trump, "He was so bad, though. I was so scared for our military as to what he would do to our troops."

That interview took place shortly before the shooting in San Bernardino.

The military is part of America, and the president's job is to ensure that our military remains the finest in the world. I'm concerned that a president with such a weak judgment and temperament is about to take that place," Beauregard told the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in the wake of the shooting in San Bernardino.

But Beauregard's concerns seem to be largely unenforceable.

There is no law that states that you have to be an American to fight abroad.

"You don't have to be an American to be part of an international military task force," said Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, in an email to TheDCNF. "The American people have no legal standing to challenge their government if they volunteer, pay, and serve a mission abroad."

It is illegal for the U.S. government to "adopt, train, or equip any foreign 'national army' even if it is under U.S. command … although no law forbids it," he added.

There is no requirement that the troops be American, either, according to Aftergood.

"When it comes to 'templates' for how to recruit personnel, there are no U.S. military requirements for recruitment, except the requirement that the personnel be 'legal persons,' which means citizens, not aliens or U.S. nationals," he said.

According to the Military Religious Freedom Foundation website's website, the group's mission is "to advocate for military personnel who have been denied freedom of religious expression due to their military service and combat obligation."

"We seek to eliminate the discrimination and intimidation our government inflicts on military personnel because of their faith," that site says.

comments<|endoftext|>(CNN) A gunman reportedly wounded a California family at a grocery store before opening fire inside a community college classroom, police said Tuesday.

Authorities did not say what led them to believe that Chris Harper Mercer, 20, of Salisbury, North Carolina, killed eight people and wounded a dozen others Saturday afternoon in a rampage that ended with he being shot and killed by police.

But after a three-hour standoff with the gunman and a shootout in which police shot him and others, Santa Barbara authorities said they were considering all possible scenarios and suspects in the shooting.

"We do not know all possibilities," Police Chief Ken Pimlott told reporters. "It may be the case that this was a targeted and isolated incident, but it may be the case that he was on a mission of destruction."

"Right now we are not allowing for speculation," he added.

Police have arrested Mercer's roommate -- a 23-year-old female -- on a warrant out of Washington state, said Sgt. Ken Shaughnessy, a Santa Barbara Police Department

"The problem with what she says is she has been playing the victim card for years," Sanders said in a radio interview. "And I think a woman who goes to the media and starts talking like that has to be pretty high on the list of people who are sexist because that's what she is, she is a victim."

Sanders has not directly addressed a story filed Thursday by the Washington Business Journal in which three female female employees of his campaign said they were not hired as equal partners in the "Women for Bernie" group and "were not paid at the same amounts as men."

"I don't have any problem if one group has a certain number and another group doesn't," Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told the Vermont outlet. "But I don't believe that women and men should be doing it at the same level ... It is wrong."

Sanders said Thursday he has a "wonderful" working relationship with Hillary Clinton as he heads toward the Democratic primary in late June, even though his rival was his former presidential boss and the former Secretary of State's most public ally.

"Of course we get along, she was the first one to endorse us, and I've seen her become a very, very effective politician," Sanders added.<|endoftext|>New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner on Thursday dismissed questions raised by former Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), about voter rolls in New Hampshire being purged in New Hampshire.

"The New Hampshire Department of Justice told us that nothing they would be doing would alter the voting rolls from the way it is, or remove anything from the books from the way it is. So, to the extent he was alleging something like that, that's ludicrous. Nothing has changed as far as elections go in New Hampshire," Gardner said at the press conference.

The New Hampshire Democratic Party confirmed reports that the state has added voter registration forms for Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), because his supporters have failed to sign up.

"We have to be very careful about what information is provided to people who are registering because of a breach. That's always been part of our process," Gardner said.

On a press call Thursday, Gardner said there was no change in the state voter rolls.

"This is a process that has been ongoing for quite a while now and the Department of Justice has provided a lot of details on their side on when people will be affected. What they did is they updated the New Hampshire voter registration records in the state and that hasn't changed since we've seen this issue," Gardner said.

Gardner also said the secretary of state had not received any complaints from any voters regarding improper signatures on the voter registration application.

Last month, when a voter rolls purge list was released, Democratic presidential contender, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, called on Gov. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and GOP presidential candidate, billionaire Donald Trump to release their own lists of voters purged from the rolls, saying they should release any names removed by their jurisdictions.

O'Malley released a list of voters who he said were wrongly purged from New Hampshire's voter rolls in 2012.

Sanders is the former democratic candidate challenging the primary winner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

Sanders has been criticized throughout the presidential race for his stance on voting registration. He said last month he supports same-day registration but has said he wants the government to do more if states are removing voters from voter rolls.<|endoftext|>The following are excerpts from Richard Seymour's new book, "Killing the Buddha."

To anyone accustomed to reading only one biography of a leader, Richard Seymour's "Killing the Buddha" will seem overwhelming: a work for the general reader. But in fact, Seymour's book is an unusually compact and meticulously researched study of Bhutan's monarchy, complete with numerous anecdotes from the emperor, royal princesses and members of the royal family, as well as the king's personal entourage.

For example, one chapter recounts how a royal delegation of 14, including two princesses, toured the United States in July. The delegation's main aim, Seymour writes, was to "educate themselves about their people's culture" and their "American society, politics and politics of the past." They visited Washington, D.C., Disneyland, the White House, and Washington, D.C.-area colleges and universities, visiting, among others, Harvard University. The delegation included a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old girl, and a young prince who accompanied the princesses (he was so impressed with his role in the royal family that he would become a soldier).

While Seymour describes the young prince's attendance in the "white-robe-clad" delegation as "a striking, rare occurrence," this is not the story of the royal delegation of 14. It was, in fact, the only

The EU has warned Athens that it will withhold aid if it does not comply with the agreement and has told Athens to submit a reform programme by next Saturday (April 13) if it wants the bailout.

After five years of austerity, the EU is demanding drastic reforms, including the privatisation of state properties.

An Athens newspaper, Kathimerini, reported in an editorial on Friday that the finance ministry's finance ministry had already started preparing for the possibility of an economic collapse if the government went over the fiscal rules and gave up its reform plans.

"If Greece does not deliver, the financial consequences may be more severe than people believe," Deputy Finance Minister Dimitris Mardas said in comments to the daily. "We have an emergency plan for this."

On Wednesday, the government told the European Commission that it would be hard to comply with its reform deadline if it had to lay off hundreds of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of workers.

The comments will raise concern at the European Commission, after it threatened the government last week against dragging its feet on the bailout deal.

"If Greece gets to the brink and has to implement the EU's bailout plan in the way it has said it wants it to, then it would force some businesses to relocate to another EU country," one of the banks' senior managers said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"At the moment, there are a lot of companies and banks in the Netherlands and France. If they start to lay people off it will push others north," the banker said.<|endoftext|>If you're a business man or woman who has made much of your career on the backs of people, it's time to stop. At last, a new study by researchers at the University of Queensland has broken down what drives people to use our services, so we as bosses can make an informed decision about how to reward them.

"Our findings indicate that people feel that their performance reflects their skills rather than how much time they were willing to pay for it, and that, despite the 'free for all', there are economic limits to how much of a person's effort they are willing to pay for," says study leader Prof Mike Sandfield-Smith.

"Our findings suggest that this willingness to pay is related to the extent to which a person enjoys the time they are spending with us."

It's a surprising result. Most businesses understand that they can't charge people for everything they provide. But the Queensland team's findings may have implications for the way we run our businesses.

For example, perhaps there's a market for businesses that offer "personalised" services such as "personalised advice" and "personalised service". Those services would obviously have a premium attached to them.

Perhaps that's because a person's spending time with a business is so valuable for many reasons.

In this case, the person is willing to pay for a higher level of service – perhaps they'll even pay more than someone willing to visit them – but they enjoy it.

A final note. This is just one view. Different people value different things and will value their time differently.

The study also looked at the relationship between time spent and pay, and found it's "very complex" and "complex relationships" with different groups make an impact. It will be interesting to see if these are also the results in other regions of the world.

Tough Love is an American TV series that focuses its attention on six different families who have been living together on an island in the Mississippi River. These families include four black families, two white families with members who have been living with their children for four years, and a mixed black-white family.

For the past week, all the families have been taking turns living on the island with a family member — a stranger or family member who is either gay or straight.

The show was filmed in August 2015, and was released on CBS on March 31, 2016, by network's studio, CBS Television Studios.

Cast (In alphabetical order):

The theme song to the series was recorded by Ben Folds.

Production

The production of the series began in 2015, and was based in Houston, Texas. The show ran on CBS for eight episodes, with the final two being shot in Atlanta, Georgia (between February and March of 2016). The show was filmed by Blackstone Pictures, in Atlanta. The cast and crew for the series were predominately Black people, despite the fact that all six families were white-owned. Although many Black people auditioned for the roles of each family, none of the actors for the show portrayed any members of the Black communities.

The storyline of the show was primarily centered on the theme of family. However, the show also addressed issues such as racism, discrimination and violence, and included the lives of some transgender people. Other topics addressed included homophobia, abuse, and mental illness.

History

The producers and executives behind the show made sure that it was culturally sensitive. The show was a pilot of sorts for Black-ish, ABC's freshman sitcom starring comedian Tracee Ellis Ross (the original series was canceled after only nine episodes). At the time, it was not clear if Ross would ever film an hour-long show or if the series would go on any longer than six scripts. In any case, the six families were chosen from more than a hundred families who met in a church in Houston after the initial series was shot. However, the show's creator, Kenya Barris, revealed that Black-ish would not include any of the families that originally had been chosen for the show.

The show's first four episodes aired between March 1, 2015, and March 31, 2015. The first episode, "The New Mommy," focused on an African-American family with two children. The second episode, "Settler Girl," featured a mixed-race family from Mississippi in their second year of marriage. The third episode, "House Party," tackled various issues including homophobia and racism, and featured some of the show's main characters, including the Black mother who is struggling with her children at home as well as some of her relatives. The fourth episode, "The Family Tree," covered a group of gay families and featured the Black father, played by George Wendt.

The final episode, "Hollywood," featured two white and two Black couples, respectively, in a white suburban home in suburban Atlanta. In these episodes, the characters addressed various issues that were central to other episodes of the series, like the recent shooting at a black church, as well as the difficulties of being gay or lesbian.

Despite its black-centered premise, the show did not have any predominantly black actors in leadership positions on the show during its run. However, a few were hired to produce the show.

The show received positive reviews, and received two Primetime Emmy award nominations, for Outstanding Comedy Series in its first season and Outstanding Drama Series in its second season. Each season aired between February 19, 2016, and April 16, 2016, and aired in the timeslot following the regular broadcast of the NFL.

"I feel really good in the group that we have right now," said Head Coach Ben Olsen. "Everyone's working hard, and we have a lot of young players that have an opportunity for playing time."

The roster, which features four Homegrown Players, is comprised of five players who are all Homegrown Players and three players that were acquired through trades in the 2015 MLS SuperDraft. United will also bring the most experienced roster of the two-game series to Red Bull Arena for the first time in D.C. United history. New York has not played at RFK Stadium in more than a decade, dating back to May 8, 2001, when the club became the first expansion team in MLS history to make its home debut against Columbus at RFK.

"That's very strange," said Svetlana. "Did any of them ever say anything about a black cloud that the sky was falling on the city? Because from what I remember, they usually described that as just a storm. What is this weird black cloud?"

"Nothin' weird, Miss," said the man in the black cape, who had been standing next to her. "It's an asteroid, and it's headed here towards Earth. It's already on a collision course, but if it's not stopped by now, it'll slam into Earth and split off into two separate pieces, one that'll hit the Earth and the other one that won't. That one won't be as big, though, and won't be enough to cause as big an environmental disaster. It'll hit Earth when it's about a half a mile across. But that won't mean too much, because no one's gone out and put a big enough telescope out there to pick up the pieces."

"Okay, well, what's the problem with that?"

"If that asteroid hits Earth, we're going to miss Earth by, you know, twenty-fifty million miles."

"Well, what's Earth?" asked the woman, looking for a clue in the dark clouds of clouds.

"That's not what that meteor looked like," said Bill, "That's not what an asteroid looks like, that's what a comet looks like. Look at that little chunk here in the middle, that's not an asteroid. That's a comet. It's made up of three things: hydrogen, carbon, and ice. It didn't come from anywhere at all. Not from any planet, not from any star, not from any nebula."

"Bill, wait, wait, wait," said the woman. "Bill, that's just it. That's like a picture of a comet being drawn in a book or something."

"The last thing on Earth that you know that that's not just another comet in a book."

"Bill, what am I gonna do with this?"

"You're gonna burn it, Miss."

"You're talking to a girl just like me," he said. "I don't wanna burn my own books."

"But we need to burn those books, because they're not just a picture of a comet, they're a picture of a comet on fire?" the woman said.

"Yeah, yeah, burn it anyway. Just burn it and be done with it. Nothing to worry about."

"Okay, Bill, okay," she said. "Just remember, you said they didn't want to know about what Earth was like, didn't want to know about why the book was on fire, so they don't wanna know about what Earth is like."

"Miss Svetlana," said Bill in the morning light, "we've already burned about half of those books, and not one of them is a picture of a comet on fire. Just… just… burn it!"

She stood up and pulled her hood over her head, then went outside and burned the books herself. "Yes, Bill!" she said. "We have nothing to worry about!"

"Miss Svetlana, could you please tell me where I can get some ice-cream?" said Bill, going back inside and putting ice cream on his sandwich.

"Ummm… I'm not doing well."

The lady came back inside and got out of the car for a minute. "You know, Bill," she said, looking at Bill, "I've been wondering all day. Is this the same place where you always buy your ice-cream? Is it another one of your favorite places? Is it my favorite place?"

"Oh, no, dear," said Bill.

"It's a favorite place, dear! Why not have some ice-cream here?"

He looked down. "Actually, Miss, it's not ice-cream. I've just had breakfast. I'm here to talk to you about your book."

"Oh! My books?" she asked. "I thought you were the one who was reading them or…or… or…"

"I'll get them," he said.

"Oh, thank goodness!" she exclaimed. "I didn't think I had a chance!"

"Are you gonna help me with this?" he asked, holding out the letter from the woman.

"Of course, dear, but first you'll have to do something else. Oh! Here." She handed him the envelope.

Boeing has been awarded two $25 million contracts to help build the next wave of long-range strike submarines.

A deal with Australia's Irving Shipbuilding in St. Augustine, Florida, worth $7.65 billion, includes the design, commissioning and long-lead materials for one of the lead sections.

The contract also includes up to $1 billion in work that could be performed at any of the United States Navy's seven submarines yards.

"The work will ensure the capability to build the next generation of strategic submarines at the same time as we modernize our existing fleet," said Navy Secretary Ray Mabus at a ceremony at the Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia on Wednesday.

Irving agreed to build two Ohio-class submarines at a new facility in Virginia with a capital investment of $8.6 billion.

"The company is an exciting and well-qualified partner," Mabus said. "Their proven management team is building high-end shipyards."

Under construction

The Navy's future nuclear aircraft carrier fleet will require 12 Virginia-class submarines, a smaller number than the current 25-27 boats but significantly more than the eight submarines needed when the USS Independence class was retired in 2010.

The next 12 submarines will have a total construction cost of about $18 billion -- roughly $3.7 billion every time one is built -- more than double the current $10 billion cost of a Trident submarine.

The navy plans to build six submarines under construction in Maine at the yards of Huntington Ingalls, Bath Iron Works, Bath Iron Works and General Dynamics.

But to keep that pace up, the Navy will eventually have to build 12 submarines at a time, increasing the cost of construction almost 10-fold.

"This is part of the way to do it," said Mabus.

Congress also approved $7.75 billion to build two USS George Washington aircraft carriers at the yards at Newport News.

The carriers are a key part of the Navy's future and are designed to patrol the world's oceans for nuclear ballistic submarines, anti-submarine and surface warfare aircraft and the command's aircraft carriers.

The Navy estimated the first George Washington could be commissioned by late 2015.<|endoftext|>Welcome to the 2016 BCS National Championship Preview for all you college football fans!

The College Football Playoff is a long, long, long time coming, and while the NCAA has given us some hints to its possible plans in the short-term — a four-team playoff beginning in 2016 (with a five-team one to follow) — it's unlikely that we're going to get a definitive ruling on the matter until the early fall of 2017.

Until then, we'll just have to wait and see what the committee decides to do. For now, we have a few ideas on where they could go if they decided to add another game to the 2016 bowl season.

The Orange

As much as we'd love to see the committee end its postseason ban and play some "national championship" games, it's going to be a much easier sell if the committee's goal is not to keep track of everyone from Oklahoma to Iowa over the course of a two-week stretch. After all, it'd be a waste of time and money for the committee to watch the same programs multiple times.

So, there's little reason for the committee to include another game than the obvious one: Clemson in the semifinal. With the Orange out of the College Football Playoff, the committee could have the Clemson-Arizona semifinal on their docket. Or, you might not see one at all.

The Big Ten

While the ACC had its share of issues in the first round of the playoff, it was the Big Ten that managed to make itself look worse than ever in Round One. That being said, the committee could still do a lot better on the whole.

So, where do these schools fall in the Big Ten's bucket? Sure, Iowa's a potential title contender, but the same could be said about Michigan State and Penn State. Minnesota doesn't have the most wins (7 to 9) but they were one of the surprise teams this season. Ohio State had their struggles in 2016. Michigan and Michigan State are the team's that had the worst seasons on the field.

Still, the committee probably doesn't want to spend time putting a team that's barely good enough to qualify for the postseason through a bracket of teams that have won five bowl games, including one in which they went down to double overtime in front of the home crowd (Wisconsin at Madison).

The Big 12

While the Big 12 is in some sense the Big Ten's little brother, the committee still could do worse than to add Baylor and TCU to the pool of playoff teams. Oklahoma has been the most dominant team of the past decade — maybe of the last decade — and the committee won't want to watch it lose to TCU if it

I had to give it a try myself. I have a lot of good friends living in the Twin Cities and we enjoy our annual Thanksgiving feast. We don't do it so much as we enjoy the tradition of it. The first time I cooked and sat down to a meal as a child, it was a special day and I was not afraid to experiment with different foods. I loved what I did when I lived in Michigan. However I never knew what was coming until my son became interested and he tried some of the foods I grew up on.

When it comes to Thanksgiving this year I thought I would try a vegetarian/vegan version of traditional Thanksgiving meals. So a lot of recipes have a veggie layer on top. I used spinach, tomatoes and broccoli. When I was making them I used my favorite homemade tomato sauce (makes it vegan and gluten free) and brown rice. I know we do make Thanksgiving vegetables that aren't always in the mainstream.

This tofu scramble has lots of veggies but no meat in it. While it has tons of flavor, it is a bit hard to find a store bought tofu. If you can't find it, then my homemade "Finn" style tofu will do (I call it the "Finn" because the best part is the consistency). You can mix the dry ingredients, then cook it. I love getting a little extra moisture and flavor without using egg replacer or milk.

Here is the recipe I used (for those of you who don't want to read a recipe):

Vegan Thumbprint Stir Fry

Tofu Sauce Ingredients:

3 cups veggie broth

1 medium yellow onion, diced

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped

5 oz. firm tofu, sliced or chopped

1 tsp sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

5 cups cooked brown rice

Bowl Ingredients:

Vegan Worcestershire sauce

2 Tbsp peanut butter

Vegan Parmesan cheese

Directions:

Season and set aside the remaining vegetable broth.

Place the tofu on a tray or plate and place in the refrigerator. If the tofu has been sitting in a dark place in the fridge for at least 8 hours, it will defrost.

Remove the tofu from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 225 degrees.

Put a large pot on the stove and add the broth.

Add all the garlic and onion and cook until soft.

Add the onions to the pot along with the tofu. Add the tomato puree, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and peanut butter. Bring to a boil.

Lower the heat a little bit and cook for 5 minutes.

Add the brown rice and cook and stir for 2-3 minutes.

Add a little more salt and continue to cook for about 1-2 minutes.

Serve and enjoy!

A large beluga whale is breaching in Lake Tahoe, and it may have gotten caught in a fishing net.

The video posted by the Pacifica Wildlife Institute on its Webcam Wednesday shows the massive sperm whale going past the shoreline while some people walk nearby. Then the whale appears next to a couple standing on their back deck and the water starts to break. The whale breaks through the second-story railing and splashes the water, startling the people on the deck.

"We think a fisherman just got caught while trolling a boat, which is really dangerous," said Pacifica Wildlife Institute president Dave Ewing to ABC affiliate KGPE in Reno.

A spokesperson for the North Lake Tahoe Animal Care and Control Center said a fisherman "had his vessel overturned around 4 p.m. while trolling along the shoreline. A large female beluga whale came into the water to join the troller on its back deck. This whale was feeding the troller. After feeding the whale did the troller stop fishing? The adult female became agitated and turned to follow the troller back deck."

"Troller catches huge whale while fishing," TMZ.com reports.

The beluga was taken to a nearby hospital in "satisfied state" before being released unharmed.

"There are some people who are interested in seeing whales, including the beluga whale," Ewing said. "It is one of these animals we have to watch and learn over time. This whale was caught when a fishing vessel was caught in the line."

It's not clear how the fishing net caught the whale, but the area is an active fishery in the area.

"They've seen a lot of these whales this year," the spokesperson for the North Lake Tahoe Animal Care and Control Center said. "They'll go

For the first time in history, the US Environmental Protection Agency has set out a concrete plan for cutting carbon emissions, by 2020 at the latest. This may seem counterintuitive – after all, it may look as though we are already well on our way towards meeting the goal of keeping warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius, defined as a 'safe' warming limit. But according to the US EPA, the US' greenhouse gas emissions will not stabilize until 2021, and will hit an all-time high by 2030.

But how to fix what's broken in the fossil fuel industries is one question. The larger question is: how to make our energy system more sustainable long term? The United States is already in deep trouble for climate change and air quality, and the nation has already committed to a course of fossil-fuel extraction, shipping and burning that will make the challenge even harder later on. However, the solution depends on the policies and technology driving our current energy consumption.

So what kind of technology could we use to tackle climate change? What would be better for a country with a history of air pollution, and a nation that now burns more coal, gas and oil than ever before?

Climate change

The challenge of climate change, including extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and fires, is inextricably tied to human activity. Climate scientists believe that more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels as opposed to using less fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and humans have a lot of it in their bodies, whether it's in the air we breathe, in the water we drink, or in the food we eat. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, and this warming impacts the entire globe.

Fossil fuels and coal have been used since the beginning of time. But it wasn't until the industrial development of the 19th century that they were harnessed into the industrial structures that allow us to manufacture everything from TVs and refrigerators, to cars and airplanes and all manner of other products. When humans use fossil fuel resources, there are two ways that this happens: in the form of an energy source as part of a process like manufacturing a car, building a house or moving a country, or, in the form of a waste product. By burning an energy source, we make a product that has an energy cost. By using fossil fuel energy, we make a waste product. We can choose which kind we want to use. In this case, we decide to burn oil, coal or natural gas to move around a country. We're also using fossil fuel energy to build the houses, buildings and structures for which we're so proud. These are the primary ways that we use fossil fuel energy.

In addition, fossil fuel energy also contributes to climate change because some of it's the waste products from the energy-producing process – such as sulphur, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Because they produce heat during their combustion, emissions that are produced are called 'GHGs' – or greenhouse gases. We emit these emissions from our heating and cooking systems, and from the factories where our cars, homes and manufacturing machinery are made. They also contain some of the greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.

According to the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions have increased by over 40% over the last decade, to around 1 trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year. The vast majority of that increase is from fossil fuel use and deforestation. It's only by tackling the source of emissions, burning fossil fuels or reducing carbon emissions that our climate will stay within safe limits.

A world of clean energy

To deal with climate change, we have only two options: we can build new technologies – such as clean energy technologies and fossil fuel-free renewable energy sources – to replace energy resources that have a high carbon footprint, or we can replace energy with energy waste from dirty energy sources.

A report published this year states that the energy sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dioxide globally. That's why the global climate summit in Paris should aim to achieve a global energy system that is at least as sustainable as the one that exists today.

For a country with a fossil fuel past and a strong energy economy to deal with climate change, energy and climate policies must take into account the scale of our current energy consumption, and the technology it uses. We have yet to see adequate energy policy policies worldwide for the clean energy technologies and clean vehicles it will take to decarbonise our energy system. And there's plenty of evidence that policies that favour fossil fuels will make things even more difficult in the years to come, as we struggle to bring coal and oil production costs into the current low cost range.

A few weeks ago, when you walked into the grocery store or the supermarket you saw a small table with a variety of delicious fruits and veggies, right by the produce section was a sign that read "no animals were used in its creation," as a way of showing customers that the produce is truly free from animal suffering. It is a very interesting initiative where people from all walks of life came together to provide our natural ingredients.

In our food technology evolution we have made strides since the 60s and 70s. It is hard for us nowadays to relate to animals suffering, it is all about technology and our ability to make plants do our bidding. To make the fruits and vegetables that can be sold on supermarket shelves we start with the seeds that is grown in an enclosed space using a variety of different methods. This takes up to a couple of weeks making sure that you can eat these fruits in a short period of time. There are other things that we need to focus on and in this episode of The Vegan Experience you will discover them all.

Here's the speech:

And here's the tweet that captured a moment that I loved so much:

Bernie Sanders just called Hillary @HillaryClinton to congratulate her on tonight's speech. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/gQVqeoB4F0 — David Wright (@politicalwire) October 14, 2015

Bernie Sanders just called Hillary Clinton to congratulate her on tonight's speech. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/p7N5oEq3Rj — David Wright (@politicalwire) October 14, 2015

I'm old enough that I remember Hillary "giving a call to service speech" back in 1993. The idea — that a strong leader can inspire and energize not only yourself but your people — has been with me for a long time. Of course, those in my generation, for whom Hillary Clinton has been a hero, will recall the 2008 campaign in which she delivered her famous speech saying that she was in the race not to be president but to "break a glass ceiling." That was a defining moment for the women's movement of that era.

It's time for Bernie to step up. It's time for him to do what he's never done before and show some leadership and inspire America's young people. And so today, on behalf of those of us that have been paying attention, I urge you, Bernie Sanders, to finally do the right thing. The last thing the country needs is a candidate who simply ignores the issues facing youth, while pretending that what's happening in the world today isn't a major issue, particularly for young people growing up in this country. The last thing this country needs is a candidate who has to appeal to older Americans, people in senior states, even those who do not live here. You can never win with 50-point margins anymore. You can't win with a 2 percentage point lead at the end. It's time for him to step up.

To be sure, a lot of the problems that I want to talk about are still happening today. We have one of the highest unemployment rates for our young people today, and we're going to have much, much higher unemployment in the future. I don't think it's just you, Bernie. People in all of our states are working so hard and still don't have enough money to pay their bills and put food in the table. We have problems with poverty and homelessness and the need to raise wages. We still have a long way to go, but the changes we need to see are coming. And I truly think that the American people, whether or not they want to vote for you, understand what our country needs right now, but they are not going to vote for somebody who dismisses these issues.

That was a call to service. We can never give up now. We need a new generation of leaders. We need someone who has come into politics with real experience — Hillary Clinton did — and she got out there and took on the big fights that many thought not only impossible but impossible to win. I love that about you, Bernie. I love that about you. You've been there. You've worked to make it happen. You've made your neighbors work, made people in the White House work, so that in the end, you can give them their shot. I'm not sure you can do it again, so I want to ask you now to help us start

This article needs a big cleanup.

More importantly, there is a lot of information wrong in this, and it doesn't make much sense in the context I'm trying to provide.

To make an issue more clear, let's discuss the issue, and then the issues that come up afterwards.

The problem here could be made clearer if we rewrote this into a statement that was more specific:

// The problem: the code does not handle the type of a function declaration, // so it gets stuck in undefined mode. The problem is that // it is just a method, and it is called with this._decl. return function declare () { if (this.isFunctionDecl) return this.method; if(this.getFunctionDeclaration()) this.getFunctionDeclaration().bind(this); };

Then the reader can better understand what happened.

The principal of Cesar Chavez High School in Riverside, Calif., demanded that Jonathan Garcia shake the junior's hand, a policy that was never challenged, the plaintiff claims on behalf of himself and his family. "This incident violated (Garcia's) 14th Amendment right to due process," according to the lawsuit."


The 15-year-old student, who is gay, was suspended for four days in June. In November, the school board fired Garcia, after he filed a grievance.

The school board "failed to consider Jonathan's First Amendment right to free speech and the principle that public schools have to adhere to the Constitution," the lawsuit states. The board, he says, "failed to consider Jonathan's right to equality under the law."

The school board says the teacher's conduct did not result from "bias," according to the district's statement.

One reason for using things is convenience, but convenience has cost: people lose valuable productivity from having to keep up with a messy workspace. Here's a list of some of the more common reasons to get rid of things:

1. "Clean" is not "clean anymore"

This sentiment applies to just about anything. The feeling that "I'm finally getting rid of that messy desk" usually doesn't extend for computers. Computers are always a mess. They smell like cigarettes, people spill things on them, etc. That's because it's a technology, and a technology is made with humans in mind.

2. "Now I can move to the cloud"

Moving stuff to the cloud is more appealing because it has the benefits of being portable and easy to move, but it costs you even more. You'll also get more time and less work for just the cost of paying a monthly fee or purchasing a service.<|endoftext|>Crowdfunding is taking off. Over the past few years, the number of projects for sale on Indiegogo has more than doubled, and the number of projects on Kickstarter has grown by a factor of 2, meaning that crowdfunding is becoming the new source of capital for startups.

It's a fantastic and exciting time to be an entrepreneur. But for me, the real potential lies in the next level: a platform that makes it easy for aspiring entrepreneurs to connect and build upon their business ideas.

I've been thinking more and more about this for quite some time now, and I have a few ideas that I believe will help make it very easy both for startups and individuals to get funded, share their ideas and build a community of support around them.

Here's how I think about Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and what I believe will improve them if applied:

Kickstarter

Kickstarter has the ability to give the world a new way to fund projects, and it can be great for businesses both big and small. It is especially important to give smaller brands an opportunity to get off the ground, and to do it quickly.

So where does Kickstarter fit in this picture? Well, if you are a business, you've probably noticed that all businesses need crowdfunding to survive. If you are a startup, you have been told, and so have I, that you need enough capital so that you can start.

There's many ways that you can start building up your business in any way that you can imagine. It may be a blog, it may be a website, it may be an online store, it may

The world of social media has a name for people who lie to, stalk or bully others online. But one of these people was born and raised in a town on Newfoundland's west coast:

He was a "social media molester?"

That's how local police described the suspect in the case of a 14-year-old Newfoundland girl who went missing in December.

He's been described in the media as a teenager — his own parents say he was almost 24 — who is also transgender.

Police said he's now in custody and will face a charge of first-degree murder.

He won't be named to protect relatives of Kristine Mihevc, the girl's mother, which the Crown is calling a privilege.

"I just felt like the media was overblowing this, and I didn't want the media overblowing her, that this is not the situation," Cindy Mihevc told CBC News.

Her son is missing, she says, and police are "worried" the public is seeing the family as something they aren't.

The boy's name isn't being released because, he's just a 14-year-old that's not supposed to even be alive. It's just the name that's leaked, and they don't want to be labeled the suspect or the bad guys. — Cindy Mihevc, Kristine's dad

"If he's a suspect, so be it, it's all information that the police have at this time, but we're not going after him, we don't want this to be a witch-hunt situation," Mihevc said.

"There is no reason to jump to any conclusion."

In other jurisdictions, including Canada and United States, journalists, advocacy groups and legal and media experts have called for restrictions to the privacy of the identities of those arrested for crimes, and of those who are missing or who are suspects in a crime.

They've also advocated for strict media guidelines, in line with guidelines for police investigations and investigations involving minors.

A 'glamour picture'

Mihevc, however, disagrees.

"He won't be named to protect his grandmother, who is the victim. She didn't give us his name, there's no legal protection for her, so we don't want to name anyone," she said. "We're not the bad guys anymore."

Cindy Mihevc tells CBC News Kristine Mihevc is devastated by the news her son is missing in New Brunswick. (CBC)

"As far as public perception and as far as my reputation is concerned, all we want is to be left alone."

Mihevc insists the man in custody is not a predator, or at any time been in Kristine's home.

"We're not the bad guys anymore."

The boy will be transferred to the New Brunswick Child and Family Services Program, where he, "without his parents," is under the jurisdiction of the New Brunswick Child and Family Services Act, which applies to people under 18, and applies to all New Brunswick institutions.

Kristine Mihevc says she does not believe her son was kidnapped, but the publicity surrounding his disappearance has been tough. (CBC)

'The world is changing'

Kristine Mihevc told CBC News she would rather be talking about what happened to her daughter, not who is responsible.

In an interview for her latest documentary, titled My Son — My Son: A True Story, Mihevc said the world is changing in terms of children and young adults who do things online.

But it is also changing in many areas, not just for the transgender community, she said, but for the general public.

"I hope you all understand the world is changing, it's really, really changing, and the world is not a nice place and I hope that you have enough tolerance to say please, let's leave the kids alone, let's let people speak out, you're not necessarily going to be the bad guy. You're not going to be the bad guy."

A new study commissioned by the state found the annual state investment in shore restoration between 2016 and 2021 will be $2 billion for the Eastern New York Region's three counties: Suffolk, Nassau, and Westchester.

According to a press release, the report found New York State's investment is based on current and projected water quality values. The release says current assessments indicate an "

A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft released the Edge browser, an extension of its web browser that works on Windows 10 computers with a touch screen. You can download it in the Windows Store for free.

Microsoft claims that Edge is better than Chrome for Windows 10, but it's not the first browser to be upgraded in this way. Microsoft's own Edge browser, which doesn't include web extensions, was released in the fall of 2015, before Chrome was even a twinkle in Google's eye, and we know exactly how much Chrome improved over the years.

But what if we're not talking about the next version of Chrome, or Firefox for Windows? What if we're talking about a different browser with the WebExtensions API? That's what we're going to talk about today, and see which one offers better performance in a less-used aspect of the browser, speed testing and benchmarking.

It's worth noting that all three browsers have different features and performance issues that affect web browsing performance, and each one has a different feature set that can enhance speed. But this is how we'd compare them, and it should serve as a baseline.

Speed Testing

I recently spent some time benchmarking various browsers on Geekbench 3. I ran five runs on different PCs, and calculated the average, with some deviation for better context.

Here's the original Geekbench 3 performance graph.

The graphs below show the difference in scores. For each run, I also compared it against the Chrome Browser, Firefox, and Edge, because I use all of them for my day-to-day browsing. Also note that Edge uses the WebExtension API to enable speed tests.

For the Speed tests, I tested the browser using Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Chrome

Edge

Firefox

Edge and Firefox have identical performance.

Chrome has a higher score from the browser.

Firefox has a higher score from the browser.

Edge and Firefox actually have identical performance.

Firefox and Edge have identical performance for the speed test.

Edge performs below Firefox for the speed test.

Edge and Firefox have identical performance for the speed test.

Firefox and Edge have similar speed test scores for both the web and flash benchmarks.

Firefox and Edge have identical WebExtensions API scores for both the web and flash benchmarks.

Firefox and Edge have identical speed test scores for the web and flash benchmarks.

Edge and Firefox perform similarly if we exclude the Flash benchmark results, which we didn't.

Both Firefox and Edge have identical scores for the web-only Benchmark, both score about the same for the flash benchmark.

The Flash performance is the highest out of all the browsers that I've used in this test.

It's a slight improvement above how each of them compare to the last generation (Chrome) of Chrome, and the current version (Edge).

The WebExtension API is an important part of the next iteration of Chrome, which is said to bring faster web browsing in Chrome for Windows 10.

Firefox and Edge

For speed testing, I tested Firefox and Edge. Here's what those versions look like.

As you can see, they are identical. So, what's the point? Is that the difference, and does it matter? Is it the reason to use each of those two browsers to the exclusion of the others? Let's see.

Firefox uses WebExtensions in Chrome, so it performs better.

Edge does not support WebExtensions and uses its own extension system, so it does not perform better than Firefox.

Chrome runs faster because it has some of the best JavaScript, the ability to render JavaScript inside WebExtensions, and the ability to optimize all JavaScript execution. All three browsers run at least one benchmark on Geekbench, except for Edge. Edge was able to do the single-core test with 4 threads, something Chrome cannot do.

Edge runs faster with WebExtensions because they make it faster.

If you want to run the benchmarks yourself on Windows 10, here's the files with everything you will need.

All of these benchmarks are free for download. But the benchmarks that I include are generally the best that Microsoft has to offer. That means that the performance will be better in this case, not necessarily the best.

Edge Benchmark

WebExtension Benchmark

These three are the most important benchmarks and they are the only ones that I run on my test machines. The reason for this is that all the other browser benchmarks are very subjective, and will not give a real-world answer.

However, one thing is clear about them. When you look at them one by one, you can see that they are all significantly better than the other browsers.

Edge is still the fastest for browsing. This is still the

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, thereby maintaining the current extraordinary monetary policy stance.


The Committee reaffirmed that economic conditions have considerably improved since the Committee met in December. Gross domestic product expanded at a solid annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter over the first, and real economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than the initial reading. On balance, the Committee now expects that economic activity will expand at a fairly steady pace, supported by rising household spending and business fixed investment. The Committee expects inflation to rise to its 2 percent objective over a medium-term period, supported by the stronger pace of economic growth and a lessening in the labor market pressures that have been weighing on inflation. Inflation expectations have risen appreciably over most of the present economic cycle.


At this meeting, the Committee was struck by considerable heterogeneity in its views about the outlook for the labor market and inflation. At this meeting the Committee reiterated that it expects an increase in the average pace of unemployment over coming quarters, with no immediate change in the overall unemployment rate. The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will remain on a path close to 2 percent, which would be consistent with its goal of maximum employment.


A number of participants raised the possibility that inflation could rise above the Committee's longer-run objective in the near term due to factors that are difficult to identify, such as temporary factors that have contributed to the recent improvement in employment, or some combination of factors that is unlikely to become transitory. Some participants indicated that, in light of both these and other factors, they would like to see the longer-run inflation objective become more accommodative. Others noted that, in the short run, there were also considerable concerns about longer-run inflation expectations. The Committee views the risk of inflation running below 2 percent as being low. The Committee expects this risk to be offset to some extent by the Committee's expectation of further progress toward achieving its inflation goals.

The Committee also reaffirmed its views about the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee chose to remain actively engaged in monitoring inflation developments in order to ensure that inflation remains at a level that is both likely to be consistent with its dual mandate and, to the extent possible, also promotes strong economic results. Given that inflation has declined slowly since peaking in late 2014 and recent improvements in labor market conditions are modest by historical standards, the Committee is likely to continue to evaluate inflation developments carefully in light of its dual mandate. In light of these considerations, the Committee chose to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent. At this meeting, participants agreed that the appropriate stance of monetary policy remains accommodative at this time.

In deciding how to proceed, the Committee noted that economic conditions have improved further since the asset purchases were first initiated in October and that employment continued to expand strongly in recent months. While inflation has risen only slowly since the end of 2014, the Committee now expects inflation to move back toward its longer-run objective over the medium term (see "Information for Policy Decisions—Information for Policymakers"). This increase in inflation expectations has also contributed to a somewhat

In 2013, a new video clip emerged of Barack Obama discussing Iran's nuclear program during one of his speeches. The footage had not been seen before and is now raising questions of what the president knew about his nation's intentions before taking office, and when.

The video, which was published on November 4, 2013, by YouTube user 'Al-Muhajiroun', appears to show both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden discussing a deal with Iran. In the video, you can hear the president say, "I was going to take what is a bad deal, and I was going to turn it around." And then, "If we solve the problem we're in a pretty good position. I would rather see this than see it get worse."

The Vice President and Obama then discuss a list of demands from Iran to settle the nuclear crisis. These include:

A termination of all missile activities and the destruction of the Quds Force (an Iranian special forces unit within the military), along with the return of Iranian hostages in the United States.

The removal of sanctions.

The release of American prisoners being held in Iran.

Bipartisan support from the international community.

An end to U.S. sanctions

The following is a transcript of what the video said to be Obama's words on the matter, as it was published:

The American people made me this president. I accept the mandate to bring change. I have always believed we could make a better deal. I am going to work with Congress to make the best deal that we can. But I recognize all the hard work ahead of us. Every day, we're going to spend some effort trying to improve the overall deal. But in order to make progress, we've got to be able to get all sides agreeing to what has to be done. So if by some small stretch of the imagination, the status quo was better, then I guess I'd accept that.

You can listen to the video here:

During the campaign, some pundits doubted the authenticity or context of what Obama said. "If this tape doesn't prove that the White House has been keeping an eye on its Iranian partner, then it doesn't prove it at all. But given the fact that the White House released the video before Obama himself gave his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, which was also recorded by the group, there's just no telling the scope of information that has been compiled on the president's contacts with Iran's government."

The White House has yet to release official footage of the video. The next day, November 5th, Obama said he would "wait and see" what the footage looks like and whether it proves any wrongdoing.

While Obama could say that he believes the deal is the "best possible deal" for America, the man is also the Commander-in-Chief of its armed forces. In order to keep America safe, it is crucial that the United States is able to act in concert with other nations. America should not use its military capabilities to get what it likes in the Middle East.

The video comes at a sensitive time in the campaign. Recent polls suggest that Republican challenger Mitt Romney is closing in on Obama's lead.

President Obama and Joe Biden may have revealed some details of Iran's nuclear program, but they did not reveal the secret of what Iran has actually done. If they have done this, it is only because they are unable to control the Iran's government. America cannot allow Iran to become a nuclear power.

This new committee will examine the extent to which the ecological impacts that resulted from the Deepwater Horizon spill impacted coastal economies throughout the Gulf of Mexico on a local, regional, and national level. The panel also will address the state's regulatory response to the spill's impact on the Gulf's ecosystems. More than 1,100 scientists from the public and private sectors, academic institutions, and federal agencies from 38 states and the District of Columbia responded to the agency's requests for their scientific input. The panel includes scientists from both coasts, in both North and South America, as well as scientists from other countries. The panel's work will contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The new panel will meet weekly for more than a year to review the panel's findings. The meeting schedule, which will go into effect immediately and will be published in the Federal Register, will be posted in each panel's web site. "The public needs a clear and accurate understanding of why the Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred, and how the federal government responded to it," said Mark Hartung, senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. "The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service cannot investigate the effects of the explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig without an independent science panel that provides scientists in every region of the country with accurate information about why and how the spill occurred." For more than three months, the Center for Biological Diversity has been collecting and analyzing publicly available information about the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, documenting, mapping, and visualizing the Gulf's oil spread and damage. The Center has also been reporting damage to birds and fish, and has produced video, graphics, and maps that illustrate how oil and gas are polluting the Gulf's seas, rivers, and beaches and harming migratory bird and fish populations. These maps, videos, and photographs are available at www.biologicaldiversity.org; on Twitter @biologicaldiversity and @cbiendanger; on Facebook .

The United States may be a far cry from the Utopian society envisioned by American novelist Aldous Huxley or the utopia envisioned by William Gibson, but the country can also boast plenty of examples of utopian communities. Whether in the New England towns that attracted pioneers and made the nation's first permanent settlement in 1620, the early years of the American frontier in the late 1700s and early 1800s or some of the larger cities, the American utopias that have lived on are mostly the products of the American quest for freedom, individualism and social harmony.

The most famous and influential of these was created during the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. It was the New Albion settlement in the Connecticut Valley, a community based on hard work, the pursuit of personal glory, and self-reliance rather than government regulation. The settlement was founded by an English immigrant named Edmund Calvert and comprised many of his followers, including his son, John. The colony's motto was: "Peace, plenty, and good will to all." Although the colony was not successful in its first year's effort to establish order, the English government eventually granted the colonies their right to secede from the United Kingdom, and in 1645, after much controversy, the colony declared independence from the British Empire. They soon expanded outward to the other colonies, creating the American colonies. Today, New England, New York and most of New Jersey also include communities that are modeled in part after New Albion.

Utopian city-states and towns around the world

The first significant utopian city-state was founded by Dutch Huguenots in 1581, in what is today Belgium. But only 100 residents lived there. This town, today known by its unofficial name of Koppenden, was part of a communal society where peasants worked together on farms, shops, offices, and churches. The Huguenots founded the city-state of Flanders, located in central and south-eastern Belgium, in the early 16th century. The town soon grew to include 40,000 members. The town was ruled by the "general council," an assembly of 10 to 12 families who were chosen from one another, with the mayor and the three members of the local village council chosen from among their families. It was also the site of important religious events, such as weddings. A new social order called "Jubilee" developed in Koppenden after the defeat of the Spanish Armada during World War I. The Jubilee was similar to New Albion's communal self-government, where all households were equal and could elect their own chief and council. After the end of World War II, Koppenden fell apart with the end of the Dutch monarchy. Today, the town is known for its old buildings and its traditional way of life.

The second major utopian city-state was founded by the Puritans in the Puritan settlement of Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1630. During the reign of King Philip II of Spain, the colony was invaded and lost a large part of its settlers' goods, which were confiscated to help finance the colonial war. The colony's leaders resolved to establish their own economy without government interference, and to provide all residents with a living in 1635. Their first step was to establish a government-administered economy and to provide a town meeting for each household. The towns and villages were then organized into ten townships, each consisting of three villages and a church, each with its own chief, council, and sheriff. Each town had a justice of the peace and a police force. The Plymouth Colony, as it became known, was the model for other cities, townships, villages, and colonies beginning in the 1640s and 1640s. Today, its ruins sit on the rugged Boston Plain in the northeastern part of Massachusetts.<|endoftext|>I have seen many articles that explain how to "use your iPhone or iPad a more creative way." It doesn't take very very long before they reveal their most interesting point; that one can use an iPhone or iPad to create a virtual "tablet" for use as a "tablet" in the real world. To me, this is more work than just using the iPad in a real environment because not only do I have to get up. The display must also be set up for a real room rather than a small room. There is also the inconvenience of keeping the iPad in a case. I don't feel there is anything more creative than just using an iPad. I don't have to constantly remember to turn it back on, and I don't have to bring along an actual tablet. The iPad is a fully functional touchscreen in the real world.

One of my best inventions has been using my iPad in a work environment as a real-world display. I have been known to use it under a table or table top and it works great! I will say that in the past I have used an iPhone or iPad as a display in my office, not my real office.

The American Enterprise Institute has announced it will spend $15,000 on the reelection campaign of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. According to the institute, Walker is "a bold, pro-life conservative who has fought for jobs and the middle class" and a "reformer who has fought for the best public policy for Wisconsin." The $15,000 spending is the largest ever by the group. The Wisconsin Jobs and Economy Association was asked for the money by Walker's re-election campaign, but was rejected.

Walker is one of the top politicians in America who's been working to take on the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and other anti-worker, pro-corporate lobbies. The American people, not ALEC, deserve a governor who will fight for their freedom, not a lobbyist who'll turn the state into a corporate plantation.

Since Walker's election in 2011 ALEC has been on fire. With a new member this year to the board, ALEC is working to pass so-called "Stand Your Ground" laws that would permit and promote the use of deadly and deadly force against people who just try to escape an assault. This is what ALEC did in Wisconsin in April of 2012 when Scott Walker was governor. ALEC passed a bill to allow businesses to have the right to use deadly force to protect themselves and employees when confronted by a criminal who was involved in some criminal activity. ALEC also supported the voter ID laws the Governor signed for the November elections.

Walker's support for ALEC's political agenda has put him in the "right wing" spotlight. Many news outlets have used phrases such as Walker the Tea Party-style Republican, Walker the Evangelical-style Christian, Walker a Republican Party-style politician and even Walker, the "Republican of the Badger State." This last is particularly true given Walker's anti-union, anti-worker and pro-business agenda. Walker has called for the creation of "American Jobs Corps" which is a federal program to hire teachers, administrators and workers to take their place in state and local school systems.

Walker's Wisconsin Jobs and Economy Association (WJA) is the latest recipient of the AEI's "big bucks" in Wisconsin politics. The new member of the Wisconsin Jobs and Economy Committee, which is a sub-committee of AEI, is Wisconsin's AFL-CIO and the Wisconsin Council on Domestic Issues, which represents major corporations. The two groups had been meeting, and Walker's own State Senate Republican leader, Rep. Chris Kapenga from Appleton, had proposed to the state Democratic Party that unions would be replaced in the party by WJC member groups. But Kapenga withdrew his plan to the GOP.

Walker and WJC also support the "Freedom to Work" bill which would allow for companies to negotiate with employees who choose to work at another employer. The proposal is being promoted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) which has worked to undermine unions all over the country. Walker and WJC have given money to ALEC over the years as well and WJC has also endorsed Walker's recall election and the 2014 Senate elections as well. It is worth noting that when Walker vetoed an income tax hike, he used an ALEC-written economic growth plan from the Heritage Foundation, and Wisconsin was ranked number one in job creation in the nation under Walker's economic growth plan.

Walker also worked closely with ALEC's "Stand Your Ground" Act, a law pushed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch, that gives the right of individuals to use deadly force in self-defense even when that force is illegal. ALEC has a lobbyist on the Wisconsin state Senate, Rep. Joel Kleefisch, who also represents the oil, gas and mining industries. "Stand Your Ground" has been very helpful for the Koch brothers as they have pushed numerous ALEC-written bills since 2010.

According to the Huffington Post, WJC had $5 million in the bank as of August 2012 and the AEI had $13 million in the bank. In a statement from the Walker camp this week WJC said they have contributed to the governor's campaign because of his anti-union positions. According to the organization's website, the organization "is working on a number of fronts to advance and promote Walker for governor, and to ensure that Wisconsin remains a beacon of opportunity to all who live here" and that it "is currently raising money in support of these efforts." The Wisconsin Jobs and Economy Association also says it works "to bring Wisconsin businesses, policymakers and educators together on important questions of the day, as well as promote Wisconsin to national and international leaders in industry and business."

American Enterprise Institute is no stranger to using corporate subsidies for special interest groups. For example, in August a federal judge ruled that the Koch-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) has broken ethics laws by using tax-exempt organizations to promote their right and special interest agenda when discussing public policy.

"This was the first case of its kind for our organization," said Michael Grebe, ALEC's Executive
======================================== SAMPLE 236 ========================================
A new study from the Pew Research Center and the Annenberg Public Policy Center finds a majority of Americans now support the legalization of marijuana — a trend that's been in place, in some form, since 1991.

Support for legalizing marijuana reached the highest point in Pew's polling since Gallup began asking the question in 1973, with 51 percent of the country now either in favor of the idea or somewhat supportive it.

As recently as 1990, fewer than half of Americans support legalizing it.

"The legalization of marijuana is no longer a fringe trend," John Della Volpe, the head of the Annenberg Center, said, "it's now among the mainstream."

That shift marks a substantial change in national views on cannabis. But the report doesn't offer what the marijuana industry would describe as the "breakthrough" that's long been the goal of pot-legalization advocates, which has involved changing public opinion through direct lobbying efforts, political action committees, and ballot initiatives that have garnered support from several states.

It appears legalization proponents have already surpassed their goals for 2014, though. On Election Day, support for recreational legalization in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia was about 80 percent.

Despite the legalization push, the survey found that Americans are still far less supportive of the drug than other segments of society: only about a third think it should be legal, according to the poll. Americans are more likely to say they drink alcohol legally than to think it's okay to drink cannabis.<|endoftext|>The first thing to notice is the color—a vibrant blue and orange.

Here's what the top looks like.

On the back of the box, it says, "One side is silver, the other is black. The metal sides are coated in gold."

The gold "side" seems very shiny, like a mirror. And it's very noticeable that there's a hole in the bottom where it fits around the battery. It's also noticeable that I can see the little white stripe, but I'm not sure I actually see it.

The power button is on the left, and the volume rocker is on the right. Both of them are also metallic and smooth.

Here's the back.

Here are the little holes that the battery attaches to.

The plastic is still super thin.

Also pretty thin, but not so thin that it's translucent

The micro USB connector is not on the back, as we saw a bit ago on the LG G Pad 8.0.

The SIM card slot is on the left, the microSD slot and phone charger hole on the right.

Here's the back of the phone.

Let's do the phone now.

You can see the little "Door Closes" screen. You really get a sense of how thin this thing really is.

You'll notice that the battery in here is very large.

Here are the two speaker grills, with the microphone hole (the one we saw on the Galaxy S4, and the small one on the Nexus 5) attached.

I'm guessing that Google is using the same materials that they use on the case for this phone.

Here are the bottom buttons:

You'll notice that the back is a little more rounded.

And now the backside.

A lot better.

There's a big hole in the middle here. The headphone jack is on the bottom.

And a small, square opening at the top. This is the charging port.

Also, the battery cover is the same silver metal that was on the Nexus 5, which also had the headphone jack (or should that be the speaker?).

It's very interesting to be able to take a look at the software. There are a lot of little things that make this phone different.

The Nexus 5 was one of those phones that was super simple. It used the HTC Sense software with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. But it was still very similar to other Android phones out there, right down to the launcher and lock screens.

If you were one of those who just wanted a really simple phone, the Nexus 5 offered you that. But if you wanted to customize it, like those who prefer Samsung TouchWiz (like myself), then the "nexus devices" weren't for you.

Google Now was the exception. There's actually a lot to like in Google Now, which is why people liked LG's One (and even HTC's One Max).

The Nexus 5, on the other hand, has a lot of options. It's not just your standard Android, either. Google's got the "Now on Tap" feature that lets you use voice interactions and information like location data to suggest things, and it's all in the Google Now layer. The search box lets you pull up the web when called for.

Her comments came after the province decided this week to make a new highway construction process mandatory for all projects, even those in the planning and design phase.

She made the announcement before the B.C. Lions took on the Calgary Stampeders in a pre-season game at B.C. Place on Saturday, and said the public should know what will happen before any construction starts.

"We're going to make sure we've taken measures to make sure the public knows what's going on, because in the design phase these decisions are very difficult and decisions that shouldn't be made as they're being studied but once they're being designed, they have to be made," Clark said.

'This process has been out there for so long'

B.C.'s Transportation Ministry announced earlier this week that all projects under $100 million will have to go through an open and rigorous process where contractors have the opportunity to challenge their own estimates.

That includes determining whether they can afford to build the road – or if the proposed cost is high or too low.

It has been more than a decade since the province's first government study said it would be best to have the public involved before any project was underway.

"We're doing a lot of research on that, and we're very serious about that. Because while I think it's important, it's very challenging to do it right," said Clark.

"We have to be transparent and accountable. And so we're going to give this process a couple of years and then after that we will put in place a system that we can make changes to as we will see fit."

'We're just going to go ahead'

When asked about criticisms from the construction industry that a new process would be difficult and costly, Clark said the government had no need for the industry in the first place.

"We are investing to build a better province," she said. "We're just going to go ahead, and they'll go ahead to make those decisions."

B.C.'s Construction Association Executive Director Mike Devereux said his organization was not consulted in the province's decision.

"The last thing we need is a new process that will be a long time coming for a sector that depends on this country for 80,000-plus jobs every single year, and we need to ensure the new process is done right," he told Power & Politics.<|endoftext|>The most effective way to avoid and treat anxiety is through mindfulness meditation. A study released by Stanford's Center on Longevity and the Behavioral Insights Team finds that mindfulness, when combined with behavioral therapy, can actually help relieve anxiety.

"Mindfulness is the deliberate, focused awareness of present thoughts, emotions, sensations, and bodily sensations," said the study's lead author, James S. Levine, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychology at Stanford. "Mindfulness practices provide a foundation of understanding about the nature of anxiety and how it works."

He and colleagues from the Stanford Behavioral Insights Team measured participants' cortisol responses as they engaged in anxiety management training as part of their research. They found that mindfulness-based cognitive interventions helped reduce people's stress and anxiety levels.

"One of the surprising things that we realized as the research unfolded was that there were multiple mechanisms at play that helped sustain people's resilience when confronted with stressful events," he said. "We saw that when people were able to engage the right parts of their brain, their stress and anxiety levels dropped."

In a paper about the research, published in JAMA Psychiatry, authors from Stanford, the University of Washington and the Norwegian Institute of Health and Rehabilitation Research found that people who had mindfulness training experienced a decrease in negative moods, an increase in positive mood, and greater improvement in anxiety symptoms than those who did not receive training.

Mindfulness, the researchers said, involves cultivating an awareness of one's thoughts, feelings, and sensations and regulating them in a way that facilitates insight into one's life and the situations in which they arise. It typically involves the deliberate awareness of thoughts and feelings and the ability to observe and respond to them.

Mindfulness training is being found to be most effective when conducted through a supportive relationship between an individual and a trained therapist in the form of mindful awareness meditation. That is, during meditation, individuals are taught to focus their attention on feelings and thoughts without trying to change them, and are instructed to observe those thoughts and feelings, identify when they are distressing, and then simply observe them as the thought processes occur.

"Our research suggests that mindfulness mindfulness training can help people who have had anxiety disorders or chronic pain or other physical condition that disrupts their health to regain greater resilience and control of those problems," Levine said. "We think that people who have these physical conditions can benefit

MUNICH, Germany—In a move that stunned the business world, Volkswagen said on Sunday it would start selling a smaller, more fuel-efficient diesel-powered version of its popular Passat compact sedan in the U.S. next year, bringing the first American car built for the country's growing market to a stopgap, stop-gap model even as the wider Passat will remain available.

The executive order was intended to give the State Department an additional month to decide whether to resume issuing visas to nationals of those nations, according to the U.S. official. It does not apply to those from the four Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan -- temporarily lifted from the list of banned countries by President Donald Trump in January.

The move represents the third time the U.S. has blocked visas for nationals from the four countries — North Korea, Venezuela, Somalia or Sudan — as Trump has sought to tighten security measures and punish countries and individuals who his administration believes pose a risk to the U.S.

A U.S. official familiar with the matter said the directive is "part of the plan to tighten up vetting policies on who we're allowing in." Trump signed two executive orders on Jan. 27, temporarily banning all Syrian refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, along with Iraq, and restricting travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

[The latest: Trump, CIA brief on Syria]

"It's going to be a problem for the next six months and we need to know in advance if any people we're letting in are going to pose any threats to the U.S.," a senior U.S. official said.

Trump, who campaigned on an "America first" platform, is not personally involved in the visa matter, as the official said. Trump is relying on his top national security officials to review visa issuances for countries, including Cuba, that have been identified as posing the highest risk. Trump has expressed concern that members of his administration are being drawn into an issue that is largely outside their purview.

Asked whether Trump has directed senior national security officials to review visa issuances on countries identified as posing the greatest terrorist threat, the White House did not comment.

"We will continue to prioritize countries and individuals that we think we can more effectively vet and prevent terrorist activities before they can even come here," said a senior White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk publicly about a subject beyond that of public commentary.

The U.S. official said the review, currently led by Vice President Mike Pence, was being spearheaded by Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert. Their report is due on March 15 and will have to consider the threat of individuals who have traveled to the countries or have lived there for extended periods.

"This is one of the most important reports to the president because it'll be the first time the president has any objective data on the people who are coming in from those countries," the official said.

A senior congressional staffer familiar with visa matters said that the Trump administration is asking for a 10-month delay in processing visa applications. That request has been denied by the State Department, a congressional aide said, but "they would be able to request to have their application expedited if they want in order to give them more time to make sure they are not the next target for terrorists like Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 and wounded more than 30 in November 2013 in a shooting at Fort Hood in Texas."

"If it turns out we are giving them the same exact amount of time that other countries have in the past," the congressional staffer said, "it may not be worth it."

Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the committee that oversees the State Department, said he "cannot recall a previous instance when the State Department extended a visa waiver application by more than 100 days with such significant security concerns as identified in the Executive Order."

"As concerns the executive order, it is important to note that the executive order does not grant preferential treatment or approval under the Visa Waiver Program," the agency said. "As with all visa applicants, there is an extensive application and visa adjudication process."

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the departments involved have the authority to decide whether to waive a country's visa ban, but he also said that the administration needed "to have a better handle" on where it was going to get its information and on the level of vetting the country would be able to provide.

Dive Brief:

With one week remaining before a federal court hears arguments in its ongoing case to invalidate Seattle's $15 minimum wage mandate, a coalition of businesses is pledging to fight any ruling of its own.

The Restaurants Industrial Council, led by the National Restaurant Association, Seattle's largest business organization, is set to file a lawsuit Friday against the City of Seattle on behalf of a dozen restaurants and delivery services.

The companies, which include Papa John's, Chick-fil-A, Qdoba Mexican Grill, Red Robin and Starbucks, say they are losing millions of dollars to minimum wage hikes and would face a flood of customers from employees that would replace them, Bloomberg reports.

Dive Insight:

The Restaurant Industrial Council group represents some of the biggest national restaurant chains and is led by the National Restaurant Association, the industry's largest lobbying group.

Since the City Council approved a measure in 2014 raising the city's minimum wage to $15, leading to the lawsuit, at least three lawsuits have been filed by individual businesses: one was brought earlier this month by Subway and another by Zappos, and the last suit was filed by a group of small, independent restaurants in March.

These lawsuits, along with the pending federal case, are expected to be decided by the U.S. District Court judge Robert S. Rucker, who is presiding over the federal lawsuits and also hearing arguments on whether the City Council mandate that businesses pay workers $15 an hour is allowed under state law.<|endoftext|>1.

Our first look at Polaris 10 from MSI in a card that doesn't come with a reference cooler has already been well received. We were impressed with the price / performance potential and the fact that this is essentially a small form factor RX 480. Since this isn't a reference design, MSI has taken a different approach to cooling with their own version of the popular Twin Frozr cooler.

We now find ourselves in the position of seeing the new MSI Radeon RX 480 and the GTX 1060, both of which have a reference cooler at the same pricing, but AMD have a slightly different cooler design for RX 480.

The new GPU features a Twin Frozr V cooler with a single 120mm fan that's flanked by a pair of massive 6-pin power connectors. This looks a lot like the RX 480 reference cooler, but we find that the two extra heatpipes are mounted onto the card in an upside down fashion (and not only are the two small vertical fins of the Twin Frozr V upside down, it's really the whole backside of the cooling solution). This will of course produce some increased temperatures with the fan on it's highest setting, but the rest of the card will remain cooler overall.

At 4.6Ghz, AMD claim this is a higher clock speed than the reference clock speed of 2.6Ghz. We are of course testing this at stock settings as we want to see how that clocks up the RX 480 at a later date or if it can deliver the higher clocks.

This card features a pair of 8-pin connectors along with a pair of 6-pin power connectors. We will be using the dual power connectors for all our power related testing.

There were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the two groups, with significant differences between groups and between subjects occurring at the 10 and 30 minute marks (p < .05). The mean mean age of the study participants was 15.8 years (standard deviation [sd] = 4.0) with an average IQ of 88.8 (sd = 13.5), indicating that cognitive functions measured showed a normal distribution. There were no significant differences in reading comprehension between the two groups (p > .05), and no difference in verbal IQ between both groups (p > .05). There were no significant differences in memory for digit sequences in either the control or the intervention groups (p > .05), and no difference in working memory or reasoning (p > .05) between the groups.

Results: There were no significant differences in general academic achievement between the two groups (p > .05), and no difference in IQ between the two groups (p > .05). None of the demographic variables of interest (gender, ethnicity, family background, education level, previous learning) differed in any other significant way between the two groups. However, there were some interesting differences in the cognitive skills affected by either of the interventions. It was noted that the intervention group scored higher with the test of working memory, which is considered to be the most important memory function, as well as with the verbal tests in reading comprehension than the control group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in IQ.

Context:

This study was conducted to determine the effects of learning one of five cognitive skills in an introductory psychology course. The study was initiated around the time the course began. Each student was randomly assigned to a separate intervention group consisting of reading comprehension (reading to children), learning to use and write, problem solving, logical reasoning, and working memory (working memory). The intervention groups were randomized to receive one of four different materials to take home.

Participants:

This study took place between August and September of 2014 at the University of Pennsylvania. Approximately 60 students were recruited through postings in the student newspaper. There were no significant differences in age, educational level, number of years in the school, or family background between participants. Participants were all from the Philadelphia area. The sample was balanced for age, gender, ethnicity, and family background. This was also controlled by a student sample size of 48.

Main Outcome Questions:

The primary focus of this study was to compare performance on the five different types of tests assessed by the course, and to compare the cognitive effects of one of three interventions. Participants were divided into two groups based on cognitive function in the course (in reading comprehension, working memory, and logical reasoning) and received all five tests.

Primary Outcome:

We determined the extent to which participants demonstrated increased test performance as measured by both reading comprehension and working memory (by using a standardized and valid test of these skills as the primary indicator of cognitive function). We did not include vocabulary or reading comprehension in this measure because these types were the most obvious signs of general cognitive ability in the course. The main measure we used was verbal IQ (IQ). We used an IQ score at each test to determine the range of ability, and then we divided the scores into IQ quartiles. The IQ score could not range more than 20, so we determined the group using the largest IQ quartile.

Secondary Outcome:

We included the measure of vocabulary (verbal IQ and vocabulary) because it is a measure of general cognitive ability rather than a measure of specifically a particular cognitive function (like reading comprehension).

Results:

The intervention group performed significantly better on each test in both reading (e.g., 4.08 vs. 3.94 on the reading comprehension test) and working memory (e.g., 1.75 vs. 1.65 on the working memory task) than the control group. There were no significant differences in terms of reading comprehension IQ at 10 and 30 minutes. The intervention group had greater verbal IQ scores than the control group at 10 and 30 minutes (p < .05), but the intervention group had less working memory scores than the control group at 10 and 30 minutes (p = .05). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding logical reasoning at 10 and 30 minutes. Finally, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding working memory IQ at 10 and 30 minutes (p > .05).

Conclusions: This study showed that learning to use and write a list of three words from one of five subjects at 15 to

Luxury & Design Luxo, one of the leading manufacturers of premium automotive accessories, introduces a new luxury sedan for 2015. The "Elegance" sedan will offer enhanced comfort and enhanced driving performance with its elegant, premium design and distinctive interior and exterior features and quality-driven production capability. The sedan will deliver a comfortable, relaxed ride and will be priced at an affordable price-point that is competitive with the competition and is set to be welcomed by European luxury car buyers.


Exterior Design

The "Elegance" sedan is an elegant, modern interpretation of the premium sedan class and will be offered in 3 models: the sedan with the best balance between sportiness and luxuriousness, a hatchback with more performance and refinement than the sedan, and an SUV. The four-door model will be one of the first SUVs in Luxo's new family of vehicles, in which the brand has taken the lead.


The sedan's exterior reflects Luxo's unique and exclusive look and will be offered in three unique combinations: front and rear fascias and chrome side steps, along with chrome accent bars. A full-sized boot designed to store the 4.2L V8 engine and all the additional equipment to be carried on board including the automatic transmission, the front passenger seat and rear passenger seat are also carried over, so that the passenger can easily unload the equipment at any time and return to his seat to enjoy his time in traffic. Additionally, the luxury seats are equipped with a comfortable, integrated head rest, while the rear passenger seat has a padded back.

Powerful Engine

The "Elegance" sedan's 4.2L V8 engine, which is equipped with the new 7-speed dual-clutch automatic to offer faster and more precise gear changes than in the standard 2.0 V6, can drive the car at up to 250km/h (155 mph) with all the necessary safety and convenience features. The engine's power is sufficient for driving from 0 to 100km/h (62mph), with the engine's torque reaching a maximum of 380Nm (250 lb-ft) and maximum speed of 300km/h (186mph), for a total driving range up to 260km. The car also comes equipped with a standard electric-assisted manual gearbox in the automatic transmission.


Sedans with "Elegance" Design

The sedan includes the following upgrades throughout its design: new headrest with high-gloss finish, new rear bench-style seat front with two-tone stitching, new rear seat upholstery with premium quality fabrics in a choice of colors, new rear window with new chrome accent bars, high-gloss door mirrors, and new front grille surround with chrome accents, with additional colors in the options list. All these visual touches, together with a more muscular look and a unique combination of luxury and performance, will help the new Luxo sedan to build its position at the highest levels of the premium sedan class.


Engine

The new 4.2L V8 engine, which includes a new direct-injection system, utilizes a unique high-performance cylinder head and crankshaft with cylinder banks of 19 valves, coupled with a unique power train that allows for an outstanding power delivery from low to mid-motor RPM. The engine delivers a smooth engine note as well as an extended power band. Its power peak of 455Nm (257 lb-ft) comes at 8,000rpm and its torque peak at 2,200rpm. This power and torque are delivered well-controlled for maximum efficiency and excellent handling, while the engine is fully compatible with many of the European safety technologies, such as the Electronic Stability Program, Electronic Brake Distribution and the EBD.


Exterior Design Design

The sedan's interior will be designed with Luxo's philosophy of luxurious, sophisticated and sophisticated. A number of luxurious elements - including a headrest with high gloss finish and a center armrest with matching stainless steel trim - form the new Luxo interior, which complements the luxury exterior design. Interior quality is provided by Lexus' world-class manufacturing, which is complemented by premium materials that include premium leather with a color matched contrasting stitching, a two-tone center console, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, leather door panel inserts and a leather-wrapped steering wheel knob.


"In this year's introduction of the Elegance, Luxo's aim is to bring its unique brand identity to the market, starting with the Elegance sedan and taking these brand strengths around the world into the luxury car series - with the intention of reaching customers in every continent, and giving them a true pleasure of living." Luxo Brand Ambassador, Pierre Faucher


Production

LX.T, the new division designed to support Luxo in the production of premium cars, will be headquartered in Luxembourg with three production sites in China. An existing production facility was

An image of the original sign made from the original photograph of the sign

On May 23, 1869 Charles William Wilson wrote a letter to the editor of the Times of London, describing the discovery of an astonishingly large stone building, "an immense block of red brick, and, in comparison with its size, almost nothing, or, rather, nothing remarkable," within the confines of New York State's State Thicket. The newspaper ran a story about the strange building, with the headline "A Great Giant's City," a striking illustration depicting an oversized pyramid. Within a year the story was published in the New York Times.

In January 1871, a new newspaper, The New York Bulletin, published a picture of the original sign. Two years later in October 1872 the New York Gazette reprinted the picture and the story of Wilson's letter. (Other sources say that a newspaper of the same name ran stories about a "Great Pyramid" in 1878; it appears that an ad appeared in a local magazine for the week of July 18, 1878.)

The significance of this story is not yet clear. It probably inspired Joseph Campbell to write The Hero with a Thousand Faces, in which he discussed the Great Pyramid at the heart of ancient Egyptian culture. However, the story seems to be an example of the mythmaking that characterized the development of journalism during the nineteenth century. The story of this strange building was a good chance for journalists to use the latest scientific theories to tell a story about ancient Egypt, or in some cases to make some sensational claim—such as the legend of the Great Pyramid's secrets—that is too good to check out.

The New York City Board of Health decided to investigate the pyramid because of the news stories—in particular The News in 1872—that the building and its "summarium" (the pyramid-like pedestals) were an example of "pyramidal architecture, or pyramidal architecture which may be regarded as the greatest curiosity in architecture." In contrast, other buildings in New York's State Thicket had no obvious significance except for being situated within the boundaries of the Thicket.

What we know about the Great Pyramid today

The Great Pyramid is a massive, four-sided, conical structure of roughly 100 meters on each side. The walls run on the horizontal axis through the two lower levels, while the upper levels rise steeply to a height of roughly 5,300 meters. The Great Pyramid is nearly two kilometres in diameter and its diameter is an impressive 26 meters less than that of the nearby Washington Monument. The outer casing is of gypsum, a mineral that occurs in granular forms, often described in the New York Times as resembling "little grains of sand."

There is no evidence to suggest that the builders of the pyramids at Gizeh and Saqqara built the pyramids on purpose, but a number of scholars believe that they were built for various reasons. This is especially likely if one accepts the idea that pyramids were meant for rulers to live in while they ruled (a theory that still holds today). According to one account, as early as the 6th century BC, several pyramid masons were buried by ancient Egyptians in the Valley of the Kings.

Although the Great Pyramid was the main pyramid for ancient Egypt and has been the most visited monument by tourists, it also has many lesser monuments. The two lesser pyramids that make up the Sphinx are known as Giza's Lower and the Middle. However, the largest pyramid in the world, built for Khufu in Khafra's time, is located in the Egyptian city of Abu Simbel. The main chamber of the pyramid is on the west side of the pyramid (its north wall). The upper reaches of the pyramid are made of limestone, and its walls are of stone.

Giza pyramid contains the remains of two buildings.

Giza's Lower and Upper pyramids are the most prominent features within Giza. Although these structures have been under excavation, they are not yet fully realized on the surface, although there are hopes that this phase is nearing completion.<|endoftext|>For all the attention paid to Apple's announcement last week of iOS 8, Microsoft's Windows 8 has managed to remain underappreciated.

Rep. Paul Ryan is leading the effort to cut N.I.H. funding; and on Tuesday, he gave a speech touting the provision, which he called "an important first step toward reforming the bloated, inefficient NIH and making sure it is focused on its core mission, creating and sustaining medical breakthroughs."


Is that really the best place to be putting a significant chunk of money, especially since there are better ways to address the growing number of people who may require medical breakthroughs? Of course not.

But it is the best, most cynical way for Republicans to try to cut some extra money to increase Medicare spending. Republicans in the House and Senate are proposing to pay for the cuts through a new tax on private hospitals. But the problem with the private-health-insurance tax is that it is an effective cut that raises money for Medicare.

The N.I.H. is the largest of America's public or private health researchers. Its research spending in 2015 totaled $34.5 billion, or 10 percent of the country's total medical research and development spending of $380 billion. That amounts to about $8 of every $10 that Medicare spends on health care, including hospital costs to provide care that is not covered by Medicare, according to a 2013 report by the N.I.H.

According to our research, hospitals and patients are more and more using health insurance for non-emergency care, such as inpatient hospital stays and non-emergency treatment that may be needed to stabilize patients. About 50 percent of Americans who buy private insurance have a plan with some kind of outpatient doctor visits. And if we pay more for hospitals to treat more patients, then there will always be demand for more hospital beds for non-emergency care.

Medicare isn't the only government agency that makes use of health insurance for non-emergency care, however. Private hospitals themselves have long made use of insurance plans to help them compensate hospitals and doctors who provide care outside of hospitalization, known as other out-of-network care.<|endoftext|>The idea for NieR comes from a conversation between writer Yoichi Kotabe and producer Yosuke Saito at a coffee shop. The conversation was part of the "D-Pad" series about how to put a game together, so the first thing I wanted to know was, "What is NieR, and why is it important?"

NieR is a sci-fi action-adventure title developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. It is the sequel to 2010's Platinum's action RPG, Vanquish. The two games are the last two titles developed by studio PlatinumGames in Tokyo (and the only two that have been released, so we'll stick with them).

Unlike its predecessor, NieR was designed to be an action-adventure video game. It follows a young soldier named Riley Ashelon and her squad, with new hero Machina as their leader. The game features a mix of stealth, action and platforming elements, along with a few more conventional elements like combat and puzzles. (It also contains several anime-esque character designs, such as the one on the cover of our review).

The game's plot is told both in-game and through non-explicit flashbacks.

It's a short experience - about 30 to 40 hours of gameplay depending on how much you play. And I did play a bit. A very small bit.

What do I mean by that? Well, I don't mean you could sit in a chair and play the whole game for three or four hours at a time...

You can play the game over and over for several hours, but only after you finish a section (though you can restart parts after completing them, so it doesn't feel like overkill to try again).

While that was my experience, other players have said some of NieR's more interesting areas to explore are a little tougher to get to. What does that mean? Well, it's possible you simply don't know how to get there.

To get there you'll need to use an emergency beacon system that can be triggered by using the Switch Switch to flip the gamepad in the direction you want your character to face as you walk around (like in the screenshot below). It's not quite how it looks (it's actually used on the Wii version of the game), so it's unclear whether the Switch makes it appear.

Klimmek will lead you to an open area with many skeletons and one final, large skeletal structure. He will inform you that the key can only be used at a grave marker, so head back to Volunruud and activate a stone cairn to find the location of one of them:

The Restless Grave

Upon your arrival here, enter the cave and locate Volunruud's grave marker, by entering through the locked entrance on the opposite side of the area:

The Restless Grave

The grave marker will be marked by a large skull. Inside Klimmek will be waiting for you, along with a number of his vampires. Take out the vampires, and then quickly loot his chest to find the key, which will lead to a few more vampires who you can kill for more loot. Then talk to the dead vampire and tell him to stay at the grave. At this point you have the opportunity to pickpocket a few more items from them.

The next time you enter Volunruud, you will see six more vampires, led by two vampires you killed in the first part of the quest (two if you are human). Kill these and the final vampire (and any others you may have already killed or found previously) to complete the quest.

Reward [ edit ]

Upon completion of this quest, the following rewards will be handed to you:

4,550 gold

10,000 gold

3 Skill books

Notes [ edit ]

If you decide to attack all of the vampires at once before you receive this quest, you can continue on to the next quest, Night of the First Stone , as the final part of this quest does not actually occur. Also, you can always return to Klimmek, either after the initial conversation or upon completion of the quest.

, as the final part of this quest does not actually occur. Also, you can always return to Klimmek, either after the initial conversation or upon completion of the quest. There are no more locations where you can find the key.

There is a small possibility that after you have accepted your rewards from Klimmek and left the cave, all but three vampires become hostile during the following conversation. Kill them all and return to the grave marker with a leveled weapon to retrieve the key.

If you use a spell on the key, it will stay in Klimmek's possession, just like the other five pieces of the key. Also, if you tell Klimmek to stay at the grave he will not leave. He will continue to wander Volunruud as before, where he will even tell you that you have "taken what you wanted", though he won't leave his spot.

Klimmek will start the quest again if you wait for him outside of the cave.

Bugs [ edit ]

There will be no quest marker to the grave marker once completed, even if you have used the key. ?

If you pickpocket a quest item from the vampires during this quest, you will not get the reward you were expected for this quest in your inventory. ?

It is possible, but as of yet not a bug, that you will be teleported to the front of the gate that connects to the burial grounds

Rajesh G. Gupta is the author of "Innovating with Innovation: How to Get Ahead and Stay Ahead." He has worked in technology for more than 20 years, including as a columnist for Time Inc., where he now writes about startup strategies. He is also a board member for both IAM (Institute for the Advanced Study of Men) and Stanford Entrepreneur Institute.


At an IAM event in August, Mr. Gupta spoke with Michael Erlich, the CEO of iWatch. This interview follows an interview last week with Mr. Rajeev Ramchandani, the chairman and chief executive of e-commerce site MakeMyTrip.com. In that interview he also talked about the possibility of selling his share of the mobile-app developer for the Flipkart group to Flipkart for about $3.15 billion. As the Indian company has done many times before, it's a huge bet by Flipkart's founders and top management. The question that has to be asked is, does this move help or hurt Flipkart? And what's the chances that it'll pay off?

This interview is condensed and lightly edited.

Mr. Gupta: How do you think the Flipkart sale would enhance your ability?

Rajesh G. Gupta: Flipkart is a huge success. It makes all kinds of smart investments in marketing and retail. It's so ambitious in its approach, and that's why it's a winner every single time it tries something new. We think that this is just one more step on an exponential curve to that success.

If you look at e-commerce, online shopping is still really growing, but it's not expanding in a way that makes sense. You can see that it's getting more expensive every day, and there are fewer buyers to attract to those transactions and increase the value. Flipkart believes that if you expand your reach in China, the people who would make the purchases are online.

They believe that the most important thing you should do in China is to help people who are buying on Amazon.com. In other words, Flipkart is the one company that does a great job of bringing that online buying experience to China, and we saw an opportunity to help them take it to the next level.

It's a huge bet by Flipkart's founders and top management, especially after its recent struggles when it was hit by issues with its logistics and its payments infrastructure.

What's the main takeaway?

It's always important to keep an open mind and consider new opportunities before making your decision in a situation that offers many upside and downside risks.

We think we've taken that approach. If I have to bet my own money on one outcome, I'd argue that it'll make things easier for Flipkart and for the Indian consumer.

You talked about your view on e-commerce, the value in having a network in China, the importance of Alibaba in this country, and how it could help Flipkart grow.

If you look at the e-commerce market in India, it's dominated by two players, Flipkart and Snapdeal. If you look at the value of the network they have established, and the value that Alibaba can add, it makes a lot of sense.

To give you an idea of that, Alibaba has a market cap of about $168 billion, and Flipkart is around $45 billion. Alibaba is probably an even bigger player because of its technology and its vast scale. Flipkart on the other hand has a market cap of about $40 billion, and Alibaba is about $68 billion. So it gives you a sense of how much Alibaba could bring to the table through its technology.

Would you consider selling Flipkart now?

I wouldn't say that right now, but I see an opportunity to buy a piece of Flipkart.

How would that help Flipkart? Would it help in the short-to-medium term?

Yes. I think it would help.

Have you thought about the possible deal price?

Yes, I think it's worth $8 billion.

How would you go about doing this?

We have a process called "going public" that we've used before. It's like when you go into an IPO. You have a very public and transparent process, including going public with an EIS (equity in company) in India. And we have the advantage of having two shareholders: two shareholders are already in. For someone to bid for a piece of Flipkart is very difficult in our market. They have to wait for one of them to say 'yes,' and when the other says 'no,' it's very hard to make a deal because he doesn't have to share anything with the first side.

What the Flipkart board could decide is what the board decides. If they decide

On this day, 1 November 2004, the Supreme Court rules against a former British Army soldier who claims that the army had raped him when he was a child.

David Blunkett was convicted of sexually attacking a child under 14 at a house in Manchester during the early 1960s. He was fined £1,000 by a military court. It was in this case that the then-British Home Secretary Jack Straw said of the soldier's case, "The evidence of his appalling offences is so powerful that he is serving a sentence which is beyond the sentence we would impose on a child rapist."

That description was later echoed by former president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso when he said this was "the most serious abuse of children that we have seen since the Second World War", and the conviction was upheld on appeal.

However, at the end of 2002, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) appealed the sentence and appealed it again.

The MoD claimed that the soldiers and the teenager at the house, Mark Lawrence, were strangers and therefore innocent. The High Court (HCC) agreed however, that Lawrence had made "false, misleading, and inappropriate" statements and the MoD failed to disclose to the Court that the soldier was being prosecuted for sexual assault.

Following the appeal, Blunkett was jailed for two years.

The U.S. company is shutting down and consolidating its Honeywell manufacturing and engineering facilities in Michigan, including plant in Holland Township, according to a news release.

The announcement was effective immediately and workers are being notified by March 30, company officials said in a joint statement. The announcement comes less than two months after Honeywell announced it was eliminating 1,800 jobs in Michigan in its "strategic reduction" with the loss of a combined 6,450 jobs.

"Today Honeywell and its employees are facing a number of difficult challenges, but the company's focus and commitment to Michigan continues," said Scott Hensley, Honeywell's executive vice president, in the company's statement. "Honeywell's decision to cease operations at its operations in Holland Township will allow us to reduce our global workforce, align our workforce to our core strategy and maximize our efficiencies while delivering the best quality and value to our customers, employees and shareholders."

The company will begin to close down and consolidate facilities in two states -- Louisiana and Michigan -- during 2017, the statement continued.

Honeywell will hire 100 current Honeywell employees in South Bend in March to work with some of Honeywell's manufacturing operations, said David Lauterbach, president and chief executive of the local Chamber of Commerce.

"It's very unfortunate, to be that much smaller," Lauterbach added in the news release. "It's not exactly a good feeling to lose those jobs."

While honeybees for crops such as corn and soybean, have seen a decline in popularity, Honeywell engineers also are making advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence and sensors to better understand the insects' behavior.

Honeywell currently has nearly 1,700 employees in the state across plants in Holland Township, New Center, Lansing, South Bend, Holland, Saginaw, Michigan Lakes, Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor and Jackson, Michigan.

Honeywell employs more than 12,000 people in the United States and Canada.

It is unclear whether Honeywell plans to offer severance packages to impacted workers. Those decisions are made at each location. Some employees could also work remotely, but Honeywell's announcement stated employees would not be eligible for relocation benefits.

Honeywell officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

Those words came from a completely different person than the one who had just told me about the beast. The man who was in front of me was speaking with a trembling voice.

"You know already, right? No, that is not true, I am a high level alchemist. After all, that type of magic is only possible with the powers of an Alchemist. That's why I can do this."

"And the next was... it was a giant... monster, in other words a god of destruction?"

If the first four chapters of "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1" set the stage for a new dystopian saga, the fifth chapter of what is supposed to be "The Hunger Games" trilogy looks like a series of reinterpretations of popular culture and an affirmation of the status quo. (Katrina Cervantes)

"When I was a little kid, I thought my grandmother was going to have to eat two steaks a day," he said.

In the final movie of the trilogy, an 11-year-old Katniss Everdeen must survive as she and her comrades march through the capital of Panem in a quest to kill President Snow. But when she returns home, the world she knew is no longer here. The old, safe rules no longer apply. There is no way out of the situation she finds herself trapped in — a girl in a man's world who has to kill her own mother because she cannot fight on his side. Or take a job with the Capitol. Or betray her sister and kill a fellow competitor.

The latest installment, "Mockingjay," opened on a Tuesday, the same day that Miley Cyrus's "Wrecking Ball" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Yet the two films that premiered on the same Sunday also had to contend with the same cultural problems and the same criticisms.

Cyrus and the film industry's leaders had to wrestle with why a 15-year-old girl is more influential than she was a century ago — and why her music and image are a catalyst for widespread cultural change. Yet the industry was also left wondering about an industry in which young women remain in the shadows, making fewer bucks, working part-time and enduring a constant barrage of violence and harassment — even as their numbers grow in Hollywood.

Here, the film industry and the culture at large weigh in on the problems and issues facing teens in the entertainment industry.

Miley Cyrus: 'I'm not a victim'

A week after "Mockingjay," Cyrus was interviewed on the "Today" show with co-host Savannah Guthrie. The segment was supposed to be focused on Cyrus's new music video for her single "Wrecking Ball," which depicts two teenage girls trying to escape a male antagonist's unwanted advances.

But the topic quickly shifted when Guthrie asked Cyrus a question that many industry leaders say is relevant to Hollywood at large: Why, in a culture where teen girls can reach their full potential, doesn't Cyrus focus on writing adult material herself?

"What's this supposed to mean?" she asked. "Why do we let this happen to these girls?"

The reaction to the video was swift and unforgiving.

"I'm not a victim. I haven't been a victim, and there's plenty of things that people can point at me for that," Cyrus replied. "But at the end of the day, when I do my music, and when I perform and when I have my concert and when I go on these talk shows, I don't care who's watching," she said.

On Friday, after "Wrecking Ball" had been viewed more than 10 million times, Cyrus tweeted, "I will always stand by and support our kids to have the most beautiful lives that they deserve."

The reaction to the video was swift and unforgiving.

The most effective response came from Cyrus's Twitter account. "I've said it many times before," the tweet said. "The more people who are on my side, the better."

The criticism on Twitter was so bad that Cyrus had to respond, saying, "This is why I didn't get my MTV Cribs & that was a mistake. I don't know how to make things right with some of the people that I've hurt."

The ruling by State Supreme Court Justice Barbara A. Parry is scheduled for a hearing on Friday. If her ruling goes the way the federal courts that preceded her favored, the city could have a ban on the sale of "assault weapons and high capacity magazines" that would go into effect by July 1.

Parry said a recent ruling by her predecessor, Justice Diane Wood, that the city had to allow the lawsuit to proceed did not grant the plaintiff enough time to present her case.

"No other court within the United States would permit the plaintiffs' attorney, in a proceeding that is under its jurisdiction, to ask a series of questions for 20 years while the case proceeds," Parry said in a letter to the city's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, on June 10, according to CNN. "My office made it clear that we were ready to be present at any hearing, provided that the plaintiff's attorney was prepared to answer those questions by [the trial's] commencement date."

Gun control group, CeaseFireNY, said in a statement that the city had ignored court requests.

"It is appalling that the City has decided to push its luck by delaying this critical case from even being heard until July 1. The City is once again trying to put the interests of violent criminals ahead of the safety of law-abiding gun owners," said John Feinblatt, president of CeaseFireNY, in a statement.

In January 2012, a federal appeals court in Brooklyn threw out a similar lawsuit that the plaintiff, Joe Percoco, had filed.

The appeals court said the mayor lacked the power to regulate common firearms and magazines, because all arms and magazines that the government regulates are defined by statute.

The three-to-two decision in the Second Circuit Court did not determine the city's right to restrict sales of "assault weapons" or "high capacity magazines" -- the only categories in the law -- as an essential part of a law-and-order agenda.

But the ruling could open the floodgates for New York politicians who support banning assault weapons and other firearms accessories to pass new laws. They could limit the sale of common accessories and allow the possession of "assault weapons" with one of the exceptions in the law.

"This will be the Supreme Court's final word on the matter and the result could have a major impact on the future of gun control laws in New York City," said David C. Rosenberg, founder and chief executive of CeaseFireNY.

The NFLPA now has to file their response in the case.


(Read more here: http://blogs.wsj.com/sports/2013/07/14/nfl-PA-vs-nfl-players-union-filed-virgin-island-court/)


The case stems from a "non-statutory" rule, which was used to determine players' compensation in the 2005 CBA, because "it was a non-statutory provision, not expressly enumerated in the labor agreement, but otherwise subject to the same standards applied to statutory provisions."


"The issue in this appeal has been whether this provision provides an employee who plays in at least half of the teams in a league the basic minimum compensation for the work they engage in. While courts are reluctant to substitute their individual views of the correct interpretation of a statute for all employees in an industry, the fact that there is now a federal Circuit precedent indicating the correct interpretation of these provisions means that the question will soon be decided in the federal courts," explained the NFLPA in the response.

All of a sudden, a picture of a man who, for a significant amount of time, had a loaf of bread in both hands while sitting on a sidewalk while doing absolutely nothing popped up on the wall of my mind. The story of Bread Man would come to be, for me, a metaphor for the times when I experienced the growing pains of growing up. For me, that meant that I would always be hungry, at some point or another in my life. And I guess I also took Bread Man's bread as inspiration for why I wanted to become a chef.


The funny thing, however, is that I know exactly which store I bought my loaf of bread from. I bought it on the day that I graduated from high school. I remember that day distinctly due to the fact that my mother had put a heavy lid on all the pots that were boiling. I had a hard enough time waiting for my lunch that my mother was worried I might choke to death that day. Of course, she was worried too but I had to make sure that the lunch was all ready. The thought of my mother having a hard time bringing the lunch over to her room that day did nothing to deter me from staying away from the cafeteria that day. It was an early memory I kept until the day she passed away.


I didn't become a professional chef until the next year because then I was just too busy and too hungry to sit at home and cook for myself. I also have a vague recollection that some of my senior classmates were cooking for that year. They all seemed to be in college and I'm pretty sure that my roommate, who has just since graduated, was a senior on his first trip to culinary school. I certainly never considered it, but if I did I'm pretty sure I would have been a very bad cook.


At no point did I ever feel like I was missing out on anything by being enrolled at college. I wasn't missing any classes because I was eating less during the school day and that probably resulted in being late to classes. I did feel like I had something to learn. I didn't feel like I was missing anything at the beginning because I was working so many shifts that I had enough hours in the day to get through college. I also enjoyed the classes I took in the school, even

The official Facebook page for the television anime adaptation of Kazumi Fujita and Hirogi Yoshida 's Shōyō Ninpoushin' manga announced on Saturday that Junji Kō and Hiroyuki Tsubasa will play the series' two main characters, Shinobu and Yukiteru, respectively. The duo will appear in the pilot episode.

The other main cast members include:

Seirei Tsukui will also appear as an enemy in the anime, alongside the female character from Tōken Ranbu -ONLINE- . Takahiro Sakurai will play Shinobu. Tōru Murase will play Yukiteru. Rina Hidaka and Kana Hanazawa will play Shinobu's parents, and Sōma Saitō will play his older father. Kento Yamazaki , Daisuke Namikawa , Shun Egawa , and Hiro Shimono will star in the anime.

Fujita began the original manga in 2013. Shogakukan published the 13th compiled book volume in Japan on January 10, and Viz Media is publishing the manga in English, with the release date originally set for 2016.

The manga's story takes place in an alternate history in China in 300 A.D., in the Tang Dynasty. A century after the death of a powerful emperor, an old man and an adolescent woman stumble upon a manuscript describing a legend of gods and demons who protect humankind. They decide to go to the ancient city of Jin to ask the gods for help. However, when they arrive, the young woman is abducted by a mysterious stranger. The mysterious stranger gives the old man a magical book with three magic seals that can open any door.

Fujita launched the manga in Shogakukan 's Weekly Shōnen Sunday magazine in 2013, and Shogakukan will publish the 16th compiled volume on January 9. An earlier chapter of the manga ran in Weekly Shōnen Sunday in April 2012. Kodansha Comics published the sixth volume in North America on March 3.

The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change and the authors said a study done by another team of scientists was "confirming" their findings.

They claimed that their results would contradict the "consensus" that humans caused "approximately half of observed increase in global average surface temperature since 1951".

So what's the issue with that statement?

The first part of the statement is not true. There is no statistical evidence to conclude that human activity has had a significant impact on global temperature to the best of our knowledge.

What's more, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that humans have "significantly changed mean global temperatures".

That report said the increase in temperature since the Industrial Revolution "has been very large". This means that, with the possible exception of the last 15 years, it has been in an upward trending direction.

The second part doesn't matter. However, the first part makes clear that researchers have found no statistical association between an increase in the temperature and the total number of researchers worldwide.

The authors make clear that their results do not dispute the concept of AGW but rather they simply don't prove a cause-effect relationship. This is a scientific point worth considering. I'll explain that in more detail below.

The authors state that, in the last decade, the total number of researchers in the field of climate has increased by approximately 5 per cent year-on-year. Their conclusion is that, "in contrast to the observed increase of the total number of global researchers, the increase of the number of experts is not detected to be consistent in their scientific opinion of the anthropogenic origin of global warming."

Their study does not prove a cause-effect relationship and in fact, according to a study by The Guardian, the increase in climate researcher is not an increase in the amount of research taking place at all.

The Guardian article also says:

A US study published on Monday found that scientists were doing more to tackle global warming than they were before the year 2000. The authors of the study, led by Anthony Leiserowitz of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication at Yale, found that global efforts to control greenhouse gases were more intensive than they had ever been in the past 20 years.

The article also says that:

The scientists also found that the average number of papers published in the field of climate change is up for the first time in many years. It also found that the global average increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is on a downward trajectory following a slight increase in 2013.

In light of this call, I've asked Gun Policy USA Executive Director Wayne LaPierre to share his thoughts on the gun lobby.

Wayne La Pierre

I came into gun policy at age 19, when I was a student at Princeton University. I was on campus when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered. I learned that Dr. King's dream for a world without violence had been achieved in his lifetime.

So, on the campus I joined my classmates in a silent vigil. A month later I volunteered for a gun control group that met at the Capitol of my home state. On that day, I was handed a packet of literature that said I was "a criminal." I took it to my dorm room, where it remained for the next 10 years, unread. I could not understand the logic and reason behind it then.

In 1989 I was attending the University of Washington Law School when President Ronald Reagan signed the infamous Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. I was working on a case that would put a federal constitutional challenge to the law before the US Supreme Court, which was the most important one of the decade. Before we could get back to the case however, the Brady Act was declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, which, in a 5-4 decision, confirmed that "gun control" was a federal crime.

Since then I have watched as many cities and states, like Boston, Boston and Boston and New York City, have instituted universal background checks as a check against gun violence. I have seen the effectiveness of gun safety education. I have seen how gun violence destroys a family, how it is the greatest single killer of men under 30. I have watched as cities, state, and federal governments across our nation have passed laws to make our neighborhoods safer.

I am also grateful for efforts by groups like CeaseFire, Gun Owners of America, and Moms Demand Action to protect and defend our right to keep and bear our firearms.

In my travels and meetings, I have found that every gun lobby and its members has one thing in common: Fear of gun violence. Many of these groups would rather have a black man, a Muslim woman, or a young parent killed than be seen doing anything that supports civil liberties, or which would require them to take the responsibility for their failure to protect their own kids.

In the last week of January, one victim of gun violence was killed in my home state of Washington by his brother while the two were trying to take their own lives. My wife and children are at home with nothing more than a few memories of our wonderful brother as they grieve their loss. The media has moved on as well, but the memories remain.

The only thing I ask of people is this: The gun lobbyists are afraid they might lose their tax exempt status, their ability to speak at the state or national levels, their ability to donate freely to your campaign. The gun lobbyists want control but that is another conversation for another day.

Rather than focusing on all the guns in America, the goal should be to protect our children, our neighbors, and ourselves. The next time you see a story about an unarmed young person shot by police, ask: Who are they? Why isn't gun violence the dominant topic? Why is it that the National Rifle Association is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in a futile attempt to influence an election?

My friend and colleague, Tom Smith, a former Washington State Representative, put it well. "The gun lobby
======================================== SAMPLE 252 ========================================
In 2010, an average of 1,000 new residents would move to Vancouver in one year, but this year's average of 1,100 will make it more than 6,000, a 50% increase. This is the strongest year for migration to any Canadian city in the 10 year time period between 2002 and 2012.

While many Canadians will not move into a Toronto apartment to live in Vancouver, there are enough to add to the city's housing capacity. That is why a Toronto-bound household could have a family of 4 and still be able to easily fit three other people into an average Toronto housing budget. If the average household size (with two adults and two children) were doubled, that household could comfortably live in almost all of Toronto's housing stock, or more than half of the current Toronto housing stock including all of the condos, townhomes, and laneway houses. If we used the average household size, instead, in a Vancouver household, it would only need to house two people, not more than a third of Toronto households, in order to comfortably buy a house in Toronto.

Since only the demand can determine the rate of housing production, how could Toronto house the demand for people with a higher cost to support their families with a more affordable housing supply?

The answer lies in adding an additional 40,000 to 55,000 to GTA's housing inventory.

To calculate Toronto's housing supply, one needs to consider three factors: the percentage of households living in subsidized or low-income housing, the percentage of census residents living in single-detached homes, and the percentage living in condos and townhomes. When these three variables are added, the total number of housing units in Toronto (combined with the number of new and existing properties) is equal to the number of households. Therefore, the total supply of housing in Toronto is equal to the number of households that live in subsidized and low-income housing.

While the overall number of housing units is equal to the number of households, housing supply in Toronto is only equal to the share of housing units provided to households with lower income than the median. In reality, the proportion of Toronto households with lower income than median is closer to half. In 2010, almost 20% of Toronto households lived in subsidized condos and townhomes, but only about 12-13% of the income in these units was received through social assistance or low-income housing rents. By contrast, 30% percent of Toronto households had incomes of $30,000 or less. For these two reasons, it is clear that the supply of housing in Toronto should have a higher level of demand to overcome any demand for affordable homes. In this respect, the increase in the demand for housing in Vancouver is a net positive for Canada rather than a deficit or surplus.

The Toronto census reveals another important factor for housing supply. Of the 469,450 people in Toronto in 2011, 49% were households headed by someone 65 years of age or older, 21% by someone between the ages of 35-44, and 22% by someone between the ages of 15-24. With higher demand for housing in Toronto, housing supply should be increased to meet this higher demand. By having more affordable housing in Toronto, the demand to live in Toronto will be limited to people in those ages 45-54, those 55 and above, and those 18-24.

This will create a stronger financial incentive for governments to provide public housing for Toronto residents in order to preserve existing public housing supply. While it is unlikely that most Canadians will be interested in moving to Toronto to live with their families and contribute to the cost of public housing, the financial benefits associated with public housing can offset the increased housing costs associated with moving.

Toronto's housing needs were not made any more obvious by Toronto Mayor Ford and his plan to replace the affordable housing programs with private rental options. In fact, it is now clear that Ford was the greatest obstacle preventing public or affordable public housing from being developed in Toronto. While Toronto city council considered proposals to create affordable public housing in Scarborough and North York, Ford refused to support any of these alternatives. Instead he made it clear that he wanted public housing to be replaced with affordable rental housing. This has led to questions in Toronto whether Ford's real motives for using public housing as a political tool was to drive up the cost of public housing to keep the public housing in place.

The answer is, no it does not. Instead, this is a clever move to increase property tax revenue by increasing tax base in favour of private rental. With all other factors equal, if the same percentage of the tax base is spent on public housing as on public rental housing, public housing will produce lower revenue compared to public rental housing.

In order to ensure that this tax revenue generated from private rental does not benefit the wealthiest individuals in our society, a portion of this revenue will be diverted to funding public rental assistance. If private rental increases by 50%, then it will be able to offset the lost revenue

Citizens,

We want to help you learn, in the best way possible, how your political views may be reflected in your DNA. We are currently compiling data from hundreds of thousands of DNA sequences to identify political and ideological preferences and then we're working on getting this done.

With that said, we recognize that the study of political beliefs could be a very challenging one for scientists; you may not have all the answers, but we invite you to join our community and participate in our effort to get to the bottom of political differences in the gene pool.

All you have to do is sign up on our study website and we'll start sending out surveys to members of the Canadian population in the coming months. We'll be sending these out over the next few weeks and months to thousands and thousands of citizens (sorry folks in the U.S.!) from various parts of the country; we want to gather as much data as possible - but we need your help!

We will be using a genetic method called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to do this study. We think the most common questions people have are:

Are there differences in political ideology amongst people with and without certain genes?

How much do gene variants like the rs11605579 gene variation have to do with political beliefs?

Are certain gene variants like the rs11605579 gene variation important?

Are the results of PCA useful?

You'll note in the questionnaire that we ask you to fill out your political beliefs (your level of agreement with a variety of claims) as one of six possible answers. In addition to the other things we're asking you, your opinion concerning the genetics of political ideology is important to us, because there are many ways people's genes might modify their political attitudes. PCA can be used to get an answer to these types of questions.

A recent paper by Dinesh Kumar and his colleagues using this type of approach in a large-scale survey in India found that political ideology differs significantly in relation to variation in a particular gene variant. Their study of thousands of people across three large Indian states (and across several languages) found that while genetic variation between people is likely to explain a certain amount of variance within politics, the results vary substantially if genes are studied in more detail.

In an earlier report, we discussed the possible genetic basis of political ideology, and we talked about our initial attempts to find answers using PCA (see our blog - "Political Beliefs Are Highly Heritable"). We're hoping to use your PCA results to help us further understand the politics of Ontario and Canada.

Thank you for taking a few minutes to respond to this study. With your help we still believe the study will result in new, important insights. For more information, please see this post from Prof. David Healy at the University of Oxford. Your responses will help us to make this study better. Thank you again.<|endoftext|>Habitat A large predatory bird that preys on large insects such as beetles and scorpions. Also known as the pheasant, pheasants make quiet, low-pitched grunts while searching for prey or flying low. They sometimes are seen hunting in flocks with other birds. Females tend to be larger in size than males and are brown to brown in color; males are sometimes orange in color or more often have bright red or orange heads.

Reproduction Females pair for life and produce one to three egg sacs per year. Both parents take care of the chicks and feed them with the same diet that they get in the nest.

Conservation About half of the pheasant population that exists today was hunted almost completely to extinction 50 years ago. Despite these pressures, the pheasant was able to recover. Today, only 4,000 of the species are known to be threatened around the world. With just a few hundred remaining, a small number can have large effects on local ecosystems, and the species is still a threat to agriculture and human development throughout much of its range.<|endoftext|>For any news or news-related discussion (not a donation or sponsorship request per se as it doesn't fit into the sidebar), I have a page on the forums where I'll put all of that.

======================================== SAMPLE 254 ========================================
The new-generation Miata was created in conjunction with Ford (NASDAQOTH:F) in 1999 and was the first attempt to create a practical all-aluminum sports car to take on the Corvette. It wasn't the only sports car developed by Ford at the time since their SVT division was heavily engaged in trying to sell them. The MX-5 was a very good car but didn't sell well and the T1600 concept was a pretty interesting idea but didn't succeed at Ford.

There was also a Mazda Miata concept made in conjunction with Chevrolet, but that was more of an incremental improvement to a model already in production. It didn't have the weight savings to compete with the competition. In terms of quality, Mazda was on par with American sports cars but Ford wasn't making cars that were good enough to catch and pass on price and features. What's interesting is that the Miata was actually an effort to sell more Mustang's than it was an effort to beat the Corvette.


A year after Miata's conception, Corvette was introduced to both the American car makers but Ford was the first to bring a sports car to the US market. The original Miata was actually offered to a number of buyers by Ford dealers so it sold well before the Corvette was even in production. What was really important isn't that the Miata hit the market earlier but whether or not it was good enough. Not to be relegated to a car just for sport but for what it was made for.

Ford was selling Fords all-around and the small Miata was no match for a small Camaro, a small V8 Mustang or a big 4 cylinder Dodge. It was basically a small pony car. The Miata wasn't a bad car for a small car (and the original Miata is even still available in small trim) but it wasn't even the small car to beat. You could point to the original Miata and tell a number of car makers they were late to the game but in the end the Corvette was the first true sports car in the USA. It was the last of the '67-69 models to use steel in the body panels and I'd argue it's the better looking of the three.

The rest of the small car segment didn't hit until the mid 90's when Dodge came out with the Charger and Toyota came out with the Corolla. Each came with a large engine and some added features that put them on par with the big car competition. Even the small hatchback segment started with the Celica and the Acura TL started out as a small hatch.

The Corvette is an iconic sports car and it continues to be with a following that continues to grow after 20 years. But the Miata was actually good enough that it was a worthy competitor in the sporty segment. It's interesting to look at it from another perspective and realize that it was actually on a par with the Mustang and not the other way around. The Mustang sold like hot cakes but at the time it was a much bigger financial and financial engineering exercise to make a sporty sports car. With the Miata there was always a market for the sports car and it's interesting that Ford had a lot of success with it (especially in the mid 80's) and that the Miata actually had a number of successful models on the market from the 50's through the 90's.

The anonymous passenger says Bobby and Donald drove around the entire inaugural ceremony and were "throwing things at people."

"Donald started throwing things around the limo, hitting things, yelling at people," a source told The Daily Beast. "Bobby would just let go and shake his head, like, 'Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Why are you throwing things? Where is this shit?'"

"I feel sorry for him, and I hope he gets help," the source said.

According to a separate source, the driver claimed to be the victim of a "harassment campaign." They added that the driver made his feelings clear to Donald after the inauguration and asked to return to his own limousine.

Another source claimed to The Daily Beast that the anonymous driver did not have a good experience on the day of the inauguration, but he never reported the situation.

That anonymous driver didn't have a good experience on #InaugurationDay, either. But the problem is only because he didn't report it: https

The tax will apply only to home buyers who do not have at least a 20 per cent down payment.

The tax will be implemented during the course of the year, but won't become official until late next month.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the FHAT on Monday afternoon after he and fellow ministers presented their fiscal framework for the next five years on Parliament Hill.

The tax will add $300 to $400 to the average cost to purchase a $500,000 condo in Vancouver or $400 to $500 to a $1 million house in Toronto, according to TD's 2016 Real Estate Report.

"This is the worst possible timing for real estate – just before the holidays, no less – which is precisely a period of uncertainty which helps fuel the desire of foreign home buyers to purchase for the very purpose of flipping the condo or purchase as 'capital gain' through the use of a so-called 'foreign real estate investor tax,'" said Alex Gervais.

Gervais is chief executive of Alta Realty Inc., owner of Red City Realty.

"The tax is a nightmare for real estate.

"There's no clarity on exactly what this tax would be applied to.

"There's no transparency into what the parameters are on how the tax is applied to different situations, and this is the problem that the government has now made for itself," he said.<|endoftext|>A group of friends had a bit of a wild night out and got the wrong end of it.

There are tons of dessert bars out there. I can never seem to decide which one to try next. I think I've tried quite a few this year. So I think I've put together a list of the ones that I feel are the best and most unique. They are all delicious but the ones on this list are my pick of the best. And I promise, they are so yummy, you won't want to eat plain ones. And that's always a good thing.

So I want to say congratulations to my friend Stephanie Yee of Spoonful of Sugar and The Kitchn, whose list is really the best dessert bars out there. Stephanie is a food writer and blogger. Her list is amazing and a must read.

So here's my list of dessert bars and what you should know about each of them.

1. The Creamy Black Bean and Fiery Green Papaya Dip

This Black Bean & Fiery Green Papaya Dip is a fantastic dip. It is creamy yet not so rich that you will have trouble finishing all of the dip. It is made with beans, coconut milk, and green papaya in a blend that was the result of years of trial and error between Stephanie and Chef Sean from the Red Hen. It is a good dip.

2. The Coconut Milk Crème Brûlée

This Crème Brûlée by Chez René is a decadent dessert that can easily pass as a decadent dessert. The base is made with heavy cream and butter while whipped cream and white chocolate are combined to create the layers. It is not overly sweet so you might
======================================== SAMPLE 256 ========================================
1. The U.S. military is currently engaged in several ongoing conflicts abroad (Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, etc.) that it clearly doesn't need any more troops for.

The first, however, began in 2001 and is still going. We've also been fighting a war (which began in 2001) against a group of Islamic militants in Syria called ISIS. That's the latest one.

The Department of Defense announced last year its "enduring fight" for the Afghanistan war.

It is a war the Afghan military no longer wants, and they are beginning to leave their bases. Some Afghans have told reporters that they will start fighting other Afghans in retaliation. So we have still another war going.

The U.S. has troops in Iraq, and continues to support them and continue to wage a war there. But in the last year it seems clear that Iraq is no longer a war we're even going to win. It's clearly losing.

What's the point?

2. The Department of Defense is currently engaged in several ongoing operations for which it clearly doesn't need soldiers.

The Navy conducts "counter terrorism" operations in a number of places, mainly in the seas around the world. This does not need to be done in order to keep America safe. (Though it might be if it actually helped, like when the Navy was going after Somali pirates, or when it was supporting our mission in Yemen.)

The Air Force is also engaged in "counter terrorism" in a substantial number of locations around the world. It also doesn't need new troops to conduct it. It does want new planes, though, and some new planes would be welcomed:

This year, we will purchase an additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. … As we've said before, our F-35 is the best plane for the job in theater and will play an integral role in our future campaigns, such as the Afghanistan mission.

We just recently gave the new $2.85 billion in military aid to Egypt a "green light." How many more countries are we going to give that green light to?

I don't think that America should be using its troops for anything, anywhere. These are obviously war missions. They don't need troops to help them achieve their goals.

3. The Department of Defense wants to spend more on "war" than it would like:

So, we have some ongoing conflicts that we're in that we clearly do not need more members of the military to help keep America safe. But we're also spending money to train and equip our foreign allies to fight those wars on our behalf. And when it comes to those conflicts, Americans don't really enjoy "going to war." They enjoy keeping us safe, or at the very least, keeping us out of harm's way. … We must take the opportunity that these missions present to refocus our military on real threats in order to safeguard our national security.

But there's a catch. The war America actually wants does not require an expansion of its military force to win it. It only needs to remain strong and vital, and it still doesn't need any new people to fight it. So what's the point?

Also, spending more on "war" would make Americans more frightened about fighting the wars. For example, spending more on the "war on terrorism" would probably lead us to spend more training Americans to go fight for it. (Which was the point of the War on Terror, right?) Then the terror attacks of 9/11 would lead to a new "war on terror" that Americans really wanted all over again, which would mean a lot more fighting, and it would mean more fear.

4. The US government wants more money for "national security" initiatives instead of for the military.

The Department of Defense has increased the amount it spends on "national security" initiatives. This is because it needs more money to fight the wars America now wants to get out of. But what you might not know is that they've also increased the amount spent on what they call "force protection", the rest of which is just more police work, more prisons, more welfare, and so on. For more on the US's expanding security state, see this, this, this, this, and this.

5. The Department of Defense has created a "new, modern army", without any new people.

The "new, modern army" was created using the same old tactics the military has always used, except that it also added some extra new ones in the process. But again, it didn't need them.

In one example, it was used to build military bases in countries we don't want to keep around (like Afghanistan) and "enhance our security", as if we don't need this protection already. In another example, it was used to start new wars against countries we don't want to keep around

In a new interview with GQ, former President Bill Clinton says he regrets some of the policies he pursued as President, and that the Affordable Care Act had to pass on its own despite the president's support.

"The truth is what was hard about Obamacare was not the problems with it," Clinton said in the interview, with Newsweek's Ronan Farrow. "The hard part was trying to get people to accept it without the help of Democrats, Republicans, and independents. I feel good about Obamacare now in its progress."

Hillary Clinton is not currently a public figure, although her campaign is working on a book. Clinton also said he is ready to take on sexism, and in the spirit of equality, he said he doesn't want a woman president.

This isn't just in response to the Republican nominee Donald Trump. This is a sentiment I've had for years, and I don't know if it's going to change after Election Day," he said, "But if she gets elected, it's going to be hard to get into a discussion with her about any of it now. I'm not going to insult her for it."

Farrow reported that Clinton has "made it clear" that he is a "very firm supporter" of Bernie Sanders, who is now the Democratic nominee.

When asked if Sen. Sanders had ever reached out to him to discuss a future Clinton presidential campaign, Clinton said, "Never. I've always seen that kind of talk from both sides."

Clinton said he had no interest in the role of "vice president" with a Clinton Presidency because there is no way he'd have the time.

He also said he didn't think Hillary Clinton would be in her current position now if he were in her shoes, if that makes sense.

And while Hillary Clinton might be a "progressive" Democratic woman, he still thinks she deserves the nomination.

"In all my years in public life, and probably all the people I've known, most people would vote for anybody other than Trump or Cruz. But this is a race to the bottom," Clinton said. He concluded by saying, "If there was any doubt whatsoever about who should become our next president, that's dispelled. We have a new normal in politics."

Follow Datoc on Twitter and Facebook<|endoftext|>Cape Town – The South African Wildlife Trust (SWAT) is calling for the establishment of a "no kill" sanctuary for white rhinos in an appeal to the international community to join the fight to save the rhinoceros and rhino horn.

Speaking to The Huffington Post SA on the phone yesterday, SWAT executive director Mike Fitzpatrick said he was particularly grateful to the International Rhino Foundation, the wildlife trade monitoring NGO he works with, for its "inclusive and well informed" comments on South Africa's no-kill sanctuary initiative.

"It's heartwarming that the world's best known wildlife trade organisation is coming out in support of our efforts to save the magnificent black rhino," he added.

Speaking to The Huffington Post SA by phone on Wednesday, Fitzpatrick said that the idea for a no-kill sanctuary was first proposed by his wife, Marika, in 2008.

During the next two years, he said, he and Marika attended the global conference for The IUCN on Rhino and Tiger Conservation held in London in 2012. While there, he said he was present when delegates unanimously adopted a motion calling for all member-nations "to develop, implement and monitor a safe, well-resourced, sustainable no-kill sanctuary in collaboration with the IUCN to ensure extinction-free survival of the white rhino by 2030 and rhino and tiger respectively".

He said he was "very pleased to see" the IUCN call for no-kill sanctuaries, and that he considered the South African proposal to be "unique and significant".

After the outcome of the 2012 conference, Fitzpatrick decided to "re-imagine a no-kill sanctuary". "Our ultimate goal is to be able to achieve extinction-free survival of the rhinoceros, by 2024," he told HuffPost SA in an interview last Sunday.

He said that the SWAT no-kill sanctuary would be run by the South African National Parks and Wildlife Service (SanParks). It was his belief that only a no-kill sanctuary, he noted, "could sustain and support the rhinoceros and rhino horn markets".

"We're working hard with them towards this goal," he told HuffPost SA. Fitzpatrick said SanParks was "working on a number of fronts", including working with the Department of Environmental Affairs to develop sustainable management plans for the rhinos it held in captivity. "They already have rhinos in zoos, but it's a limited number," he noted.

Meanwhile, the South African government has been actively working with the International Union for

The idea is, to go out with a bang and, you know, "let it rain". Or not. It can be just about anything but you're going to be on your own if you have a date. Also, the girl needs to be someone from a college or university, preferably a single student. This is important because this is the type of person who'll be a little, what's the term? "Dude" or "girl" or something, that girl who does not know how to dress, you know, the college girl who can't buy more than two outfits to wear this year. She needs to be a total dork. I mean come on.

You see, dating is just about being cute and not giving a fuck. There you go. Now maybe the girl's personality, her social skills and her looks or something, that can be interesting. I mean that's good stuff to have to talk to the girl but still, the main thing with dating is to make yourself look attractive, even by looking like some dork who's only thinking about how hot he is. That's all that matters. I mean maybe he can be a smartass but he can't have a beautiful, smartass-ish girlfriend, right? That's why it's important not to take her too seriously. That's why you can't go out with a girl too hard or too quickly (which is good for someone who's trying to get into a relationship like a "girlfriend"), but you still have to let her get to know you so she understands you better.

You can tell when someone says, "I'm just looking out my window to have a nice, peaceful moment for the night" and you know what that means to her? That's she's got it bad. She's afraid she's going to lose you and you're scared that you're going to lose her. It gets very confusing.

I know there are a few other rules but those I'll have to wait to address at another time. For now, here it is. Remember, if you are serious, then it must be serious, right? Don't just go out and party, even if you're in a really good mood. If you can't be serious, you're just being shallow.<|endoftext|>When I talk about "the state of science," I start at the beginning. That gives me, at least, a solid starting point to work with.

In the mid-1980s I was working as a biochemist at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and there was a lot of activity at the time in the cancer research arena.

One of the questions being asked was whether or not people on chemotherapy had an increased risk of getting glioblastoma. This was an aggressive cancer with very little treatment options, and its prognosis was dismal even for those patients who survived for several years. This made us wonder how these patients would do if they received no treatment for the rest of their lives.

We began to do a bunch of experiments and found that patients who initially showed great benefit with chemotherapy had, well, not much longer to live anyway (in the normal range), as did patients who experienced some benefit while on chemotherapy for several years. The patients who survived the most were those who had received "timely" adjuvant treatments, including low doses of radiation. In other words, these trials revealed that a cancer patient's outlook depended largely on the kind of treatment he or she received.

Why is this important? Because, contrary to what you might think about science, it's not at all clear that anything is certain.

I mean, if you were looking for something to work on — say, the structure of DNA — might you say, "Oh, that's going to be easy: just run up to someone who's doing that and tell them that's the end of the matter?" Of course not! You need to conduct experiments, and get lots of people on board, and get them actually willing to study the question.

What we've discovered, in a nutshell, is that it's extremely difficult to predict what a drug or treatment will do for a cancer patient. This fact applies to all scientific subjects, whether it's astronomy, or statistics, or quantum mechanics, or any other field of study.

It's not that drugs and treatments are guaranteed to work, but the probability of an outcome seems to depend on many things, including how well a drug (or treatment) is tested and the characteristics of the patient or study group.

In science as in life, you'll never get 100% accurate results. You can find some patterns, but the chances of finding something in the data that makes sense are very low.

So, there's some wisdom to the old joke: "Science gives confidence; religion gives superstition."<|endoftext|>1 #1 jose 0 Frags – + The most beautiful place on planet earth! (In my humble opinion)

The FCA said in its statement that it had found "substantial evidence" that HSBC Bank USA, which it calls the primary subsidiary in the UK of the HSBC group, failed to identify and assess the risk of money laundering and had failed to implement effective internal controls.

It ordered HSBC to pay a $984 million penalty for violations of the FCA's money laundering provisions, which are designed to prevent people from withdrawing money to illicit ends.

HSBC said it was "disappointed" by the FCA's finding that it failed to carry out its anti-money laundering responsibilities and it considered the matter closed.

"We have consistently said that we are taking the appropriate steps to tackle the risks in our global regulatory environment," it said in a statement.

"The money-laundering enforcement action was an isolated event which arose from a single individual's misconduct," it added.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in October it would fine HSBC billions of dollars, and it said in March it was investigating other institutions, including Swiss banks, for similar lapses.

In 2010, HSBC paid almost $200 million in a settlement with U.S. authorities for violations dating back to the 1980s.

Earlier on Thursday, the FCA opened an investigation into the conduct of Barclays, Barclays's parent company, in relation to a potential money laundering probe.

The FCA had not yet determined if Barclays would be fined.

U.S. bank executives have come under increased scrutiny, especially in light of the 2010 "London whale" scandal, in which U.S. taxpayers' money - and in some cases the lives of U.S. servicemembers - were lost through the manipulation of interest rates.

The hospital saved my son's life, but they also became his biggest advocates. The organization they founded was dedicated to finding cures for childhood leukemia through research and education; they raised a record, nearly $300 million in the organization's 15-year history.

But one issue that has remained in the forefront for many years has been the treatment of these infants, who have a 90% relapse rate when they leave the hospital. Some doctors believe treatment with chemotherapy can potentially reverse the leukemia. In a country where many expect to get cancer, these are difficult lessons to learn in a hospital setting. St Jude currently treats 10,000 children each month with the disease. And it is not unusual to see children with the same mutation, which is called B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Children typically experience a remission after a treatment cycle, but at least a handful always relapse to leukemia. They don't necessarily feel different or any different when they leave the hospital. And that's what makes the research effort so critical. Children typically feel their best when they are surrounded by each other, even if it's through a hospital setting. "When you think of children, you almost always imagine them alone," says Linda Rosenbluth, chief medical officer at St. Jude. It is only in St. Jude that kids can be together, in the same room, with their doctors, nurses, and volunteers. These children live in foster homes, and those they are brought into hospitals have a different routine than the kids who go home alone. To be a team is not easy for children, who typically don't grow up with the same social ties as their peers and are often not raised in an environment that celebrates their uniqueness. "The whole culture of pediatric cancer treatment has shifted over the last 10 years," Rosenbluth says. "What a lot of schools and hospitals focus on is safety and treatment protocols, rather than what kind of school or family they come from. They may not have a large social network, but they have a group of like-minded peers who are very important to their identity." For kids with B-cell ALL, that peer group is one that grows organically: the same patients, most often those who look like you or your family. The people who work in the pediatric cancer program are the kind of people parents dream of having in their lives. They

The World Cup of Hockey could help revive North America's moribund game following a spate of high-profile defections to Europe, a senior Canadian hockey official says.

The World Cup of Hockey could help revive North America's moribund game following a spate of high-profile defections to Europe, a senior Canadian hockey official says.

Former NHL stars Rick Nash, Alexander Radulov, Joffrey Lupul and Ryan McDonagh have all expressed interest in playing in the tournament, which officially kicks off on Sept. 20.

And in a wide-ranging chat, one of the country's top hockey officials — himself a former superstar of hockey — also raised some concerns about players' long-term prospects in North America.

Canadian hockey has long been an international brand, but for decades it has failed to make any serious noise in the Olympics, with teams only emerging as serious contenders with a couple of successful campaigns at the world junior championships.

"My fear is Canada doesn't really have a good track record of being competitive at the Olympics," said Todd Cordell, Canada Hockey general manager.

"Whether you like it or not, for Canadian hockey, this is a really big deal."

A host of European players — including Steven Stamkos, Milan Lucic and Evgeni Malkin — were all once Canadian Olympians or won a gold medal for their country.

There has been a recent influx of some high profile defections from the sport, particularly in Europe.

Last week, two of the most powerful players in hockey, New Jersey Devils forward Travis Zajac and Calgary Flames defenceman T.J. Brodie, both signed with the Anaheim Ducks and Chicago Blackhawks respectively, respectively, as they made their NHL debuts.

Cordell said he expects some European hockey players to move to North America for the World Cup, with the prospect of NHL and AHL talent also being exposed.

"I would be very surprised to see a Canadian team not make the playoffs again, no matter where it is, in the next couple of years," he said.

The Canada Cup tournament is a national tournament for hockey players. It kicks off in Ottawa on Sept. 12.

Meanwhile, Cordell pointed out that the Cup is the highest prize in Canadian hockey, as it does not make the Olympic team.

He said he is optimistic about the Cup's return to Canada, despite the fact that it has only been staged a handful of times since the late 1980s with Canada's best team making it to the final round of the tournament eight times in the past 13 tournaments.

The final is expected to involve more than 30 of Canada's top players from junior hockey, NHL and minor pro teams.

Cordell added that he believes the NHL is finally beginning to get serious about trying to grow the sport in North America, after years of trying to woo hockey stars to join its national team — mainly after the 2004 Olympics — only to have them stay loyal to Europe.

He said that since the World Cup of Hockey is only six months away, the league will begin taking meetings shortly to set up plans for this year's tournament, with many of its coaches, players and executives already in the United States preparing for training camp.

Cordell also said he believes Canadians will do a better job in the tournament than at the world juniors, when it has featured no Canadian team since 2003.

While the prospect of Canadians being able to win the World Cup should motivate Canadian players, Cordell acknowledged that it might not help their long-term prospects playing at the Olympics.

That may seem a strange sentiment in a country that has never failed in the Olympics — though Canadians did earn bronze at the first world junior tournament in 1978, after being eliminated by the Soviets — but Cordell argues that in the event of a serious disaster during the tournament, it would be devastating to all the players.

"To have your best guys playing the national game and then, you know, we're going to a catastrophe and we're going to lose to Russia, it's very sad," he said.

"And what's in it for them? They're not really going to get their opportunity to play in the Olympics to say, 'Listen, I've done what I set out to do. I worked hard for it. I had a good run. My country supported me. I'm on the team. It's been successful for me and I feel the opportunity I have to represent my country.'

"Because I'm a Canadian, I'm really hurt if my people don't support me like they did in the past. It's a really big deal."

======================================== SAMPLE 262 ========================================
The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in two major cases against net neutrality on August 2. Both are the latest in a long history of challenges to broadband internet access, one of the most important features of the internet.

While many people support strong net neutrality rules, few in the telecom and cable industries are arguing publicly that FCC rules shouldn't be imposed. As a result, the next major fight on net neutrality could end up being one of the largest public relations battles in recent years.

It all comes down to a simple question -- is it a violation of net neutrality rules or not? The answer depends on the answer to that question -- and in turn how deeply you believe in the importance of net neutrality rules.

There is an old adage -- you cannot break the law, until you break the internet. That applies to the internet, net neutrality, and the telecom industry. In the case of net neutrality, the law was passed by Congress in 1934 -- before the internet even had a name. It was called the Communications Act, and it is very clear. When FCC rules are imposed on telcos they are illegal -- because they are not the ones who set up the pipes connecting internet to end users. It is up the telcos to build that infrastructure.

The internet was passed on cable from the government in the 1960s, and the early cables were not even powered by electricity. The telcos built them themselves, and maintained them for 30 years. As the internet expanded and more Americans started using it, the telcos found themselves in a position where they had to decide what would become of the internet -- would they be allowed to restrict access to it to subscribers who agreed to pay money?

Many of us know that the answer to that question is no. In the early days of the internet, the telcos were prohibited from doing this, and they have never done it. And it is that ban that we are fighting to overturn today.

Since this is a case that will ultimately end up in the Supreme Court, it is worth reminding people that much of what we know today about net neutrality was not possible until 2011.

This brings us to 2011. In early 2011, a group of tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Netflix, Twitter, Reddit, Kickstarter and Etsy joined forces to form the Internet Association. The intent of the association was to bring more voices into the decision making process and help ensure that these voices were listened to.

The reason this issue is important? In early 2011 there was no such thing as net neutrality.

The question of the day was whether broadband carriers had the right to make the internet inaccessible to some users and enable the full internet to be enjoyed to every Internet user. The answer to that question was no -- until the Internet Association was formed.

But that doesn't mean we should go down the path of banning or restricting broadband access. That has the opposite effect.

As we've seen by the recent fight at the FCC over "Title II," some members of Congress want to make a political issue out of Internet access. Rather than allowing companies like Google and the Internet Association to offer their services, they want to restrict them, essentially making it a utility like cable or phone. The reason we need strong net neutrality is so these decisions do not become "political issues." And in the case of ISP rules, there are already more than enough barriers placed in place to force companies to operate like utilities.

The internet is made up of companies that connect individual users into a global network -- companies like Tumblr, Netflix and the Internet Association. Those companies operate on the strength of their ability to attract users and drive traffic to their websites. So the net neutrality battle at the FCC isn't simply about these three specific companies. Rather, these decisions affect much of the online world. It affects the business models of many other businesses as well, because these decisions affect the ability of ISPs to provide the services companies require.

When the FCC passed its rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking traffic from particular sites or applications or charging content companies for priority access to consumers, the companies that own and operate the networks were worried. The companies argued that these rules would cause them to lose revenues unless they had the ability in some way to influence the FCC's decisions. A few companies have already made it clear that they would be open to taking this route -- with Google, Facebook, Netflix and the rest of the Internet Association in support of a regulatory approach that would allow them to operate as commercial entities.

In terms of net neutrality itself, the Internet Association believes that broadband providers should be able to create an Internet that is open, competitive, and free from discrimination. The key question is whether or not it would violate the 1934 Communications Act to do so.

When people say "neutrality," they are thinking about a standard that allows any company in the world to compete to offer the internet to their customers. But that's actually not what we have today.

A rare super-spy from the Cold War may have been born on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, but his lineage is a fascinating mystery.

U.S. intelligence officials believe a Soviet spy, living under a false name in the United States, secretly worked his way back to the Soviet Union and helped the Cold War super-spy build its network of spies — a vast network that would ultimately lead to a string of high-profile American espionage arrests.

The spy, a Soviet-born engineer, fled the country after the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962. It's believed that he eventually made his way back to Moscow. However, there's been no indication that he was ever caught there.

"This is really, really, really unusual," said Joseph Menn, a senior researcher at the U.S. Department of State in Washington. "It's the only one ... I know of where I can confidently say ... he had no presence at Moscow airport before arriving back in the United States." [Spies of the Cold War: Secret Agents Revealed]

A secret birth in a safe house

U.S. intelligence officials believe Mikhail Gurov was born in 1959 as Boris Volf. This was a highly unusual birth date — Volf was just 15 days old when his mother gave birth. But even more unusual, the United States believes the baby was given up before Volf was born.

The Russian government and many former KGB agents, however, disagree that the baby was abandoned. According to documents from U.S. intelligence documents, the baby was taken in by the KGB in 1958, and raised in the St. Petersburg, Russia, office where he later became a Soviet agent.

A secret birth in a safe house The Soviet Union would not confirm the CIA's findings, but several former KGB officers offered another explanation about Gurov's parentage. According to these documents, the baby had to be abandoned by his family because they feared for his life if they told what they knew about his upbringing.

After returning to the United States, the baby was adopted by a Russian family. In the family registry, his identity was listed as Boris Volf, or Mikhail Gurov, meaning that the KGB knew the child's mother.

It may not have been a secret all along.

"That [KGB] probably knew something was up when [the KGB] got to us that they were able to track down this little Russian," Menn told LiveScience.

The baby's secret

For decades after his family's arrival in the United States, the KGB and Volf kept the secret that the young boy was a Soviet spy.

In the 1970s, while working for a spy ring in Texas, the KGB learned about Gurov's secret. The spy ring was a Russian intelligence network operating in the United States at the time. According to Menn and other experts, an American scientist working with the spy ring, V.V. Chechik, was able to trace the KGB to the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va.

Chechik informed the CIA of the boy's parentage.

During the 1970s, KGB and Gurov kept the secret that the U.S.-born teenager was a Soviet spy The KGB sent a message to Volf informing him that his mother had been in the hospital shortly after giving birth to baby Ivan

The KGB sent a message to Volf alerting him that his mother had been in a hospital before giving birth to baby Ivan.

The KGB would periodically send the message to the girl that was supposed to be his mother, letting her know that the KGB wanted to speak with her and her young, foreign-born son.

Eventually, the KGB even sent the message directly to the young spy's mother. [See photos of a KGB spy's child born in the United States]

"The KGB was very specific and wanted to get Volf's mother," Menn told LiveScience. "It was very clear that this girl was going to have a much bigger role in this story."

The young spy's mother later told U.S. intelligence officials that she saw her son on the cover of a Soviet propaganda magazine called People's Friendship. She said she was not shocked to see the KGB operatives, but was "shocked by the fact that they were trying to get her son."

KGB agents took their message to a former KGB spy, Volf and his girlfriend, with their message being passed through another KGB operative, Vladimir Kuznetsov. In 1970, Volf and his girlfriend visited Chechik at the KGB's office in Virginia. According to the American spy's memoirs, "Boris and Me," he told Volf

When you think of the top-rated fantasy hockey players in fantasy hockey, you'll certainly have some names that come to mind. I mean, guys like Sidney Crosby or Alex Ovechkin. But where do the rest of the players rank? Today, I wanted to take a look at the top 10 fantasy hockey players in ESPN's ESPN standard fantasy draft (or ESPN standard 14 percent draft pool). After finishing up our standard 14 percent draft pool, these were the players that finished 1st or 2nd overall in those pools.

Note: All statistics are taken from NHL.com/Stats.


Here are the top 10 players that I finished first in:

Rank Player Position FGM FGA 1 Jonathan Drouin LW/RW 71 21 2 Nick Foligno C 66 20 3 Corey Perry C/LW 65 19 4 Jonathan Toews RW/LW 65 16 5 Phil Kessel C/LW 64 11 6 Brad Marchand RW 63 9 7 Ryan Johansen C 64 8 8 Patrick Marleau LW/RW 63 7 9 Jason Spezza RW/LW 64 6 10 Nicklas Backstrom C/LW 64 5

Here are the players that I finished second in:

Rank Player Position FGM FGA 1 Jonathan Toews RW 66 7 2 Patrick Kane RW 61 24 3 Corey Perry C/LW 63 20 4 Tyler Seguin RW/LW 61 17 5 Nicklas Backstrom C 61 10 6 Ryan O'Reilly C 61 7 7 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins C 55 12 8 Joe Thornton C 61 7 9 Patrice Bergeron C 59 8 10 Joe Pavelski C 57 11

So there you have it, these were the top fantasy hockey players in ESPN's standard 14 percent draft pool. Let's take a look at which of these players went the furthest (in the reverse order of the overall rankings). So for example, if we looked at who went second in, say, Joe Thornton (who finished 1st), the players who went on to go on to finish 2nd were Patrice Bergeron (1st), Phil Kessel (2nd) and Tyler Seguin (2nd). And so on.

What I would like to see is who went third in, say, Corey Perry, or in this case, the players went on to give the most Fantasy Hockey Points (as defined by the experts) to the players listed below.

The video tells the tale of "Mordor Mac" and how his life changed in an instant when a child molester was caught.

"In the past, our relationship had been pretty good. We were best friends, talking about our little family. It was a very normal relationship. I got a call from a judge and was told 'he's a very good kid.' It was just a normal thing. Now suddenly his life changes a lot! The life of a child molester is a nightmare," says The Til Death!.

But a little child molester could not stop Mordor Mac from finding himself a mother. His own mother. A beautiful, kind and caring woman. She is his one and only mother. But what's a heartless monster to do when your life has changed for the better?

The Til Death! team explains the entire process. All the time he's waiting. They also show Mordor Mac the beautiful woman who will now care for him and make the world a better place.

Last year, the NFL's viewership slipped 1% to a 1.35 rating on NBC and a 2.01 rating on CBS during primetime (down from 1.37 and 2.06). The NFL has been hit hard, and not just because the NFL is getting less money (which is what most media analysts attribute the declines to). Most viewers are turning off the NFL because of off-field issues and a high-profile concussion scandal. But the good news, according to the SportsBusiness Daily, is that the NFL continues to improve in TV ratings (thanks to a resurgence of football on ESPN), digital viewership, and merchandise sales.

The positive news for the NFL shouldn't be surprising:

"While NFL ratings were off significantly from a year ago, the league's overall digital audience was up 17% year-to-year for ESPN and up 4% for CBS—marking a significant growth in digital viewership of the league overall," reads a story titled "NFL Digital Brings It All Together," which appears at SBD. "Of course, a large portion of these viewers watched an NFL game online, which still has an impact on revenues, especially from advertisers."

The good news is that the NFL does still have revenue, and it will continue growing, despite the decline in audience this season. NFL players have been able to negotiate the largest average salary among all professional sports leagues, and the league's revenue from broadcasting and ticket sales is continuing to grow at the rate of a few percentage points per year.

"The most important stat for the league as it heads to negotiations with its national television partners in mid-December is viewership numbers, according to league spokesman Brian McCarthy. He said the league is pleased with the growth in viewership, particularly for ESPN, which showed 7.0 million viewers tuned into the Thanksgiving Day game between the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions, which was the lowest audience for an NFL game in the history of the broadcast."

The problem for the NFL, however, is the growing controversy surrounding the NFL and its mishandling of head injuries. The NFL has recently been rocked by two very well-received independent sports-research studies (not to be confused with the infamous Harvard study, which was never peer-reviewed with the intent of generating more media coverage). One study found that the NFL's tackling rules may actually be contributing more to head injuries than any other rule used in football, another concluded that the NFL's "Deflategate" saga is a conspiracy theory.

The NFL needs to move away from a policy that unfairly and in many cases unintentionally punishes the helmeted hits on quarterbacks who can't help but deliver them.

[The NFL is not currently penalizing helmets when a quarterback throws a football. The problem with this is that the NFL is also "punishing" quarterbacks when they do avoid those hits.]

I've never had much in common with the American president.

He loves a game and a show, likes to be a celebrity at parties and in the spotlight. His style is a bit stiff.

He is very good at making people feel he is a man in black leather and who speaks with an American patois, without the accent.

I've always found him a bit self-obsessed. He's all about a brand and a legacy. And people love him or at least like him.

He is a great salesman, for the record.

It's a difficult line to walk.

But I do have respect for the American president.

And for someone who seems less than self-possessed — more arrogant than anything — at times, he's one of the best salesman.

So it's a challenge: Do I do a deal for him, or not? My gut tells me — because he's a good guy — I have to do it. It's not because I'm going to give the president any favours, it's because on a personal level I'm friends with his daughter. And he's got a very good sense of humour. That can only lead to good things.

I was also worried because there was a lot of talk on TV of him doing deals for me.

Well, they have got me confused — a lot of times. And what I mean by that is that he does me deals.

He wants to buy his own house. He wants to build buildings. He likes hotels — for him.

I don't see him as having a great business acumen. Like the other guy in the Trump International, he makes a deal or doesn't make a deal.

And one of the problems is that it is hard to understand the Trump International. When I got there, I was told that the hotel was doing great — the people liked the hotel. That it was up to par.

And then I would visit there, and it was completely different.

Here's how the hotel looked. Then two years later, I was on the street one day with the president of the company, and everyone was saying, "Wow, how did we do? That's a great hotel." And I'm sitting there with the president of a company and he's saying, "We're doing OK. We're doing real well." The same thing happened when the hotel in Dubai opened — in what looked like an awesome location, and there's nothing great about it. The rooms are not as big, the bathrooms are not as nice as those rooms in Doha, the restaurants are not as fancy as those restaurants in the Trump International. And when the president of the company, whose name I don't even recognize — but they have Trump's name on the building — is saying, "We're doing real well," it's hard to understand how I am supposed to believe him, given the facts.

And in a way, it makes me feel a little bit sorry for the guy, because he's obviously a great salesperson. But he's also been in the private sector, so he's got a tremendous grasp of how it all works.

So I guess the reason I'm still doing business with him — and we'll have a contract — is that I'm a fan.

And I will be a fan for a long time.

Because to me, the president of the United States is a person. He is actually a person, who should be treated by people of all colours, and all ethnicities.

If you can't be a fan of him, or appreciate him — regardless of what you believe about him — you should at least be understanding of why I am a fan.

I'm not talking about the president's politics. I really don't like either of them (or both of them). I don't like either of them at all. But I really do admire these two men for the simple reason that they are simply good people and good at what they do.

I am not the president of the United States, but I am the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. And so, no, I am not a Trump fan and I will not be any more of a Trump fan for a long time.

But Trump still has fans, and I will respect their wishes. For now.

It's not worth offending him by saying no.<|endoftext|>For over 60 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Medical Association (WMA) have been working together to bring the best health information possible to people around the world—a goal that is made much more difficult today.

It's been another disappointing season for the Miami Heat, the result of a roster filled with injuries from the summer, an inexperienced and underused coaching staff and just one winning season in 11 years.

There are reasons why the team finished with the 28th best record of the past 10 seasons. Chris Bosh was sidelined by multiple knee surgeries and the Heat had the fourth-worst 3-point shooting, a result of a lack of shooting. Injuries have held back the Heat too frequently, especially the backcourt, which has been without Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

The Heat have lost 10 of their last 13 games to fall out of the Eastern Conference playoff picture, and that lack of consistency and leadership has gotten in the way of Miami's success.

Miami finished last season with the fifth-worst record in the NBA and the Heat could still miss the playoffs next season if the NBA decides to expand.

The Heat were expected to improve from last season because two of their starters were back, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But their best player in Wade, the NBA's top scorer last season, has been on the injured list every single year since 2006, and the team has had to deal with two knee injuries while trying to develop its third point guard this season in Mario Chalmers, who is not quite as consistent as Wade.

SHARE COPY LINK Miami Heat guard Dion Waiters talks about his recent hamstring injury during Miami Heat media day at American Airlines Arena in Miami.

The Heat traded for veteran point guard Mario Chalmers from Boston on Jan. 2, hoping it would give them stability. However, the injury bug hasn't stopped there.

Wade and Bosh are each working on long-term contracts and each were in line to make millions of dollars next season. Wade has been to every NBA Finals and won two championships, and while Bosh has won the championships, the Heat have not.

Meanwhile, this season's biggest issue was a lack of depth, the lack of any depth at all. The Heat's current depth, including Wade and Bosh, is so bad that it has made winning difficult.

The Heat have just eight players with at least 50 games played this season. Bosh, the team's leading scorer at 17.3 points per game, is on the injured list for another 10th straight game. Wade has missed the last eight games.

In addition, Tyler Johnson and Udonis Haslem, two players who played a combined 15 minutes per game, have returned to the Heat, but it's tough to tell how healthy they will be.

SHARE COPY LINK Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra talks with the media about the team's loss to the Golden State Warriors and the loss of Chris Bosh during the second half of Thursday's game.

And the depth is also hampered by injuries to players who were expected to be major contributors this season. Chris Andersen and Gerald Green, the two centers, have never played more than 18 minutes per game this season and are both playing injured.

That means Tyler Johnson and Josh McRoberts, the two frontcourt players the Heat will have to depend on for depth, started all 82 games last season.

Injuries have a detrimental effect on winning, and the Heat were one of the few teams in the NBA to be without their lead guard or starting point guard at all times this season.

SHARE COPY LINK Tyler Johnson talks about being "100 percent" healthy in the Heat's win against the Charlotte Hornets on December 21, 2014, at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Heat were without Wade for the first 10 games and were without Bosh from March 22 to April 20. They missed their best player and the team's best player for a total of 39 games.

SHARE COPY LINK Miami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra talks about their win against the Charlotte Hornets on December 21, 2014, at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Heat have not been an elite offensive team with Wade and Bosh at the helm. In fact, since 2008, they were last in the NBA in the field goal percentage department, which includes the three-point field goal percentage that the league has traditionally used to measure a player's shooting.

Last season, the Heat were 23rd in the NBA after being 27th last season.

As much as anything else, the Heat's injuries have been a big reason for the disappointing season and why they could miss the playoffs again next year.<|endoftext|>You'll get a chance to chat with J.J.

A "tensile strength test" has been carried out on a 1kg sample of the steel bar used in President Trump's controversial "travel ban" executive order. It suggests it was made in at least six separate US states - though one of those states, Kentucky, told The Verge it doesn't make bars to its own specifications and had nothing to do with Trump's decision.

The T-Rex test is a scientific process that attempts to simulate a variety of conditions such as heat, pressure and time. The first step is to set up an experiment to simulate the impact of a single 1kg piece of steel.

If that impact is sufficiently intense, it can cause the steel to fail — or be "overheated". Under the conditions in Kentucky, the tests were conducted using a high strength (90kg) steel bar that was originally manufactured in Tennessee and shipped via rail to a Kentucky steel mill.

The tests were carried out on an industrial robot.

According to KSPR 6News, the steel at the center of the order was then dropped from a few hundred metres onto a large scale.

The T-Rex is a machine that has three wheels that can measure "pinch point" changes in pressure — the point where a load pushes the material apart slightly. This allows engineers to determine just how much force a piece of steel must have in order to cause it to fail.

The test found that Kentucky steel, though strong under the conditions, could be taken out of service with just a 40kg load, and with a single drop of that force, it would fail.

The T-Rex is a machine that has three wheels that can measure "pinch point" changes in pressure — the point where a load pushes the material apart slightly.

A total of 12 samples were tested and they tested at three different places

It's just one of many similar tests that have been undertaken, suggesting that Trump's order was at least partly based on false assumptions and that the "temperature-stability" of steel is very much in question.

Trump's executive order temporarily banned entry to the US by citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations. While some legal cases are being heard to challenge the order, many are defending it by saying that it was based on a need to protect Americans from terrorism.

According to PolitiFact, "Only a handful of courts" have issued rulings over the past several years backing the idea that the ban violates the constitution.

It's not the first time Trump has been put on the spot over the strength of his products. Earlier this year, he said that Apple products were made in China. That claim was investigated and found to be false when it was shown that they were made in California.<|endoftext|>If you are an experienced woodworker and have been collecting woodchips and woodworking equipment for many years, why bother making one of these amazing wood crafts? Why not use modern technology like software to automate the processes? Why waste hours working or spending hours on the woodworking bench only to be frustrated as the wood comes out unfinished, or that the project fails to make your heart sing? It's easier to make a simple hand carved carved wooden sculpture which makes your heart sing and you feel great doing it. And if you are a beginner who wants to start building that one handmade wooden sculpture in your room that your heart will start beating and you will start thinking about how to make one next, then I am glad to help you to make that sculpture that your heart will start beating so much that your whole body will feel the excitement and happiness you feel when you create a masterpiece.

This article is not dedicated to anyone who is just starting out with woodcrafting and is just coming to the point of wanting to buy a woodworking tool. This article is designed for people who have tried but have not been successful so far in creating their own handmade wooden sculptures. You can easily make them as described in this article using simple woodworking tools, and I have compiled a list of very useful woodworking materials you can acquire with the help of some helpful sources provided below.

Woodworking Tools

A set of a chisel, a file, and a sanding wheel is required to make your project easily. If you have some good quality carving wheels, then you can easily get free wheels from a lot of sources which are available on the web.

A saw with a fine and smooth blade is also absolutely invaluable for carving wooden projects.

In addition to the woodworking tools mentioned above, I would recommend you to get yourself a good pair of manual and power tools. Your hands get sore and blistered when you have to use power tools, and you also get sore if you do not use the necessary amount of strokes, and you might even get a sore arm if you are in an outdoor environment and have to use your tools outdoors. A good quality, hand carving carving tool and an old hand saw will give you all the benefits described above

"The fact that we're going down there to kill ISIS, the Russians are on our side. And we are going to kill as many of them as we can, and there's nothing anybody can do about it," Trump told the Christian Broadcast News.

Trump didn't specify how many ISIS fighters he would send to the region, however his comments may be related to another strategy he announced last week.

On Sept. 3, 2016, Trump tweeted: "We should just cancel the elections and just make America great again." He repeated the sentiment a few days later.

"The elections are absolutely rigged," he wrote on Sept. 28. "The media is making it very difficult but I will tell you, I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged — I have to be honest. I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged by crooked media."

The Washington Post reported that Trump is referring to what he has described as "the media bias" against him — an accusation the media denied.

What Trump did not address, however, was how the "unrigged" election would take shape.<|endoftext|>A new documentary film has put the focus on one controversial aspect of the U.S. military's post-9/11 counterterrorism strategy - the way in which it uses 'credible threat' to justify the assassination of al-Qaida and other extremists. The program, produced by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, The Intercept claims, shows that the U.S. government has relied on a legal process that allows them to kill American citizens on U.S. soil at will with little scrutiny. In an interview with The Huffington Post, one of the people featured in the film, John Kiriakou, says the process has allowed U.S. citizens targeted for assassination to be tortured before being killed.

"One of the things Americans may not be aware of is that the executive branch has a special legal regime that allows the executive branch to kill American citizens without ever getting a trial, based on this so-called 'credible threat' standard," Kiriakou (pictured above) said. He believes that the government is using terror tactics it learned from Al Qaeda.

SPONSORED

"That's the definition of a war crime," he said.

The Intercept reported that Kiriakou's film, in part, explores how the CIA used what it learned about Osama bin Laden after 9/11 to target people that it thought was a threat to the United States.

Kiriakou, a former CIA case officer, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for disclosing classified information to journalists, including a "black site" code-named "Salt Pit."

Although he was never charged with a crime over the classified information, Kiriakou says he believes the CIA should be held accountable.

"I hope the U.S. government will investigate and hold people accountable who did this. That's what it would be if they didn't get away with it that is why I'm speaking out," Kiriakou said.

The government, however, maintains that the 'credible threat' program does not authorize targeted killings on U.S. soil.

In a statement to The Intercept, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justified the use of the terrorism-related law known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by arguing that the government needs to protect "the nation from terrorist activity abroad if it knows or reasonably should know" that an individual has been involved in terrorist activities at home.

While the program is designed to target those responsible for domestic terrorist activity, government officials also use it to spy on American citizens and others believed to be tied to foreign terrorists.

"The use by US government officials of the national security 'credible threat' framework, which allows US officials to target foreign terrorists who may be traveling abroad but have connections in the United States, as a means of preventing and/or disrupting terrorist attacks within the United States is consistent with US national security interests and the Constitution," a 2007 ruling by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel explained.

The U.S. government also used the program under President George W. Bush to detain and torture al-Qaeda suspects (including Anwar Awlaki) without charges or due process.

Former President Barack Obama used the program without approval. He told a reporter that the program allowed the government to go "after folks who are very dangerous."

The ACLU notes that when al-Qaeda was at its height, "it posed an imminent threat to the country that did not exist in 2001."

"The Obama administration has made the assassination of a citizen the cornerstone of its counterterrorism policy, despite this historical omission as well as the clear law prohibiting it," said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement.<|endoftext|>1. How much for a game of pool?

HSSB637: The people of Dragon Bone Mountain, they've done everything

Yan Zhaoge and Ah Hu were currently looking to the west of the Dragon Bone Mountain with their respective eyes, and they immediately saw that a massive mountain had appeared.

The enormous mountain, which seemed to be formed of a single layer of solid earth, was covered with jade-like patterns on the surface. Its upper region was filled with jade that looked as if it could easily be melted into powder by the light of the sun.

The lower region of the mountain was filled with deep blue light as well, and was more suited for cultivators of qi-bearing martial arts rather than others.

The jade patterns of the upper region was very dense, while those on the lower regions were comparatively weak.

In the distance, the black sky of the Great Western Desert lay far back, and in the distance appeared as numerous streaks of clear white clouds as well.

Yan Zhaoge and Ah Hu gazed at the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation that was not far away with their great livers as they pondered.

Their understanding of the Great Western Desert's current state was extremely clear to their hearts.

However, in the next moment, something strange occurred.

Yan Zhaoge looked over once more at the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation before him, "So that was the real Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation?"

He raised his head, "Ah Hu, you can't be too rash. That's merely the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation of the Eight Extremities World."

As he spoke, Yan Zhaoge took out the Jade Dragon Sword from his Sacred Talisman Pouch, his eyes glancing towards the skies above, "This is still only the Grand Formation of the Eight Extremities World, but at that time, Grand Master of the Heavenly Thunder Hall, Zhou Xuan who was the Heavenly Thunder Hall's Chief of the Eastern Tang did not know whether he was the first person or the last person to see the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation that had already been born."

"In the end, he had already lost to you, Elder Xu here who was the first who had discovered it. So, it seems that not only should we know of the grand formation from those of you who have fought, but also from those who did not. And what should we do afterwards?"

Ah Hu blinked, "We shouldn't have thought that having already used so many thunder dragons would be able to make him give this up, and that this grand formation would only be something this big."

Yan Zhaoge smiled without answering, "The only conclusion is that he hasn't thought through the consequences, and didn't think of a way to oppose us."

Ah Hu looked at him, pondering, seemingly unable to believe his words.

Yan Zhaoge laughed, "You can't say that, if we didn't plan and act, you could have still been lost in the mountains with the Sacred Artifact."

Ah Hu patted his back, "Elder Xu is also a Heavenly Thunder Hall martial practitioner after all,"

Yan Zhaoge nodded, "Then you should do as I plan and let us go, otherwise you are just going to keep paying for that."

Ah Hu nodded resolutely before turning to leave.

Yan Zhaoge saw this and instantly laughed, "Then don't say that anymore."

Looking at the massive Jade Sea Grand Formation which had appeared right in front of them, a cold light flashed within Yan Zhaoge's eyes, "The Great Eight Extremities World also has the Dragon Bone Mountain in its East Sea. If we want to leave, we first need to break through here."

"But at the moment, as well as it being an Extreme Northern Sect's stronghold, it already belongs to Jade Sea City."

"There is still the Heavenly Thunder Hall's Chief of the Eastern Tang, Elder Xu, also the previous opponent of our Broad Creed Mountain, the late Elder He Ning, not to mention that that Heavenly Thunder Hall's Chief of the Eastern Tang also happens to be not only our Sacred Sun Clan's Elder Crane, but also Jade Sea City's Eldest Martial Brother, the current Chief of the Heavenly Thunder Hall and a Martial Saint expert.

In the end, this Jade Sea City must be very much alarmed by me, but after I left Broad Creed Mountain, Jade Sea City did not attack you,"

Yan Zhaoge shook his head with a laugh, "The reason why the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation of the Eight Extremities World has appeared over here is precisely for this reason."

From being able to obtain this grand formation once, Jade Sea City was already very happy, "We also have a reason for this grand formation, otherwise how would such a grand formation come into being so suddenly

The new 'Rise' trailer from 'The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim' features the return of new and returning Skyrim characters as well as the game's new features.

The official 'Rise' trailer debuted on April 1 with Skyrim returning for its second year and will feature familiar faces from the game as well as new faces and a number of new features.

Skyrim featured a number of new additions as well, including an ability to turn the landscape into a snowy wasteland, new clothing, and a few new quests. There are also new monsters like skeletons and spiders, among other things, and it looks like there will be plenty to see throughout the trailer.

In Skyrim, players control both the story and dialogue for the game. That story is now told from a few different points of view. If your character starts with the new guard dog, named Forte, he will have a story to tell. If the Dragonborn is starting new, they'll have their own "story." The game's first half can be played from several different points of view, and the second half is played without seeing the Dragonborn's point of view.

New to the blog? Welcome.

We've been busy over the past few months. We've made tremendous strides in our goal to be a strong independent game developer, with a diverse set of skills, and many people from both the indie scene and industry. We've been fortunate to come into close contact with such a large and supportive community, and have been encouraged by the feedback. In a few weeks, we'll be moving our focus away from alpha to a public, alpha-testing stage, where everyone can play the game and give us feedback. We believe in the final product and what it means for us and our team. You can read more about that on our announcement post here.

We're so excited for the changes, but our development isn't over. We're working on a few small side projects, including a visual novel. We started writing this in April, and we're not going to be fast on it, or finished in time to release it at PAX East. As with everything else in development, please bear with us.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a mission 'to seek fundamental knowledge of physical disorders and their causes', but at the same time there is also a need for it to move quickly in order to deliver research results in time to help the public. This is why the NIH recently created the Strategic Research Initiative for Translational Research (STRI-T) to accelerate the pace of basic biomedical discovery. STRI-T will provide an opportunity for the NIH director to focus on key translational translational research topics and accelerate progress in these areas. The following is a short list of what STRI-T will focus on:

Advanced Genomic technologies

Complexity-based medicine

Drug discovery

Interventional genetic research

Biomedical engineering

Biomedical innovation and entrepreneurship

The Strategic Research Initiative for Translational Research initiative has five objectives and five funding plans that will help advance biomedical innovation:

Develop an ambitious five year plan that will establish and accelerate an ambitious strategy for NIH research.

Support a new strategic plan to accelerate progress on STRI-T's five overarching objectives and funding plans.

Fund STRI-T and other NIH-funded translational research for the next five years.

Promote and support the development of translational research centers through a new NIH institute for translational research.

Enhance scientific leadership and coordination of STRI-T.

Strengthen the strategic framework with a strategic plan for strategic planning.

Strategic Research Initiative for Translational Research (STRI-T)

The current strategic framework for STRI-T will include an eight year strategic plan; five overarching objectives, including four new initiatives and three new mechanisms for supporting and executing on these.

NIH Director Francis S. Collins plans to support STRI-T with a $5 million new program through the Office of the Director's Research and Development (ORDER). Within the new program will be $4.2 million for the Strategic Research Initiative for Translational Research to advance the NIH Research Vision for Translational Research.

NIH has also created a new organization, STRI-T-Tribeca (STRU-T), to support the coordination of STRI-T and other NIH-funded translational research projects. STRU-T will be headed by NIH senior staff and will work to support translational research as well as accelerate progress in the NIH Research Vision for Translational Research. In addition, STRU-T will be responsible for developing new tools and technologies that could be part of the STRI-T portfolio of strategies.

As part of the new initiative, the NIH plans to invest $6.5 million to encourage the adoption of novel biological tools and technologies. This will be in addition to the $4 million in funding that has been committed directly over the last three years.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) will support the new initiative by making available new grants to support these efforts. In addition, NSF will also support the development of new strategies to support these activities.

The current eight-year strategic framework for STRI-T is expected to be completed within fiscal year 2012; however, if funding is not identified, the framework will continue through FY 2016. For more information, visit the new STRI-T website at www.strio.nih.gov.

Biography

2013

At the age of 13 (2 October 2006), Korean prodigy Kim "" Chae joined Garena in March 2007, joining the very young team (now known as Team Coast) known as the KOO Tigers. He left for China before Garena merged with the LGD organization, joining the newly formed LGD Gaming at age 17.

2014 Season

After a poor performance at the World Cyber Games, LGD disbanded, but Kim kept playing with the new team CLG and won their first game of the spring split, on March the 2nd. But after CLG finished the split in 2nd place after a tiebreaker loss to TSM, Kim left the team, citing pressure from the new organization.

2015 Season

Before new sponsor Immortals acquired the CLG roster, Kim briefly joined Team Coast as their jungler, and was replaced by former Curse AD carry Brandon "Saintvicious" DiMarco. After their first week with Saintvicious, however, Kim left the team saying that he was unhappy with his teammates and didn't play well enough.[1] He returned a short while later. In the summer split, CLG was the #3 seed in the regular season, only to be defeated 3-0 in the first round by Team Dragon Knights. That loss eliminated them

But that hasn't stopped Iran's clerical hardliners from claiming the agreement is in violation of U.S. national interests and that President Trump should reconsider his decision to make a deal with a tyrant-ruled regime that has long oppressed its own people.

President Trump has said Iran has violated the agreement because of its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad — the same regime responsible for the most egregious violations of the agreement.

"I must tell you that the recent terrorist attack in Iran, which killed over 25 people, some of them were killing innocent people — the most beautiful people, innocent children, innocent babies," Trump told reporters in August. "Those people were killed by the Iranian government."

On Monday, the conservative website Daily Beast published what it called "evidence" that the Iranian regime is responsible.

"Iran is supporting the Islamic State terrorist group," The Beast wrote. "In addition, according to recently declassified intelligence from U.S. officials, Iran was behind a series of attacks on U.S. government personnel, including the killing of the American contractor and a Navy SEALS member in August 2016."

The publication, which cited "a veteran U.S. intelligence official familiar with some of the documents" said the documents "show how Iran has continued to support its Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in the fight against the Islamic State and Syrian rebels who are fighting both the regime and various terrorist groups."

There is no evidence Iran is supporting ISIS. The Daily Beast did not respond to TheDC's questions about the documents' source.

A July Washington Times article headlined, "Iran's terrorist allies: How the U.S. fell for a regime change," said a series of former U.S. intelligence officials said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got so confused about Iran's role in terrorism that she "tried to pin the blame for the deadly attacks in Paris and San Bernardino for Iran's government."

When asked to explain her confusion, Clinton told reporters in October she was in "constant touch with our allies around the world and in a series of private phone calls" about the attacks.

The Washington Times said the Trump White House made Iran's alleged terrorist activity the centerpiece of its Iran deal negotiating strategy. And the Trump administration did not object to a $100 billion arms deal with Tehran last week that would give it more funds.

The Washington Times said it "found no evidence that the Obama administration objected to this deal. But it also did not find evidence that Trump officials did, either."

The State Department issued a statement, which was also published on The Daily Beast's website, rejecting the allegations.

"The State Department has been in regular contact with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and the government of Iran regarding Iran's role as a leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world today," the statement read. "As we have said repeatedly, since the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in July 2015, Iran's violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action have not been significant enough to warrant termination of the deal."

The statement also said that "if there is evidence that Iran has violated the agreement, we reserve the right to assess and take further action."

A senior Iran expert for a think tank that favors a better deal said the State Department's comments didn't address the substance of the story.

In case you missed it, on September 15, 2015, on-site security officials with the Israeli government (and not Israeli citizens) will be arrested by the FBI for entering the US Embassy illegally, in order to take pictures.

This is the latest in a long line of arrests in recent years for similar and usually illegal activities by Israeli government officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally ordered this particular arrest in 2012. So it's no coincidence that the arrest happened on the same day as the State of the Union address.

This is an incredible escalation, and I don't think anyone's really given it much thought. Yet every single one of these situations has a clear point:

1) The US government is desperately in need of more surveillance and more control over the Internet, particularly on the part of the NSA/FBI. They're working harder at it than ever, because surveillance keeps getting harder and harder. When it comes to the FBI, the best way to get them to stop spying on the US public is to publicly humiliate them. I suspect that's their motivation here.

2) The US government, and especially the FBI, is very, very scared of the Internet. And very, very desperate.

3) People are going to die.

It was a strange way to start what was supposed to be a great election week. The election didn't have to get in the way of these arrests (and it certainly could not have been used as an excuse to ramp up the war on terror); they could have easily delayed them. Instead, US government officials were not only arrested but the Israeli government was also, which I think says a lot about the kind of people who are running things.

It's also a sign that we now have a world where the state and the companies who run it are both more afraid of Internet freedom than anyone could imagine. And those companies also know it.

It might be going to a concert, or going to see a movie, or visiting some other attraction (the library, for instance).

This year, however, I went to see some things that I never thought I would see in my life—a Star Wars Celebration Europe panel.

I was not on the list of panelists, but after meeting the crew who organized it—the guys from Rebel Force Radio and the Rebel Galaxy blog—I was asked to do a bit of a "pre-show" for the crew that would be on the flight, so that I could make sure I heard the panel from the start.

In case you just want to read it, be forewarned that it's super long and ruddy long.

I'd give a few bits from my chat with the crew, but the real excitement came when I began to get a glimpse into those behind the scenes at Star Wars Celebration. It was amazing. So many people, people I'd only heard about now, working like mad to make sure nothing gets ruined and every minute of experience at the convention comes out just right. It's incredible.


Some background of the guys behind the scenes:

RFR has an interesting backstory. They started almost four and a half years ago with their first episode in which they did a lot of interviews with Star Wars creators, as well as talking to some of the people who know the most about the original series. After this, they have done a number of videos.

And then there are the blog posts.

A few years ago, RFR got the attention of a bunch of big time StarWars fans who were into reading and keeping updated. And this year, Star Wars Celebration Europe is actually where this came about. You can see the original "Star Wars: In Memoriam" video on the site here—and here's a longer version that has all the quotes.

And they have a couple of books as well, including "The Original Trilogy: A Compendium," which has all of the original Star Wars books, written by some of the key people who helped make this thing happen. You can check that out here.

And for those who don't know, Rebel Force Radio is RFR's spin-off podcast. It covers all things Star Wars.

RFR and the Rebel Galaxy blog have become a great place to follow some of the people behind the scenes. For the most part, they do a great job. They've done an interview with J.J. Abrams—again, a great source on the behind-the-scenes people. They've done "Behind the Screen" videos about The Force Awakens and Rogue One.

For some of the other stuff, though, their work is just amazing. This site has been around since 2011, but they have some really great stories. One time,

In a recent press conference, the new President of the Philippines made a shocking announcement. He intends to abolish the military. He also promised to send the military into Mindanao for "security". But the truth is that the Philippines' military does not have any legitimate business in Mindanao.

Philippines' military is a creation of the United States. The first president to establish the military presence in the Philippines was Franklin Roosevelt. The Philippine constitution mandates the establishment of a military to protect the nation's security. However, the constitution also states that the military not engage in "invasive activities".

In fact, as far back as 1946, President Manuel Quezon explained, under the Philippine constitution, any interference by the United States in the affairs of the country would be referred back to the Philippines. In other words, the Constitution mandates the independence of the Philippines from the United States and in keeping with the spirit of independence, there should not be any military presence in the country.

In reality, the military is a tool of U.S. foreign policy. It was the U.S. government which decided to bring the military into the Philippines, not the Filipino people.

The Philippine people have resisted the U.S. occupation in the past and they should be allowed to do the same now.

The Philippine military must protect Philippine sovereignty, not Philippine sovereignty must be protected by the Philippine military.

It was the U.S. government which decided.

The Philippines is a sovereign nation and no longer under the rule of the U.S.

The Filipino people must have their own sovereign nation, and not be subject to U.S. imperialism.

The Philippines has repeatedly expressed its desire for an independent foreign government, and in fact has been demanding it since the time of the Manila Treaty of 1898.

If this treaty can be so easily overturned by an imperialist power seeking control over the Philippines, how much sovereignty are the Philippine people to be granted in the 21st century when the U.S. government can act as "The Government of Uncle Sam" with impunity?

The reality is that if the Manila Treaties are not upheld the Philippines will be "colonized"…as the term is used by Professor Jose Maria Sison of the University of the Philippines. This is very similar to what the United States is doing with Iraq through their "liberation" of that country.

The Philippines will be "colonized", "colonized" over, and that means being controlled by the same foreign imperialist entity which has previously colonized that country. But that is what these two examples do, if not this, then with the same, or substantially the same, imperialist entity.

So, by ending the US treaty on the bases and the U.S. military presence in the Philippines the U.S. has already broken the spirit of the Manila Treaty and they have taken a major step to bring about the subjugation of the Philippines.

Furthermore, the Philippines is the only Southeast Asian country the U.S. does not have military bases in. The Philippine government needs to take all available steps to restore peace in Mindanao, to ensure that the military is no longer used.

The U.S. should no longer have any bases in the Philippines and this means the end of the Philippines' colonial past.

Over the past three years, the U.K. has been suffering from an unprecedented financial crisis that saw the nation's banks collapse under the weight of the collapse of a housing bubble. Today, the Conservative-appointed British government has announced a plan to make sure that when the economic winds eventually shift over the next few years, the country will be ready to welcome the world by offering its citizens the best possible education at the best possible price. They'll also have free health care coverage as well as some of the best transportation facilities in its size.

Fossils and other data that shed light on the evolutionary histories of the major groups of organisms are an increasingly important source of information about biological and evolutionary processes. In this paper we apply the same methods that were used to analyze fossil DNA sequences to estimate the divergence time and demographic history of the great apes relative to the other apes. Our results show that the great apes are the most divergences-rich lineage of all the ape and human lineages.

Abstract

Fossils, living individuals, and even their genome sequences are valuable tools for elucidating the evolutionary histories of lineages. The relationships between the great apes, with their well-documented hominoid–hominin evolutionary relationships, are of particular interest. The current estimates of divergence times and demographic histories of major ape- and human-groupings are primarily derived from analyses of DNA sequences or paleontological data, but these tools can be highly imprecise. The method we use takes advantage of the difference between molecular data and genetic data, in particular the information that has been removed prior to the assembly of the species-specific sequences. This removes the most informative portions of the genetic sequences, leaving a sequence with as few and as divergent nucleotide base pairs as possible. We estimate the age of the greatest extant gorilla ancestor (Gorilla gorilla) at 50.3 ± 1.2 Ma and that of the great ape ancestor (Pan troglodytes) at 49.8±0.6 Ma. For both species, the oldest dated specimens are at least 50 Kya. By removing the most informative portions of the DNA sequences, we show that the great apes are the most divergences-rich lineage of the vertebrate trees of life. We also estimate that the great apes are descendants of a single ancestral species; the gorilla-lineages are therefore divergences-rich even though they are members of one genus.<|endoftext|>I don't know the name of the game, but it's the only one with me and my roommate playing it together.

How can I play this with friends?

Are there any rules?

Do I need the game installed on my mac or can I just download it from the app store and open it?

How long are the mini versions of the games?

How does the multiplayer work?

What should I do if I get disconnected and will I still lose the games and progress if I don't rejoin after a minute?

There is a couple of issues with multiplayer. If you are playing with more than 2 people, you will see 3-4 disconnections a game. Even once you reconnect, it will restart from where you were. If this happens to you multiple times, you can try re-downloading the game and trying to join a different game.Also, each person gets to choose the same map, so it might take you awhile to discover the best maps to play with your friends. I suggest you just try them and if they are good, then keep playing them until someone else suggests a better one. Or you can make up one if you hate the previous maps.If you play on a computer with more than 6GB of RAM (which I do not recommend) then you may have some performance problems. We didn't have these on our mac which was upgraded from 8GB of RAM to 16GB. For this reason I recommend you wait a couple of weeks and see if your computer is as much as you wish it to be.The mini version of this games can lag your computer. If you have a mac that is a little older, or doesn't follow the recommended hardware requirements, this would really be an issue. This can be fixed by running a program called the game's monitor in administrator mode.You can run the program and it will start up the full version of the game.If you need to be the admin to run the monitor, or just feel like it, you can try this:Just be sure to save and exit the application when you're done.<|endoftext|>This is a list of all of Al Gore's speeches, speeches written for him, and speeches and speeches written for his team.

I recently was able to work on a project in the Clojure ecosystem and came across some really cool features for immutable data structures. One thing that got my attention was how immutable data structures use a different API than other data structures like maps or sets. The core data structure is still a vector or a pair or a map, but it does it in a very specific way.

It may be easier to understand this new API in relation to Clojure's lazy evaluation strategy. Clojure has one of these which uses fn :

(fn [x] (x))

So to use it we would write the following in Clojure code:

(map #(iter % 2 ))

fn is really powerful when it comes to immutable data structures. When it evaluates nothing it won't modify anything:

(set/inc 1 ) #(println % 2 )

fn on the other hand evaluates its result every time to get a new value.

We'd still use map here with set :

(map #(set % 2 ))

The difference is very subtle. The first one just iterates over its elements while the second one just sets each element to its successor.

However there are some differences:

Immutable data structures have some other important differences.

When we think about immutable data structures it's difficult to tell them from other data structures because we expect them to be different. But it's helpful in understanding how Clojure's immutability works.

For example when you've used Clojure for a while you may have seen one of these data structures in action.

I won't delve deep into the details of those data structures, but let me know if you have better references.

One of those Clojure data structures is a vector, which is used to store numbers. Here's a vector:

Vec< Integer > { 1 2 3 4 }

You've probably seen similar things in other languages. They may have a range of all positive numbers, or a bit field with a specific value:

public BitSet< Integer > max = new BitSet<> (); public BitSet< Integer > min = new BitSet<> ();

In Clojure vectors don't do anything like all those things.

Clojure maps are like tuples:

( def maps ( comp

( fn [m]

( let [x ( first m)]

( clojure.lang.IRedgeMap/coll ( next ( conj x m))))))

maps)

And they have a similar API:

( def maps ( comp

( fn [m]

( let [m ( first m)]

( clojure.lang.IRedgeMap/coll m))))

maps)

However maps is what Clojure uses all the time for storing arrays and maps.

The Clojure map API is pretty simple in many ways:

Vars map maps maps map maps maps maps maps 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ( ns foo ( :require [clojure.string :as str])) ( str/join ( map #( str %)) ( str/join ( map #( str %) %)) "..." )) 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ( ns foo ( :require [clojure.string :as str])) ( str/join ( map #( str %) %) ( str/join ( map #( str %) %) %)) "..." ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ( ns foo ( :require [clojure.string :as str])) ( str/join ( map #( str %) %) ( str/join ( map #( str %) %) %)) "..." )

Here we set a number onto the first element of maps. The maps maps are defined in terms of a vector. So the :as is the type parameter in Str's clojure.string/join function.

The Clojure map API, because it's a map, can be converted to vector! The conversion works exactly the same as the one in Str's clojure.string/join functions.

This feature isn't just for vectors. It's also used for maps in Clojure's collection API!

To see this in action, we look at Clojure's filter function:

( filter #( str %) ( str/join % "..." )) 1 2 3 ( filter #( str %) ( str/join % "..." ))

So if we want to find all occurrences of "hello world" in the string "... world..." we could do:

( str/join "..." ( filter #( str %) "..." )) "..." 1 2

You might remember when the first "Ghostbusters" reboot, "Ghostbusters: The Video Game," was announced. You might know that you can pre-order the game on Amazon for $39.99 or at Walmart for $29.99. Or maybe you did a Google search on the phrase "Ghostbusters: The Video Game" and saw that its developers at Double Fine actually made a game about the movie that's on the DVD, "Ghostbusters: The Video Game." (It seems pretty obvious then, that the game includes a short movie starring Bill Murray, Leslie Jones, and the rest of the "busters", which is why it's included in the original box-set of 'Theatrical Releases.')

"Ghostbusters: The Video Game" is scheduled for a June 2016 release on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 4, and is already available for pre-order on Amazon. It also looks pretty nice for a game about Ghostbusters.

I don't know a whole lot about the game, since I've just seen a trailer, but here's a quick peek at its first gameplay trailer. It looks pretty cool, too, so if you want to pre-order it, do it now.

The latest installment in the "Ghostbusters" movie franchise was released in theaters and video stores over the summer and, in fact, opened over $70 million of its $144 million budget domestically. It continues to do well overseas as well. The film itself will eventually roll out on Blu-Ray and DVD later this year.

So if you're a big fan of this iconic franchise, you'll probably want to give "Ghostbusters: The Video Game" a chance. It won't be for everyone, but if you like comedy, you might just like it.

In April, the U.S. State Department issued a similar letter to the state. This month's announcement from the Department of Education in the name of fighting "discrimination" and "religious exemption" is the most sweeping.

A federal law requires all schools to file reports to the Department for a four-year period beginning in 2015. For the 2015-16 school year, that means schools will have to file reports on the following issues:

-- admissions and retention practices.

-- the gender balance among applicants in the applicant pool.

-- the amount of scholarships for women, and

-- the number of gender non-conforming students.

The state of California in its annual report to the federal Department of Education says that of all its schools that meet the Title IV of the law, only 6 percent comply with those reporting rules.

For California's high schools, where roughly 90 percent of students attend private, religious schools, the rules are likely to be tougher.

"This is a very important step to ensure gender-inclusive educational opportunities," said Kimberely A. Esparza, the Department of Education's deputy undersecretary of education. "These new rules are critical to ensuring that all schools follow Title IV policies that are consistent with their religious missions."

"The Obama administration went out of its way to ensure that Title IV compliance was a top priority," Esparza added. "Our commitment to ensuring that all schools are providing equitable educational opportunities and opportunities for girls and women remains unwavering."

But the state has yet to release some of the information students must disclose if they are considering getting in to one of the roughly 500 private high schools that receive federal funding in California.

The U.S. Department of Education has sent letters to several private schools in California asking that they be disclosed the numbers of girls and boys admitted to the school per the school's enrollment trends.

This is an obvious indication that the admissions standards for schools like private high schools vary greatly.

The schools are not required to release the percentage of girls or boys admitted and must describe the percentage admitted separately if they do publish that data.

One private high school in suburban San Diego asked the department for the percentage of boys in the applicant pool relative to the percentage of girls. The school said the applicant pool is about 60 percent males and 40 percent females.

According to the state, the student body is about 70 percent male, 20 percent female and 13 percent intersex, or both. In California, many high schools are mixed gender.

An online article published in the San Diego Union-Tribune last year suggests the numbers are even lower. One story suggested that only a quarter of boys in one of San Diego's top school district schools are in the senior class.

It may be some alternate world we never even found out about, with the rules and rules we never saw.

This world we live in, and the way we live in it makes my father's old beliefs about ghosts and the universe seem a bit naive now. I find myself wishing he would have stopped being a father when I started feeling like my father. I wish he would have been a ghost who wanted nothing more than to be free. And he wasn't, now was he? Is my husband my ghost or is he just my husband? Or what is his relation to me in the first place? Is he even a man? Is he a ghost? Is my husband my ghost? I know my husband is a ghost, but I never knew my father to be one. That question has hung heavy in the back of my mind for years, since he died. There is no one else who will answer those questions. I've tried to convince myself that I'm not a ghost. And while I could be wrong, why should I stop trying? If you can't see how wrong this is, you're not the kind of person who could keep up with me if you did. I am not allowed to look any further than my current situation. All that is out of my control. All that does matter right now is my husband, and his needs. He's not perfect, obviously, and is still struggling with his demons. I could never understand what made my father do this. So what is my husband's fault? Is he always this kind, and needs to be loved unconditionally? Is he always this needy that he has to be taken care of? I know that my life is not as stable as his, and that he's not always there when I need him and that makes me feel so useless and unworthy. I don't know how I would cope with this. But I know there is no other option. What options do I have? I've thought about asking my husband to leave me for a while now. But as I sit here, curled up in the soft blankets of my bed and my eyes half-closed, I think he doesn't want to. He would not leave me. I don't blame him though. It's his choice whether to stay. I don't blame him. But I can't stay either. I tried to write "No One" a while back, but didn't quite get anywhere. Then I started thinking about it a lot, and realized I never got to finish writing it. I never had the courage to try again, or the motivation, which is why this fanfiction was never finished. This has been a real gift, really. Thanks, Stolen_from_my_Puppy_Cage. It means the world to me that you took the time to read a few lines of a fanfiction. I mean, it's not like you've read any fanfiction of your own. But I think you'll find that "No One" is very, very true.<|endoftext|>Cancer and Reproductive Harm- Cancer and Reproductive Harm- www.P65Warnings.ca.gov

The Ohio-class nuclear attack submarine is expected to carry the new name in ceremonies to be held in Newport News, Virginia, and at the submarine pier later in May.

At a ceremony on May 10, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus will award the new name to the first Submarine School submarine as part of a series of ceremonies designed to celebrate America's nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

While the name may change, the submarine service's motto of "Dare to do the Impossible" remains.

In February, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) announced that the first of four West Virginia-class submarines under construction had been delivered to its shipyard at

If you've ever heard someone say: "I've always been a Liberal, but in 2014 I realised I disagree with the Liberal Party of Australia", then you may be inclined to be a tad confused.

It'd seem that we're at the point where most Australian political parties think it's perfectly acceptable for members to change their mind about a major issue such as same-sex marriage while in federal parliament, just like members are now expected to change their vote on a budget bill while in the Senate. But why?

Is it just to try and increase voter turnout or to win more seats in the Senate?

The answer lies in the 'closet Liberal', a name given to a person who consistently votes for the Liberal party but secretly disapproves of the Liberal Party and its policies.

In Australia this would be more commonly known as an "independents vote" politician.

This week Labor senator Sam Dastyari was caught out on Twitter by an online video in which he called one of his constituents "Gayby".

"Gayby. I believe you're a f***ing pr**k," one comment quoted.

As is so often the case, things took a turn for the worse and he was forced to resign from the shadow defence team.

It's easy to understand why Mr Dastyari decided to quit. His comment was obviously indefensible and in light of this we have to wonder whether this man is truly "too liberal".<|endoftext|>Futuristic 'Hollywood' to open in 2017

Hollywood's "Viva Las Vegas" movie billboard will be visible from the top of San Francisco's Embarcadero and its tony Mission District this weekend, after an elaborate three-month renovation project cost at least $7 million, state officials have announced.

It has been in the works since the first film trailer for "Viva Vegas," starring Brad Pitt, went online more than a year ago.

"Viva Las Vegas" is the third installment of a Hollywood series that began as an homage to the Las Vegas Strip. In recent years the "Viva Vegas" series has been known for its high-concept style of filmmaking.

The new set has a futuristic design, with a digital display board that is on a track of concrete. The Hollywood sign features large digital video of the stars, a large sign reading "Hollywood" and an oversized replica of a jet, complete with its wings.

"Viva Las Vegas" will open on Feb. 24 at the Alameda County Fairgrounds and on the following weekends March 25-26, May 24-26 and Sept. 11-12 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, officials say.

The Alameda County Fairgrounds is located at the southern entrance to the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge.

A man wielding his gun and ordering another to leave a McDonald's restaurant died from "multiple gunsfire" and was a convicted felon, authorities said.

Investigators believe the wounded man was the aggressor because he was armed and also because he was in the restaurant at the time of the early-morning attack Saturday.

The victim, identified as 54-year-old William Ahern of Brooklyn, was found shot at 3 a.m. in the parking lot near an intersection, police reported. His injuries included multiple gunshot wounds. A spokesman for the Nassau County Medical Examiner's office would not say if Ahern's injuries were self-inflicted or due to a possible drug overdose, adding the investigation was ongoing.

Ahern suffered from a single gunshot wound to the head, police said.

Authorities reported they located a shotgun and a handgun at the scene. A spokesman for the New York City Fire Department said some of the injuries "appeared consistent with a shotgun blast."<|endoftext|>I have to admit that I had the same look of glee when looking over new iPhone 8 images today. Of course there are a few new things to look at, but the majority of the design is pretty much similar to its predecessors.

Here is what was already known before Apple began teasing the iPhone 8.

All new design

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were both released in September 2016. The iPhone 8 will only be available in white when it goes on sale on September 23. But it will be able to use all available colour variations of the iPhone 7, including iPhone 7 Plus, as well as iPad Pro.

S Pen stylus on the left, and Touch ID fingerprint scanner on the right

New 3D glass design

The iPhone 8's glass screen has a different design to that of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it will be a more "tapered" design compared to previous iPhone models.

This will also affect the Apple Pencil stylus and its placement relative to the speaker holes on the back of the iPhone 8, as well as other new features that the new iPhone 8 will have.

4K resolution

When Apple first announced the iPhone 8, it described it as the "world's first 4K phone" – but that still wasn't the only exciting feature. The iPhone 8 will also have 4K video recording capabilities, making it a true 4K phone.

It's a good thing for us all that Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus two days after they go on sale, as I am all excited for it, but I would have liked to see these two smartphones go head to head on the latest iPhone test.

Dual camera

While the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will have a dual-lens camera setup on the inside, they'll all be identical, featuring a 12 MP iSight camera on the back, and 12 MP camera in front. It was only revealed a few weeks back that the new models wouldn't support the Optical Image Stabilisation technology as is in the newer iPhones.

It's good to know that they won't be as quick and responsive as the cameras on the new iPhones are, but it's good to see them being included in devices I want to buy sooner than later.

The iPhone 8 will also include 5-megapixel front facing camera which could also be used as a SmartCam.

Other notable features to look out for

These are certainly a lot of other new features that will be available on the iPhone 8.

Apple Pay

Payments made using Apple Pay will be handled by the Touch ID sensor, which can be used when holding a credit or debit card.

The NFC chip on the iPhone 8 will also accept Apple Pay, making it more secure than past iPhones in which it could not be used for payment.

It will also be able to make Apple Pay payments to banks and restaurants, and use the mobile payments network Apple Pay.

The iPhone 8 will also support the Apple Watch Series 3, which will include the new Series 4 LTE and the new GPS chip on the Apple Watch Series 3 which will allow for a much better tracking feature.

Apple A10 Fusion processor

The iPhone 8 will have an updated processor with 4GB of RAM and a new custom A10 Fusion processor featuring a 256-core CPU, which will give it significantly better performance. The new chip will also come as a 64GB version.

We will probably see it being used in future phones if they continue to use it.

The iPhone 8 will also have support for the Bluetooth 4.1 specification, allowing it to stay up to date with new new wireless features like Quick Charge 2 and the Wireless Power Consortium.

The iOS 10 operating system

In addition to running the iPhone 8, Apple promises to update the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPad Pro running on the new system. iOS 10 is

The New York Times editorial board on Friday slammed President Trump's decision to rescind the Obama-era program to protect young immigrants, but they stopped well short of blaming the president.

The New York Times, which published several editorials on the issue this year, called the move "a big win for white nationalists and white supremacists."

On the day the program was set to roll, an editorial called it "a move that will certainly enrage parents from Central America."

The New York Times argued that Mr. Trump was right to take action.

"But it is important to note that his move was not about the immigrant children themselves," the article argued. "It was not an effort to address any particular problem, such as crime or health care. He was simply protecting vulnerable people he wanted to keep out. They are not the problem"

While the editorial board expressed caution for the time being, it acknowledged that the "Trump administration has so many unanswerable questions," and suggested that Mr. Trump's "actions have unsettled the hearts of many immigrants."

The editorial board also expressed optimism that the program will lead to broader reform in immigration policy.

"There is hope for the children of immigrants in this administration, or in future administrations," the editorial said. "President Obama, for example, had to deal with a Congress that is dominated by hard-liners and hostile to immigrants. Now is the time to bring the immigrant children into the conversation to reform immigration, and to improve their plight."<|endoftext|>About This Game

The proposal in its current form has the support of one of the state's two U.S. Senators, Maria Cantwell, but was opposed by the state's House lawmakers during a House Public Safety Committee meeting on Monday morning.

This marks the second time in a week that House members of the Joint Legislative Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security have been called to the state Capitol to consider expanding background checks to virtually every piece of gun-related purchasing — regardless of the sale. Last Thursday, they also considered a ban on semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines.

The House committee voted 31-5 in favor of the bill, which was co-sponsored by Sens. Andy Hill of Lake Stevens, Doug Ericksen of Anacortes and Don Benton of Ellensburg. The three lawmakers were the sole "no" votes during the committee's meeting last Thursday, which also featured testimony from families of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre, who were opposed to the bill.

House Republicans initially proposed the proposal as one of many amendments offered ahead of a potential vote on a bill that would require universal background checks for gun-related transactions — an effort that had stalled earlier this year because of Republican infighting

A company called Bitocean will help Chinese company, Alibaba to launch a mobile virtual currency (m-commerce) payment system. The move follows a partnership between the two companies earlier this year, in which Alibaba opened over 10,000 "AliBees" around the world, where customers could use m-money payment systems on their devices.

As the Chinese e-commerce market is forecast at over US$600bn by 2025, it will be crucial for Alibaba to enter into this market. Alibaba is hoping to use the m-money system for its own purposes, such as to facilitate payments to customers on other platforms such as Tencent's QQ.

Alibaba's CEO and founder, Jack Ma, is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin but has also expressed his concern for its lack of legitimacy in the market thus far. As such, he recently started a "Chinese Bitcoin" exchange Bitocean, which is aiming to "add legitimacy to Bitcoin", as well as offering a payment system which he says:

"will enhance the security of [Bitcoin] transactions, increase the speed of transaction settlement, and reduce the risk of fraud."

Bitocean has partnered with Alibaba, who will receive an undisclosed portion in exchange for integrating Bitocean m-commerce payment technology into its online retail payment platform. The startup is also aiming for a launch in Q4 of this year. This means that Alibaba will be able to implement services similar to those of Western e-retailers in China.

The move towards m-commerce is a positive one. Currently, e-commerce companies often offer payment methods such as credit cards through their online stores. M-commerce solutions, however, are a lot simpler than accepting credit cards. In the case of Alibaba, for example, all payment systems such as ACH, wires, wire transfers and so on will be supported.

According to The Nikkei Asian Review, Bitocean will provide a full-service m-commerce solution, including payment processing, e-wallet storage, e-commerce platform management, security analysis, data analysis and fraud risk management, along with transaction monitoring and support. The company also aims to reduce user-trust by providing transparency in m-commerce transactions to increase transparency of the users.

The move towards m-commerce is a positive one. Currently, e-commerce companies often offer payment methods such as credit cards through their online stores

The company says it will start with 3,000 merchant accounts, and will add more merchants as its business develops. In the first quarter of its operation, the platform will support Chinese merchants, although its full-service model, with merchant support, will be used internationally in future.

The company will also include the integration of blockchain technology, allowing the company to store e-tolls and make transactions more efficient and less costly

The move towards m-commerce is another positive one. Currently, e-commerce companies often offer payment methods such as credit cards through their online stores. They are, however, more complex systems than traditional payment gateways, such as Visa, and can be expensive. In addition, there is a major drawback for online shoppers, as online stores in China are notorious for poor customer service.

Blockchain technology can solve the problems of online shopping for both consumers and merchant. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger which allows for transactions to be recorded and shared without the need for a central authority to verify their authenticity.

According to The Nikkei Asian Review, the company says it will use a "multi-sig approach", where different groups of interested parties will be able to participate in creating the blockchain for various purposes.<|endoftext|>I've been watching a lot of video games recently.

The federal government may be pushing more gun purchases among American adults.

A new poll from Pew Research Center found that 40 percent of respondents said that they had purchased a firearm in the past six months — while 41 percent said they had not.

The results of the research, released Thursday, suggested that people who live in "gun-friendlier neighborhoods" are buying guns compared to the overall population. Respondents living in neighborhoods that Pew defined as "more gun-friendly" than their neighbors — which defined places with lower rates of household gun ownership, high levels of gun laws and higher rates of gun ownership in relation to the other households in the area — were more likely than those who lived in gun-friendly suburbs to say they were gun owners.

Meanwhile, gun ownership rates were lower in the suburbs than non- suburbs in all four of Pew's gun control indexes.

The Gallup-Healthways index found that the gun-owning rate was 11.6 percent in households where someone lives with someone who owns a gun, while it was 16.8 percent in households with no gun. The General Social Survey found the same results, as well.

The Pew research came the same week as a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics urged lawmakers in the U.S. to strengthen regulations on gun ownership.

"When adults are allowed to own firearms, parents can exercise more control and influence over the gun's use," the research released by the Academy, an organization of pediatricians, also noted. "Parents can also work together as a team to make gun safety the responsibility of the caregiver, not just the child."<|endoftext|>The first full volume of the legendary fantasy series, The Way of Kings , by Brandon Sanderson continues to captivate readers with its complex and mysterious world.

Almost half of adults in England and Northern Ireland suffered such a brain injury last year, which can cause severe headaches and insomnia.

A study of 6,000 people found many of them had trouble sleeping and suffered from depression at the time of injury or when they came to terms with their ordeal.

And the number of people living with a traumatic brain injury was on the rise, the report said.

In England and Wales, around 1,700 people suffering from a traumatic blow to the head are treated at hospitals each year, the report by the London Head Injury Institute said.

The researchers examined data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre and interviewed more than 6,000 people – 7,000 of them adults aged between 16 and 74 who had been involved in head injury-related incidents.

Dr Peter McShane, an institute adviser and neurologist at the University College London hospital, led the review.

He said: "Almost half of the people in this survey had experienced a traumatic brain injury – the injury that is usually classed in medical literature as major.

"This is an extremely traumatic event, and it has the potential to seriously affect both quality of life and overall happiness, and in some cases even result in death.

"The problem is that it takes some time to recover from, with feelings of depression and low motivation, and many people will not return to work, or continue with education, in the years after.

"There is a strong sense of stigma towards people with brain injury, which means that they feel like a second-class citizen in society. When they report their problems, they often feel they are being dismissed and judged in some ways, which doesn't allow them to be able to access psychological and psychiatric help.

"The majority of people had not been involved in any other traumatic incidents before being involved in a head injury – for many this is their first experience of this. They might come from a diverse background and with different mental and physiological profiles, but if this is the case, there is a need to consider whether a wider social network is lacking and to make

We'd all love to travel, but that's a lot different from actually doing it. And that's what makes the world's first ever flying taxi the perfect ticket for people who are too old, too poor, or simply afraid to take on the world's problems by themselves.

The Aeronautica Aerea Venezia (the AAV) — officially called the "Aerojet A-100" — is an Italian-made turboprop airplane launched last year to bring together five groups of people in the lowest socioeconomic bracket who want to fly.

The AAV's four crew members — all in their forties and fifties aged 70 and up — and a navigator sit in the cockpit of the airplane on a specially designed gondola that takes them out of the cockpit via a ramp at the back. The gondola makes the airplane much simpler to operate, eliminating the stress of carrying passengers and their luggage.

The AAV first took off in May for a 20-hour endurance flight from Pisa, northern Italy, over the Lake Garda — which also happened to be where the AAV was assembled — to Rome. The flight covered 8,000 kilometers with just 20 gallons of fuel per day.

After being fueled up, the gondola hovers for several minutes at high altitude on the same runway as the AAV. Once the airplane is in the air, a hydraulic system lifts the gondola to a higher altitude and drops it to the runway. It takes only two full rotations of the propeller — and a person — to drop the gondola.

The AAV is designed to be as simple and efficient to use as possible, with limited fuel consumption and a flight time of only three hours, according to Aeronautica Aerea. And because it has to be flown by hand, it can be used to teach new pilots the ropes.

The AAV is the brainchild of Italian entrepreneur Stefano Beniglia, who hopes that by funding a few thousand flights with the AAV, people of all ages around the world will feel compelled to venture off to the skies and see what's out there for them.

"All these people who have the capacity to make flight a reality are dying to make it a reality," Beniglia says in a video explaining the AAV by the website Flight International. "Today they don't go out and they never will … [so] the AAV is a solution to the social, psychological, and technological problem of flying."<|endoftext|>Michele Bachmann has made it clear she doesn't give a damn about her fellow citizens, whether they're gay, black or Muslim.

After the 9-11 attacks, Bachmann and other Republicans demanded the U.S. put an end to intelligence gathering on people, especially Muslim terrorists, and she's been a constant critic of our intelligence community's intelligence gathering on other countries.

So it seems a little rich that we even now find ourselves dealing with the threat of terrorism stemming not from people who want to murder us, but from people who simply are trying to overthrow the government of their home country.

When it comes to terrorism, Bachmann isn't concerned about the Constitution because the Constitution doesn't really apply to foreign nations, and she's willing to do what it takes to see us topple over — whether that means shutting down embassies or bombing our military bases, or threatening to invade us. She's also gone on record telling us we should put all our money into the military and take it from the poor. (Not to mention her support for sending troops back to Afghanistan.)


Her comments came to light when she appeared on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS. She told Zakaria, "We've got to know who's coming to America to do harm to this country and to attack us."

When she was questioned about what actions would be taken against people who wanted to harm us, Bachmann reiterated that the government should be able to spy on everyone. According to Mother Jones, she also told Zakaria that it's perfectly acceptable for the U.S. government to spy on people who they think may have ties to terrorism, "because you know what, as a government, you have the legal authority to look at anybody who looks like they might be a threat to this country. It just doesn't matter if they're American citizens, if they're from another country—we can spy on them."

While Bachmann has shown no remorse whatsoever for the deaths of American diplomats and soldiers in Benghazi or for the many Americans who have been dead in Afghanistan for years, it's clear she's willing to do anything she can to throw more and more bombs at innocent civilians. And that's not just on foreign policy.

When Zakaria asked if Americans should trust the president or "a bunch of political grandstanding politicians," Bachmann said, "You know, I just believe in what the president has done. This

This was my favorite day ever.

And he came to the kitchen for a few minutes to help me prepare French toast. I thought that after I served a plate of food, he would give me a kiss and then head upstairs and talk on the phone, but he stayed for a while and said he was having to go somewhere. Then he kissed me on the cheek and said he just wanted to make sure I was all right.

I was feeling quite romantic—or, rather, very much in love with him. He was very romantic and, although I was still quite shy, I was also feeling very attractive and I was very happy.

This was on a Sunday, so there were no distractions from Sunday School. It was so quiet at the house that we could not hear the dog at the neighbor's. This means that the dogs are never playing and there is not a lot of scratching from dogs that are not there.

As I was washing it, I accidentally dropped a rag out of my washing basket on my son-in-law's shoes. The dog jumped up and attacked him. That's one of the things I do not like about dogs. They are very aggressive, very territorial. Sometimes you don't know why.

When I came to, all my guests were sitting down to breakfast. He was standing by my side eating a piece of his breakfast. He had a look of confusion in his face; he had been acting pretty suspicious all morning.

"Don't worry," I told him as he picked up the rag. "He hasn't done anything to you. He has been behaving very well to everyone else but the dog, so he doesn't want his shoe on your foot."

I handed him his dish and he thanked me, then went into the kitchen.

He finished his toast and took some milk and began eating.

"I'm going to get my coat," I said, "and then you can all go and get yourself dressed."

"I'm fine," I said.

"You don't have to be. Just wait here."

I went back into the kitchen and washed my dishes. I picked up the rag and put it on the floor and went into the living room to talk to my son-in-law. I could hear the dog at the neighbor's, so I knew he was not going to come back.

"What was he talking about in the kitchen at breakfast?" said he.

"I told him that if he wanted to have the dog off his feet, he did not have to talk about it all day."

"What was that?"

"He was going to have to go away for several days. He was going to talk to all his friends, I thought, and tell them if they ever were at his house."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

This was the best day of my life. I had spent all morning with this man. He was a very good friend to me in my old age. I thought about how I would greet him on leaving for the day and how I would walk into his house. Now the house was empty. No one was there. I felt very sad for the poor dog, which I never would have expected to say anything. I could now go on spending my last week with this man. It made me so happy.

There was only one thing I didn't do for him. He didn't ask me to drive him to the city this summer.

***

Two weeks before he died, he gave me this card:

I had never read it before, but here was my son-in-law's message from another place.

The dog is going away for a couple of days. He won't be home much longer.

In the beginning of his message I just read:

An international effort has been underway for months, beginning with a group of scholars, and now it's a huge step closer: the United Nations' International Commission on Marijuana and the UN International Scientific Forum on Drug Policy, which includes more than 70 scientists. The commission is composed of 28 experts in 15 countries, including two UN-recognized special rapporteurs.

And the meeting of the panel at the UN's United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland, is scheduled for Wednesday.

It's a landmark project for the decriminalization of cannabis. It's the first time the body has looked at how criminalizing the drug harms not only individuals and communities but also the entire international system. And it's a first step in the long history of marijuana policy reform.

The commission will report back to the world's leaders in January, and a new UN secretary general is expected to release an official report. And all eyes are surely on the U.S., which will presumably be in the same political place that it was in 1995, when former President Bill Clinton announced the first federal policy shift in the legal status of marijuana.

The U.S. currently is leading the world in public and private policies. Last year, a Pew Survey found that a majority (54%) of Americans support legalizing marijuana, with 42% in favor of outright legalization.

Meanwhile, the drug war continues, costing trillions of dollars annually. There have, of course, been big changes over the past half century. First came the end of outright prohibition in the early-1960s, followed by state experiments with reform. But until recently, the U.S. has kept fighting the war on drugs, relying on a drug war that began in 1914 with marijuana prohibition and just concluded in 1965 with a half-century of mass incarceration for drug crimes.

It's hard to imagine how U.S. marijuana reformers can count on the U.N. to hold the line if a U.S. president takes an even more aggressive stance this November.

But that doesn't mean the next U.S. president won't make some significant shifts. In 2014, presidential candidate and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said he "does not believe that legalization of marijuana is the first step to legalization of a whole host of drugs." Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also indicated she's open to legalization.

And the U.N. is the world's largest single source of funding for global drug control. It's the world's largest single provider of aid for drug rehabilitation and prevention, supporting research in the field. And U.N. leaders have repeatedly said they support decriminalization in cases where the drug war is failing.

If there's any way to make progress on the issue of marijuana in the 21st century, then international cooperation is essential.

At the moment, the U.S. and other countries are largely fighting one another to enforce their own drug treaties. If those regimes fall apart, the U.S. and other countries may have to decide which one to sign with.

But the U.N. could take a lead role in a future international regime, if that happens. The panel report will have to include, in addition to marijuana, other drugs, which it should by now. The report also must set forth the best possible scientific methods for measuring the harms of use.

And it will have to include a fair definition of "drugs."

There's still plenty of time for the commission to come up with a definitive set of recommendations for marijuana policy reform, whether Obama takes office or not. But this new U.N. initiative provides the international community with a very strong voice.

We've made enough progress already. Now it's time to show it in the international arena.<|endoftext|>The following page is just a starting point for finding out all those things you are interested in

The Patriots released linebacker Nate Jones on Friday, but Jones returned home to Rhode Island for a reunion with his former New England teammates.

The New York Times reports Jones was spotted in Providence visiting his old Patriots teammates including Brandon Meriweather, James Develin, Deontae Skinner, Jerod Mayo, Jonathan Freeny in addition to former Boston-based QB Matt Cassel. It appears his reunion is a little different than just meeting some old friends and old teammates.

SACRAMENTO (CBS13) — A Sacramento judge has ruled that police officers don't have to release officers involved in shootings within 72 hours.

A man shot by a cop while driving away from an arrest in June 2011 has been fighting for years for the release of the information.

Jail records show Daniel Ramirez was arrested June 16, 2011. A Sacramento sheriff's deputy shot him as he fled from police in a stolen van.

Ramirez is appealing the shooting; his attorneys allege the deputy was driving recklessly and Ramirez was a flight risk. Ramirez' attorney wants officers involved in at least two other deadly shootings from 2011 turned over to Ramirez for review.

Sacramento County Sheriff Tom Allman called the release of documents to the media "an affront to public confidence."

The shooting is the highest-profile use of force by a Sacramento County deputy this year.

The decision on the shooting will now be transferred to the California attorney general because the case involves the Sacramento Sheriff Department and the FBI. Attorney General Kamala Harris' office will have to decide whether Ramirez' case warrants her office opening an investigation.

If an investigation is opened, Harris will decide whether to bring charges. If not, the decision will be made by Deputy Attorney General Matthew Hart on whether the shooting should be referred to state or federal court.

Sacramento County Sheriff's Office officials say they're disappointed with the decision.

"What's shocking to me about this decision, and what's going to further distress our office, is that we didn't hear about it for almost two years," Allman said. "For months and months this case was covered by the press. Our deputies got calls and letters from members of the community every day because we were involved in these types of cases and I still can't believe that it's been two years."

"In the course of the investigation you cannot take a case to another level," Sheriff Allman added. "Once you make that decision, or once any case, once you make a decision that says that information has to be made public, it's a big decision."<|endoftext|>This article explains how to modify the Android permissions used by the Play Store to better serve your personal privacy.

Google has a history of using permissions. In the past, Play Store users could only access some of these permissions, such as the read phone state permission that allowed them to access the storage on a device that isn't an unlocked phone. Now users can access full access to everything. Some people find this a dangerous shift for the Android ecosystem. Google is trying to protect users from third-party privacy intrusions. We're not interested in protecting you from Google's privacy intrusions, but we'd like to prevent others from abusing your personal data.

This is why, in order to make it harder to abuse personal data obtained using your data, the Play Store needs to give users more control over their apps.

As this article is already about privacy, I've also added this disclaimer: this post contains some technical details about Android permissions. Please understand those details, and if you're a new user, you probably shouldn't consider anything I'm about to say as good advice.

The main permissions to consider are read permissions. Google does not have a centralized list of permissions to grant to or deny to apps. In its permission requests, Google suggests that you grant or deny access to access specific features, such as the ability to access and/or download the full contents of a device's SD card. This is a very general idea that many Android users find intuitive and useful.

One problem that users have found is that when they attempt to grant those permissions, there is a significant delay before the requested permissions will be granted. The Google Play Store takes an extra moment to apply the permissions after the user allows the user account to have full write access to its storage. The longer this delay is present, the longer the user will be denied these permissions and, in the most extreme scenario, the user will be denied any permissions granted at all. The reason Google has made this delay possible, it explains in a Google Group email:

In order for users to be able to perform certain tasks, including to update an app, users must have full permission to access important system or account information (such as contacts, call logs, photos, texts, files, etc.) on the Android™ device where the app is installed. These permissions must appear when the user is making a purchase, or after they receive a new text message or phone call from a business or another user in good standing within their contacts on the device.

However, users find it difficult to understand why this delay will occur and, thus, even try to grant the permissions themselves. Google Play Store provides the following guidance to help users explain to Google and other apps why the delay in granting permissions actually hurts their own performance:

To simplify this discussion, understand that each "permission" is granted (or

[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit [official website] rejected [opinion, PDF] a request [opinion, PDF] by the Catholic Legal Immigration Network [advocacy website] on Wednesday to review an order [text, PDF] from [official website] the Ninth Circuit to block removal of two undocumented parents who lost custody after the birth of their son. The couple asked [Washington Post report] the Ninth Circuit to order the Obama Administration to release the mother without allowing her to deport the father and father without releasing their son. The Ninth Circuit [official website] said that the Obama Administration could not deny the parents due process because the Constitution did not provide them with due process under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), but the court disagreed with the argument. The case would be moot if the judge in the case agreed with the government position, but he did not and the case is now on appeal.

This case pits immigration status and child custody rights [JURIST backgrounder] on one side against the right for children to live with both parents in a stable family environment. The parents in the case, whose names were withheld, are originally from El Salvador. The mother has previously filed for an order of protection [JURIST reports] against her husband. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order [JURIST statement] preventing the deportation [JURIST report] of the husband until the courts evaluate [JURIST report] whether a hearing must occur before the child can have citizenship status, so it is possible the immigration status of the parents will be determined.

The actress, who has been dating and married to actor for seven years, thanked Cruise for his love and support for her. The two were spotted together at Disneyland in January.

"I thought you'd never leave," Holmes wrote in her post. "I didn't believe you for a second ... I'll miss you both so much ... I'm so thankful for the days you were here ... the days when we were just friends with a difference of opinion ... the days that became years, and then longer, and then more, and then ... I never understood why you left, and the more I tried to understand, the less I understood, and I couldn't. I am still trying to understand ... I have been so lost and lost in our relationship and your decision to leave ... but now I am so much happier knowing who I am, who we are, and who your love is. Thank you," she wrote.

HollywoodLife.com has reached out to reps for Cruise for more information. Holmes, 44, was seen with Cruise while in New York City on Feb. 25 and 27. Holmes thanked fans for their interest in their relationship in a post Wednesday. "I love you all," she wrote. "This is the most random, unplanned news I have ever made. I just wanted everyone to know how much I care. I hope this means you have loved me and always will loved me. I love you to the moon and back. Love," she wrote. Holmes also thanked her friends and family for their support. "My friends, family, and fans have been my rock and my strength and my belief in the strength that is you ... I love you all," she wrote.

Cleveland police are searching for six suspects in connection with the shooting death of a woman who police said was attempting to enter a home in the 6300 block of W. 127th Street. (Photo: Cleveland Police)

CLEVELAND — A 36-year-old woman is dead after she was shot multiple times while trying to enter a home in the city's north side.

Police are still searching for a gunman who shot her multiple times early Tuesday morning after he followed her to the front door of a home on the 6300 block of W. 127th Street, according to police.

Karma Lewis, 36, had previously lived at the home but was planning to move out of the area after being harassed by people in previous years, police said.

The woman was in the front yard of a home when two other suspects walked up to one of the home's back windows. The second suspect then opened fire.

Lewis was shot multiple times and died at the scene.

Cleveland police said officers found several people nearby and began a search for the shooter in an attempt to apprehend him. Police believe the shooter is a suspect in at least two prior shootings, according to police.

Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call 216-624-3031.

According to the Russian Investigative Committee, the case involved the hacking of the e-mail account of the director of the Investigative Committee in Donetsk Oblast, Yuri V. Lebedev.

The investigators suspected that he was targeted because of his involvement in the investigation into who was responsible for a series of bombings in Donetsk and Kharkiv regions in 2011 and 2012.

On Monday evening, the head of a federal security agency had a phone conversation with someone and sent the hacker a text message that contained an encoded password, suggesting the person was not a local, but rather a Russian hacker, the Investigative Committee said on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Lebedev met with a Russian officer and told him that someone was trying to hack his phone and computer, the Investigative Committee said. A Russian hacker contacted a journalist and confessed that he had broken into Lebedev's account and sent him a text message with an encoded password.

On Thursday, Lebedev contacted the agency's head, Vladimir Markin. When Markin called Lebedev on Friday, the hacker said that a computer had hacked into the e-mail account and said that someone had demanded $17,000 of Lebedev's money. According to Markin, the person had made the password hard to guess - but was not able to use his skills. The Russian asked Lebedev to make a call to the police.

"At this point, as the criminal investigation was not closed yet, Lebedev decided to make the call to the police," the Investigative Committee said in a statement.

After Lebedev asked a colleague to contact the Kiev City Security Service, investigators from the federal agency sent a team to the Kharkiv region to investigate. By Friday, they had determined that an organization called Cyber Alliance was responsible for hacking Lebedev's account, the report said.

The Cyber Alliance is made up of a group of volunteers "from all over Russia," Cyber Alliance said on its website. A group of Russian hackers and criminal groups created the organization to defend the users of the Darkode, a Web portal for downloading and sharing malware.

The hacking of Lebedev's phone and computer was not the only attempt to break into his e-mail account. As early as August, Lebedev had been targeted in another attempt via malicious e-mails disguised as emails from the Prosecutor General's Office in Luhansk Region.<|endoftext|>The first round of the NBA Draft has concluded with the New Orleans Pelicans selecting 6' 11" center Demetrius Jackson with the second overall pick. The former Florida Gators' big man fills a major need for the current Pelicans, as the team has only one real center on its roster right now in Alex Abrines. He has been able to contribute to the team in many ways, although his shot selection has been slightly off this past season in the Summer League, as well as the team's overall offensive production. With that in mind, it seems as though Jackson will get more out of himself on the court than most NBA centers. The Pelicans are hoping he can become the leader he was in high school when he was at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Pompano Beach, FL.

Demetrius Jackson is listed at 6' 11" and weighs 230 pounds. We know that he's got great strength, but he seems to struggle with his lower-body strength as he often seems to

We've seen what the new X1 Carbon and X1 Carbon SP can do in the last couple of years. This isn't likely to be any different.

Last year, Aston Martin unveiled the X1 Carbon. The car went on to win both DRIVE4COPD and Motor Trend's Car of the Year awards. The car was also one of the first to be given official track testing and a race car. Now, Aston Martin is giving both of those cars a refresh and releasing a new one this summer.

The new Aston Martin will have the same 4.3-liter twin-turbo V8 engine as its predecessors and will feature a few other upgrades. You get new brakes and a suspension with bigger anti-roll bars, and the interior gets upgraded with more quality materials.

While you don't get a carbon fibre roof or a racing stripe or anything, these updates should make the new Aston Martin at least as fast as the old one. That's a good thing, because you'd have to be pretty patient for two new versions to arrive at the same price within five years.

If you're an artist, or if you're interested in making your art more accessible to a broader audience, you should know more about the copyright laws and their implications, and the ways the Copyright Office is working on those problems.

If you're interested in sharing your ideas with as many people as possible, then copyright law is probably part of the story. But what if you think you have nothing to fear? Here's some background to help you decide.


What Are Copyright Terms in the U.S.?

The first step, before you can file a lawsuit to get a copyright, is to obtain a letter of authorization (also known as an authorization letter), which can be done by submitting your application through the internet.

(Note that you may want to start with the FAQ first.)

For this step, here's a simple overview. You'll need to first obtain a copyright, then submit an authorization letter by mail, then to file a lawsuit.

How Can I Protect My Copyright?

There are three different ways that copyright laws are designed to accomplish "copyright protection" in the US (in addition to copyright on works, the other two categories are patent protection and related trade secrets).

First, there are statutory copyright duration limitations on how long an author owns a work (the Copyright Office has the most detailed information about this). But there are also limits on the rights that a copyright holder has from the date of the work being originally created, and also for certain kinds of works under certain circumstances. In addition, there are additional protections that an author could have over information about the original work in ways not spelled out by law. These rules may apply to you or may not. If you think you were harmed by these laws or are the victim of copyright infringement, and you think that there's a possibility that you're the victim, you can start the process of filing a copyright infringement lawsuit. If you haven't filed a lawsuit yet, check out the next section.

(If you want the exact language of both of these limits, you can find it here.)

Second, the Copyright Act makes it possible to prevent others from reproducing your work, in certain circumstances. Some of these situations are not illegal. The DMCA is a law that criminalizes this type of copyright infringement. Here's more about that. And there are other ways to protect your work.

Third, if the Copyright Act doesn't apply to you, you have the right to "fair use" -- which means you can use something that belongs to someone else without permission, even if you've already received permission from that other person. Fair use is a big deal -- you could save a life by reading some news reports, or find out what a person has been doing over the last 20 years, without infringing the copyright on the reports or the person's life experiences. But fair use isn't for everyone -- some would consider this a violation of copyright, and you may be able to get in trouble. If you think you might be in trouble for fair use, you're best off with attorneys to help you, but check out the FAQ for more information on what you need to know.

Now that we've covered that, let's take a look at each one of our three categories of copyright protection.

First, you have statutory copyright and copyright duration limitations.

Then, you have the Copyright Act, which is the main legal framework for copyright and other laws within the United States.

And finally, you have fair use, which is a huge protection for your works.

How Long Can There Be Copyright Protection on a Work?

For "works" other than musical scores, music, and literary works, copyright lasts forever. A few situations might require renewal of copyright. For example, an author should be able to publish the work in her lifetime, so no copyright is extended after she's dead.

Copyright protection ends with the death of a copyright owner. In other words, if you publish a paper under your own name, and that paper becomes copyrighted after you pass away, you're not responsible for enforcing copyright after your death.

Some things may need copyright protection after you leave this earth, such as news reports, books, motion pictures, and paintings.

Will the Copyright Office Protect Your Copyright?

The Copyright Office will defend you against potential infringement, and it takes no action if a copyright is never renewed. If you are the subject of copyright infringement, you should contact your local government agency or copyright holder to get it taken care of.

In fact, the Copyright Office provides a "copyright troll" service by filing an enforcement proceeding, so you don't even have to handle an infringement yourself.

You should also remember that filing a lawsuit to enforce copyright is expensive, time-consuming process. It can be expensive to defend yourself in court.

What are Fair Use Protections?

Finally, if your copyright includes a work that is

Somerville High School's principal said she was sorry for having to shut down the school dance Wednesday because of the snowfall, but it turns out she was wrong.

The school's principal was sorry for telling students to stay off the sidewalks Wednesday night after a heavy snowfall, but now she thinks she was wrong.

"I apologize for having done this in the first place, and I'm sorry it happened," said Susan Gennaco, principal of Somerville's Woodlawn School.

She said the "very heavy" rain and wind knocked out power to the school, prompting her to have her staff and security force stay out in the school's parking lot all night.

"We had to cancel the dance due to the power blackout. We were afraid it would be so, so cold there."

In addition to the power outage and no school, the school also had its fire department on standby for students.

But Gennaco said those precautions were just not enough.

"We were really worried," she said. "We knew the wind would drive this snow, and we really did not feel our students would be able to handle it."

In a statement, Gennaco said, "We are currently looking at all options to keep students safe and warm during the long and windy nights ahead. While it may be tempting to keep everyone out of sight or hearing, that decision comes with the risk of creating a dangerous situation. As a result, we are re-evaluating our decision-making process.

"We are taking all of this very seriously but we want our students to have fun at this special event and know that we are ready to move forward to the dance."

When Gennaco was made aware of the snowstorm Wednesday, she ordered her staff to move the fire department out of the school's parking lot. At that point, she said, she felt safe having students stay on the sidewalks.

"There was no doubt about it," Gennaco said Sunday. "I really should have been thinking in two weeks time, but I was so concerned about the safety as far as the power was concerned that I wasn't."

The school's fire department said it was not the main reason the dance was canceled.

"I would have been really bummed if the fire department weren't there," said Lt. John McGlynn. McGlynn said Somerville firefighters were ready and ready to handle anyone who needed their help.

But Gennaco said the school's parking lot could have been a safer place for students to be.

"We could have been putting our own students in a very dangerous situation," she said.

Woodlawn and other neighboring schools did not close Wednesday, she said. Gennaco added that the school board and school administration are working together during this time to make sure the school system is preparing to keep Somerville kids warm and safe all winter.

The Woodlawn School is offering a snow day at all schools this Friday, and the Somervill School district offers a special lesson in snow safety on Wednesday, Gennaco said.

She said one of her priorities Thursday will be to have Somerville Fire Department stay on standby to respond to any emergencies or any other issues that may arise.

MARK STEYN-BROWN/FAIRFAX NZ Prime Minister John Key said "many of the same people" who were behind the Maori Party had been behind former National executive member James Shaw.

Prime Minister John Key says National has "a long history" of using the Maori Party as a way to win votes.

The Conservatives, Labour and the Greens are embroiled in controversy over whether to run candidates alongside the Māori Party in a new electorate set to be drawn up for the next general election.

Key confirmed the National Party had also used the Maori Party before.

"It's one of the oldest histories of political parties in New Zealand. I know them well personally and it's one of our oldest political parties as well.

JOHN HAWKINS/FAIRFAX NZ Former National executive member and Māori Party leader James Shaw has been investigated for alleged misconduct after allegations of sexual assault at his Palmerston North house.

"They've had various MPs come through their ranks and have won seats as Māori Party members, as MPs."

The prime minister would not say whether National had used the Māori Party against former National executive member James Shaw before his resignation.

But he did admit that National would often use a political partner to get into Parliament.

"I think we have a long history, and it certainly shows up in those lines of people we have been involved in politics with."

Shaw resigned from National on Thursday morning, amid a storm swirling around the party's response to allegations of sexual assault at his Palmerston North house.

It follows resignations of National Party MPs and Māori Party members, as well as the resignation of Key adviser Chris Finlayson.

The Māori Party is trying to gain a seat on the electorate commission, which is drawing up the boundary, and one of the other options being considered is that the party be included.

"I would see the inclusion of parties we are close to as an opportunity on the electorate commission," Key said.

"In New Zealand, I think we're all on the same team; I think the Labour Party in particular has embraced many of the same people and that's why we have a stable government in New Zealand now."<|endoftext|>The new season of "Game of Thrones" is about to start shooting in Spain. It's the kind of event that gives fans some sense of closure, in the form of an entire season with all of its major plot points established. But it was an early sign that the series itself had something in store for viewers that they have no control over.

The showrunners announced last weekend that a new "season" will premiere on Sunday, June 24, 2017. A few weeks ago they told reporters that this year they would not be adapting George R.R. Martin's books or creating any standalone films, but would instead continue their story with only an occasional scene set in George R.R. Martin's universe. As the story moves closer to its end, the actors have been given a big push to wrap up key parts of the story and get the next season started. Even though some of the season's events will be set in "A Storm of Swords," the fifth book in the saga, the producers are now going back and rewriting the show's finale, which takes place in the fifth book, A Dance with Dragons.

Now, on the podcast The Red Room with David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the show creators say the season will actually end on an exciting note, as we might have been expecting. In discussing the show's endgame, Benioff and Weiss are quick to note that they are already approaching a big moment where everything has come together and some sort of resolution can be found. They also say their plan for the finale actually involves "everything coming full circle," which is one of the phrases that we thought was a clever reference to the end of "Game of Thrones" before we realized it was actually referring to Jon Snow's resurrection. And it's not a completely surprising concept; when I interviewed David Benioff about the finale over two years ago, he told me that the story of the series might end up finishing on a cliffhanger or by having a big twist that you probably won't see coming. "Sometimes the end is not a resolution," Benioff told me.

In that same interview, Benioff said that the final season would, if possible, end after the Battle of the Blackwater: a battle in which the Star

It was a great success; people loved it, and a lot of people (including us) asked for the recipe. After some research, I discovered that a lot of those original recipes were still being sold by one of the big muffin manufacturers. And the main reason is, they weren't giving people the recipes. Their version was much more complicated, using many more ingredients and including things like buttermilk, yeast, and cornstarch.

Why would muffin companies keep people from the recipe? It's kind of sad to say, but I think they just don't want people to know how to make the Muffin recipe.

And because of the popularity of the recipe, I thought we should share it with your friends.

Unfortunately, many eating disorder professionals, and, some people and families, can contribute to the problem. The following list is offered as a resource.

Supporting People with Eating Disorders

When someone is struggling with an eating disorder, there may be many challenges within their daily life. This is especially so when there is a family history of an eating disorder. For example, a mother or a father may often have difficulties or difficulties with eating and emotional eating issues. This can make it difficult for them to fully participate in family life and relationships.

When a person with an eating disorder has difficulties in their relationships and family life, it may be one of the contributing factors to the eating disorder. The following are some ways that people and communities can support an eating disorder recovery process:

Provide information about eating disorders to people who need it.

Reassure parents, siblings, friends, coworkers, or others that they can find someone who is sensitive and supportive.

Establish a family and community support network.

Offer family or social programs to help people with eating disorders find employment and education.

Provide emotional support to people as needed.

Offer support for families, school, community, and health services.

Provide educational presentations that help people find healthy coping skills and coping strategies.

Develop supportive networks among professionals, schools, and other service providers.

Include people with eating disorders in community events (birthdays, barbecues) that are designed to encourage everyone, regardless of age, to enjoy life.

Provide a safe, supportive place to exercise at home or in a community.

If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder or if you have concerns about someone's ability to recover, please get in touch with us 24/7 by calling one of the following support lines:

BANGKOK — The government of Thailand hasLam Chit Pong, the head of the Buddhist Order, who was convicted of corruption and abuse of office, is set to serve the entirety of his seven-year sentence, a government official told BuzzFeed News. The sentence is to be announced today at 11 a.m. (2300 GMT), the official said. Pong is scheduled to officially be sentenced during a ceremony at the Rangoon Supreme Court in Rangoon and be removed from office the following day. The official said Pong was sentenced Monday. He was convicted along with three of his former aides for corruption and abuse of power, in connection with the procurement of a contract with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Authority (NBCA) for the national broadcasting service (Radio-TV). The NBCA contract cost $5.4 million from 2009 to 2013, and has been the subject of a government anticorruption investigation for two and a half years. The judge in the four-week trial handed down the final verdict in December . But it was delayed last month for an explanation from the court about whether it had enough information.

RANGON — The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) has denounced a decision today by the former head of the Buddhist Order to be sentenced to seven years in prison in a corruption case involving the national broadcasting business agency.

Pong is accused of accepting bribes totalling up to $22 million in exchange for granting contracts with the NBCA and a company owned by the UDD. His former chief of staff, Nong Poy Wongsom, and two of Pong's aides, Prachatai Natsakorn and Chatchai Sukdam, were convicted of corruption at the end of February 2015 and sentenced to life imprisonment. The government said Pong will be removed from his position, but the Supreme Court could also overturn the sentence, depending on how the UDD reacted.

The case has been described as the most serious since 2010, when former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a popular military coup and later jailed for corruption. Shinawatra also appealed against his sentence, but his sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court the year afterward. If the case proceeds, the case will be heard by an Appeals Court, with Pong's sentence being approved by a majority of court members.

Pong's sentence is likely to put him in an unenviable position. He won the presidency in 2014 with a large share of the vote, and his popularity has since been eroded by the corruption trials that have gripped the country. He said on his Facebook page on Friday that he did not accept his sentence, but refused to comment further as the Supreme Court began deliberating.<|endoftext|>A few minutes ago, I finished a set of the first three episodes of a new TV anime: Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale.

In this episode, we meet one of the main characters, Kirito, a normal boy with a normal life until he meets Kayaba Akihiko, a man known for murdering his students to build his online games empire. Kirito's goal is to find his real identity, so after seeing his real-world personality, he becomes convinced that Kayaba is the real deal and decides to help him find it.

The show is a sequel to the light novels written by Reki Kawahara, which were later adapted into anime and light novels (including a film) by A-1 Pictures. It's an enjoyable and emotional show, with its cast of eight young and diverse characters in every facet of the story.

This review, which is mostly a summary of this episode, will feature some spoiler-ish notes. However, if you'd like to know anything else about the show, I have a summary of the second episodes at the end of this text. You will need to read those first, and it will be up to you whether or not to proceed to the finale.

A Brief Look at the Characters

Kirito's Real Identity, or Real identity, as he's called by the game he controls, Asuna.

Kirito's parents, Suguha and Kibaicho, as the protagonist and antagonist in the anime.

Kirito's friend Asuna as the main character in the anime.

Kirito's brother Asuna as the supporting character.

Kogetsu Hana as a female character.

Kayaba Akihiko: The "Boss" of the game and the former leader of the Aincrad Army.

Akihiko: As Aincrad's greatest warlord, Kayaba is an iconic figure and one of the most complex and compelling figures to emerge from the setting. The way that Kayaba seems to use his reputation as an important political force for his own gain—as it is a way for him to manipulate others—is a fascinating element of the show.

When the first video began flooding the Internet, it did not take long to identify the culprit: an African-American woman.

The woman, Elizabeth "Lizzie" Johnson of Houston, Texas, was wearing her hair in braids and was holding a baby in her arms, wearing a beaded headband with a flower on it. Her face and body were covered in tattoos.

Johnson, a mother whose baby's head was covered in tattoos and whose face and body were covered in tattoos, may not have intended to look threatening, even if it was not the wisest thing to do. Still, her actions led to a fight that escalated into a fight that resulted in the death of her white, male attacker, 24-year-old Brian James Lucas. Johnson was charged with capital murder in his death.

The video clip has gone viral, appearing online more than 80,000 times as of this writing. Many viewers are appalled.

But other people have posted comments on social media saying that since Lucas's race was not known until about 20 minutes into the scuffle, the man is not responsible. Instead, they say that Lucas was simply responding to Johnson's aggressive behavior. The comments have been posted with the hashtag #KillAllWhiteMen.

In fact, Lucas was a white man. He was shot and killed by a black man, Donta Harris, in the bathroom of a church on the same night that another young black man, John Crawford III, was killed by police in Wisconsin when they confronted him for pointing a toy gun at children. A white sheriff's deputy was later charged with the murder in Crawford's death, and it was later determined that the officer was not racially motivated.

Regardless, white men have been the victims of racial-hate attacks.

According to an FBI report released in 2015, racial discrimination and hate crimes remain "persistent problems across the United States." The most frequent targets of this harassment were, unsurprisingly, people of color and their supporters, although "religious and others targeted" also made up the majority of victims (71 percent in 2012).

The numbers may have worsened in 2016, as two white men died after getting out of vehicles in which their passengers allegedly had their hands on guns, which was not the police calling the shots on them. The Washington Post reports that three police officers have been shot in the three months since the fatal shootings of Michael Brown and Freddie Gray in neighboring Baltimore.

The FBI report found that "disparities in a variety of areas such as housing, employment, education, health, and criminal justice are still present across all racial, ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups in the United States."

"The race of victims is frequently more important than the race of suspects in some violence related situations, particularly when the victim and suspect are both white or African-American," the report stated. "For example, people victimized by hate crimes targeting whites are more likely to be victims of hate crime and be victimized by a stranger, than are perpetrators of hate crimes targeting blacks or Hispanics."

The FBI also pointed to some of the motivations behind anti-black violence in its statistics. "Black victims and offenders face similar life threats: both African-American and white victims and offenders report victimization in the course of a violent crime and also in the context of physical injury; both African-American and white victims and offenders report an offender's use or threat of violence in the course of a violent crime," according to the report. "These findings suggest that the risk of African-American victims experiencing violence may be similar to the risk faced by their white victims in many instances."

In March, a white couple, Charles Thomas, 47, and Jessica Chambers, 45, were shot and killed in their home in suburban Cincinnati while it was occupied by a black family. Their murder was captured on videotape by the woman's husband, who was a relative of the couple, before he put his phone away. The same week, a local sheriff's deputy was shot and killed by a man who believed he was the shooter, a man claiming to be of black descent. He allegedly left the scene with the deputy's gun and a black bag with a gun inside. Authorities said the bag contained a note and a receipt with "KKK" written on it.

In October, two white women were attacked on a Southwest flight from Cincinnati to Kansas City, Missouri: One of them was assaulted and hospitalized for her injuries, while the other endured threats of violence. The attacker apparently made comments about the race of the woman who was assaulted.

And in October, a man walked into a church in South Carolina and shot and killed one clergyman, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was among nine shooting victims during a Bible study.

In October, a man was indicted and charged with killing an Indian man and wounding another man on a train in Arizona. The killer, 38-year-old Anthony Hernandez, apparently told the victim he

A group of volunteers has stepped up and begun replacing the sign on the gate of Nashville's most iconic rock club, The Ryman.

After two years of debate and political maneuvering, the Ryman Community Council approved a resolution Thursday allowing the city to purchase the sign, which marks a loss for one of the city's most legendary destinations.

"We're excited that it's going to go away," said Tim White, executive director of the National Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. "We want to maintain what's great here right now so that everyone can visit."

The decision comes nearly 18 months after Nashville Mayor Karl Dean announced his intention to sell City Hall and turn part of the historic building into the Ryman. Dean said he wanted the sign to "become a cultural icon in Nashville and the region," saying that a new building would give the landmark a boost of revenue and would draw more people to downtown.

But critics slammed Dean for pursuing the plan, arguing it wasn't needed to get the Ryman built. They cited the lack of any major construction along the corridor that intersects with the Ryman, the fact that neighboring clubs have managed to survive past two full years without any major renovations, and that it was cheaper to lease the building than it would've been to renovate it.

The building itself is considered so haunted that it's been the setting for a string of television shows, including 'Dexter,' 'Dexter,' 'Heroes,' 'The Walking Dead,' and 'The Walking Dead.' But no new construction has taken place in decades.

"I think it's a good decision," said Paul Davis, president of the Ryman. "If I was the owner of the Ryman, I'd be excited. It has a lot of potential to draw people. But it's hard to do. We need to upgrade the building to do that."

Davis said the sign, at 1003 Nashville Parkway, will go down when the current ownership sells. But while the current ownership group owns the Ryman, the city still needs to work out a new lease to take over the building.

"The city's ownership group is trying to do everything they possibly can to keep it in business," he said. "We don't have any financial interest in the Ryman. We want to see it succeed."

The issue comes about a year after the City Council announced a plan to use a new tax increment financing district around downtown to help fund major development projects. Dean and others wanted the Ryman sign to be included.

"It's part of what we have planned," said Councilwoman Megan Barry, who chairs the City Council's Public Works Committee. "But we need to look at it on a case-by-case basis."

"If we're buying a piece of property to do something, we want to make sure we have a plan," she said.

White said that the sign will definitely be removed, no matter what. He plans to meet with Dean as early as next week to share their plans.

"Hopefully we can be friends a little bit and work together," White said.

So, I don't think it is unreasonable for the white Americans, the Republicans and Republicans' supporters, to worry about what would happen to the entire system if their candidate loses. When people have a choice between two candidates who represent radically different political philosophies and philosophies that lead to very different policies, there is no reason for them to choose one of them.

Also, it's important to keep in mind that if we want people who look like me, who have black skin, are Christian, have American citizenship and are part of the American tradition and heritage, to have a voice in politics, we shouldn't be afraid to have a voice in politics. There is just as much reason to be concerned about white males not having a political voice as there is for people of color having a political voice and minorities not.

I'm not really concerned about losing the black vote. I'm concerned that our black youth are being encouraged to believe that black people are nothing more than stereotypes, nothing more than thugs.

As for the white vote, I have heard of a very strong push by Republican leaders to get white voters to stay home, which will only give a boost to the Democrats.

It is an effort that has thus far paid off, and in the last few months the administration has achieved considerable domestic and international accolades — including the UN Human Rights Council's highest honour.

"There is no country in the region or elsewhere in the world that is more open-minded, more enlightened, more tolerant than the Philippines," Duterte told the UN in 2015 — "and there is no country where human rights are respected as much as the Philippines."

But the reality for many Filipinos is quite the opposite. The National Capital Region (NCR) has been ranked among the most corrupt in the world by the Global Witness, with scores of reports exposing cases of extrajudicial killings, corruption and other abuses linked to "crime syndicates" or the state itself. Over the past year, the US State Department warned that the country could be on the verge of civil war.

ADVERTISEMENT

With that in mind, perhaps now is the right time to turn the spotlight back onto the Philippines' "crime" problem. This article seeks to explore the issues of crime, policing and violence in the Philippines and to assess the government's response.

The following is an outline of the main issues I will be looking at:

• Crime and the criminal justice system in the Philippines.

• Police forces, courts and prisons.

• The "war on drugs" and drug-related killings.

• Violence in the drug trade.

• Trafficking routes.

• Human rights abuses committed by law enforcement agencies and members of the military.

A discussion of crime problems in the country is complicated by a deep divide between the political Left and the Right, the two groups with the most experience in dealing with the country's internal security challenges. This divide has long been a source of domestic strife and is, in large part, an outcome of the Philippine political system itself.

For years, the Left's strong emphasis on social reform has largely meant their preference for government intervention in the economy and social issues, whereas for the Right, the focus has been mainly on military discipline and the rule of law. A country suffering from a population explosion driven by low life expectancy and an aging society, the Philippines has never experienced an insurgency. That is, until now.

Duterte is not only a populist president with a populist policy agenda; he is also a law-and-order candidate, and this has helped him win a remarkable 21,000 votes, or 40 percent, of the total nationwide vote, versus other candidates (more than the two top candidates in the national elections, Mar Roxas and Maria Leonor López de Cordova).

To an extent, this is just more evidence of a "carnage being fed with bullets" phenomenon in the country. In his inaugural speech, Duterte declared "in this country, every murder is a crime; every pusher is a pusher; every thief is a thief; every drug lord and criminal syndicate member is a drug lord or criminal syndicate member; and, I am, and always will be the president of all

A law enforcement source told DCist that a man had been shot in the head by a contractor working at McPherson Square early Friday morning.

The man was being treated at a hospital for critical injuries.

The Department of Defense (DOD) told DCist that it is "not aware of any injuries at McPherson Square."

A representative for the DoD told FOX 5 that it is not currently known when the contractor may be released. They did not elaborate.

The site of the shooting was closed off to traffic on Friday evening.

The incident has sent shockwaves through the DC community as the shooting occurred just down the street from the Justice Department.

"I was in a restaurant a few blocks away that I was told was closed," said witness, Brian Stalcup.

"The police did not know when it was going to happen so that was a bit of a concern as well, so it kind of left you wondering if something is going to happen in the area," Stalcup said.

Witnesses took to social media to express their shock and surprise at the violence.

In particular, we looked at the data Facebook was using for its ad targeting and, in an effort to help advertisers, here's a handy summary of a similar study done by another online advertising company (which is also owned by a very large online advertising company (who knows who else owns them as well))) called Google AdWords .

You'll notice a few things about Facebook's approach to this problem:

It's not limited to the United States. It's not trying to track US internet users. It's making use of many different databases. It uses statistical methods. Facebook doesn't care about privacy. Facebook doesn't track users who don't have a Facebook account.

So what gives? Do people really care that Facebook is tracking them in certain ways? And by tracking users, does Facebook mean to advertise to them based on their behavior within the Facebook social network itself, or does Facebook mean to serve them ads based on their activities on other websites, such as those using the Adsense network of tools? Or simply to track users who happen to be in the right physical part of the world, or one with a certain kind of computer?

In fact, one of the interesting things to me was that this is almost exactly the same approach that Facebook has been using since it started in 2008, when Facebook began to look at this problem more rigorously. Back then, I wrote about how Facebook was using the data from Google, and how the only reason Google's search engine wasn't the first to use the data was because Facebook used its own algorithm to do the tracking (a topic I'm actually pretty sure I'll be discussing a bunch, especially when Facebook's own data about activity on the network begins to surface).

So to summarize – Facebook was tracking people across the Web in 2008-09 for various reasons, including to see how active users were on the network, and how well it could 'match' advertisers with their target audience. In 2010, Facebook decided to abandon these efforts for a more limited (but still significant) purpose: to help advertisers 'reach' more people; Facebook only

Jefferson's own writing for the document — which was actually two separate drafts written on two different occasions — is now being released by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation for the protection of the author's reputation, and of course the public from misrepresentation and distortion.

The full text of Thomas Jefferson's draft is available at the site of the Jefferson Project, an online archive of over 100,000 pages of material, from the time of the Declaration of Independence, until today. It is a bit more than 6,000 pages. The draft which is posted here was in response to a query by Jefferson, in response to a query from James Madison, about the draft and the question of what the document would be and what it should say.

The questions Jefferson sent were quite detailed, including:

To whom the papers of the Declaration of Independence be addressed? The one or the other of the two? Do you intend to send each one separately, or together, as you please? You will find all the papers of the Declaration of Independence under one title. The titles I have attached will render easy your finding them individually. The first was originally addressed to "Her Majesty's Most Excellent Majesty Queen Charlotte," and was entitled "A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of Maryland from the Federal Union." In my answer to that letter the following questions were raised: "A declaration of immediate causes, on which the separation may be founded, is peculiarly required in the case of any new political unit. It must have the whole truth, both in facts and in law, and must explain the acts of that unit without imputing them to the whole. It must relate the reasons to which the unit owes its independence. Its purpose must be to secure its own rights, and not to destroy those of others, to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. All the provisions of the articles in question are embodied in this single proclamation in order to produce at once the sense and the effect of that which it proclaims; and to give to the principles which are contained therein a more ample and specific form." Having duly considered these circumstances, I have revised my original declaration, and have now made them the subject of several explanatory notes.

In the Jefferson drafts, on the first page, the letter, and the question of which one should be sent separately are addressed to "the one or the other"; on the second page, to "the one or the other"; on the third page, to both, and on the fourth page, to the one first and to the other. On page three, which is not included here because it is actually Jefferson's second draft, I did explain that "the first draft was originally addressed to 'Her Majesty's Most Excellent Majesty Queen Charlotte.'"

But on page four the questions are addressed solely to "her Majesty" and "her Majesty's Most Excellent Majesty." And on the fifth page, which, strangely enough, does not include the words "in reply to" even once, it is entirely "her Majesty's." Thus, the Jefferson draft begins on a different page from the one which has the question on the first page ("in reply to her Majesty's questions"), and the other answers to her questions have their answers left out and then reinserted as the draft proceeds.

As it has been with all of these drafts, the Jefferson drafts (1, 2, 3, etc.) can be purchased from the Thomas Jefferson Foundation website and through the Library of Congress.

A version of this post appeared on my personal blog, which can be found here. I have also published a book, Jefferson in Exile: America in the Reign of George III, which has been put on my website.<|endoftext|>The government of Alberta is not backing away from an effort to make the province's sex and relationship education more inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) teens in the workplace.

Education Minister Jeff Johnson says in an op-ed in the Calgary Herald the province isn't backing away from efforts to make Alberta a more welcoming society, despite its controversial laws legalizing same-sex marriage and civil unions.

Last week, Johnson signed a motion with the New Democratic Party calling on the government to create a public education campaign about safe workplace conditions for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered Albertans.

Alberta is one of the few Canadian provinces that doesn't have a law explicitly prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.

However, Johnson says in the op-ed the province is standing behind its policy of not imposing its views on other people.

Honda

Honda has been on the road to recovery recently, and the company says it's on track to return to profitability in 2020. The company's shares have had one of their best month-over-month moves in three years, with the stock soaring 17 percent in the six months since Nov. 1.

At its lowest point on June 24, the company's market value stood at $12.86 billion, compared to $18.5 billion as of Monday.

Honda's struggles have more to do with a falling value of the Japanese yen, which helps justify U.S. dollar-denominated Honda's profits and helps reduce its costs as it tries to expand its North American business to meet increasing global demand.

The company's outlook for the coming months is upbeat, says Honda Chief Financial Officer Satoshi Ogawa, and the firm doesn't plan to alter its planned 2016 capital expenditures.

When the yen's value is strong, such as it has been for the past year, Honda can charge higher dollars for dollars sold. "The U.S. dollar value of yen sales is one of the best parts of our business," Ogawa says. "With a weak yen, we think it's possible to maintain our current cash position."

Honda's biggest business, however, is North America, and it's struggling to sell bikes like the Civic in the United States where it hasn't been able to find an audience yet.

It's also struggling to win over a new segment of American consumers who have been largely uninterested in the sportier, more expensive bikes like the CR-V and the CR-Z.

Honda has tried to broaden its presence with new models like the Fit EV electric sports car as well as the i-MiEV, plug-in hybrids and high-tech concept cars, like the FCV concept, which Honda hopes to sell for a price of no more than $40,000.

Honda expects sales of these new models, along with its new commercial vehicle plans, and other brands such as Kia and Hyundai to help it return to profitability in at least half a decade and be profitable within the next five years. And these vehicles are more suited to a U.S. market in which the Honda Accord and its bigger siblings still dominate.

Although sales in North America are growing, there is still room for growth, Ogawa says, and the firm's business strategy is to expand through new vehicle markets, particularly China, where sales are projected to increase nearly 30 percent in 2014 and nearly half that in 2015.

The company believes that its growth in Asia will be more than its sales in the U.S. and Europe, and that the firm can capture a larger share of the large Chinese market. It's also developing an expansion strategy in Asia specifically in North America where it has been growing slower.

"We really have to do something in North America to bring more growth," Ogawa says in an interview. "I believe we're able to do something because of the [economic] downturn."<|endoftext|>In a new video from YouTube user The C-Files, a young woman named Kasey Cooper has a unique view into the world of adult entertainers. She discusses a typical day doing what she loves the most — dressing, performing and posing for fans. But, if anything else, this isn't exactly standard girl-on-girl work.

Cooper is the vice president of the adult entertainment company Vibrations. One of her big responsibilities is overseeing the production of videos for the company that are meant to be seen by the public, and the best part about this is that the work is incredibly sexualized and is almost always filmed by a male.

While she has been working in the adult industry for a little over a year, she didn't know this until she arrived at work on her first day.

It turns out that her fellow employees at her company also work in the adult industry too. This means that in addition to all of their work schedules being completely different, she also has to do her work behind-the-scenes behind closed doors in complete secrecy with a whole bunch of other guys who work there as well.

But this is just the beginning. Before you can be able to enjoy all of these different video sets (there are around 20 in all) you must first purchase the products from both the Vibrations shop and Vibrators Online.

As soon as you do this the other women from within the company begin talking trash about her and generally not being a fun group to be around. After making it clear that she doesn't want to "see her in any pictures" they start going over each other like a porno and talking about how they have "better cameras" than Cooper and other performers so she would be "perfect for it."

Cooper is never told about any of this, or made aware that she would be required to produce these videos or

Fully Loaded with a full spectrum of tools that are designed to work in harmony, these tools have been extensively tested and proven to work on iOS 9.3+ and OS X El Capitan. If you've previously created a build with an older version of Xcode before, see this tutorial: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT9116

These tools work as part of the Build Tools and Build Settings, as a sub-folder within the "Development" folder of Xcode. (You can also run these tools as a standalone executable if you so decide.)

The tools also have a new icon:

You can also install the tools using the terminal by running:

$ xcodebuild --help | grep appinfo

Note: On OS X El Capitan, the --help flag should not be used as it is now a required option to specify which tools are to be included in the package because of certain dependencies.


The current list of options for the build is:

-all (the default): run all tests

-quick (default): run a subset of the tests

-watch: watch the tests (default): run only the tests that fail

Usage

To build, run the following command:

$ xcodebuild [appinfo_folder]

To run the tools with specific options, you can use the following command:

$ xcodebuild [options]

You can also set options for multiple builds by passing the options to the same command:

$ xcodebuild build -options [appinfo_folder] [options]

Note that all options must be followed by the appropriate command.

Currently there is no support for running unit tests. If you need unit tests, you will probably want to use other third-party tools instead.

A handful of U.S. cities — including Austin, Denver, and San Diego — are planning to roll out their own Internet cafes to attract customers seeking a place to work or just relax over a coffee.

"If you are a digital nomad, you are on the move a lot. You might need to get Internet to research or do anything online. In these kinds of environments, this could be very useful," said Matt Martin, program director of the Council for Local Internet Access, which is pushing to bring high-speed Internet more widely across the country.

While other countries have similar plans, this doesn't mean U.S. consumers will be able to get a gig speed Internet anywhere in the near future, however. Right now, the companies building these businesses say that many customers aren't interested — unless they live in a city with plenty of competition.

"One of the challenges we are facing right now is how do we connect to the majority of households in the U.S.," said Marc Benioff, founder of Twitter. "We know there is a huge opportunity in connecting to underserved homes and businesses, but it is really hard to get there."

That's why startups such as Urban Airship and AirBnB have built their businesses on making it easier to set up Internet cafes.

Both companies allow independent operators to start in any neighborhood, whether that be a city with few options or a big city with dozens. The companies also work with cities on how to promote local businesses and give credit to places that offer it.

"If you had to ask which kind of city is a place where people are going to go to use the Internet … it's a tough road to navigate," said Benioff.

But these companies are also finding that more cities are interested in the idea — and are offering businesses a chance to test their new services.

Sierra Vista, Arizona and San Diego, California, have hosted initial tests of their Internet cafes, which are called "virtual cafes." The idea is to provide businesses with locations with Wi-Fi, but without the need to open up a restaurant storefront. Customers don't have to wait in long lines to get internet, and they get it faster.

"We really wanted to see if a non-traditional way would be really useful," said Sarah Davis, the city's chief of innovation. "We really wanted people to have Internet access without having to have a restaurant or bar in the front."

This is a big problem in many big cities. Some cities such as Washington DC, San Francisco, Austin and New York have all banned the use of public Wi-Fi in their establishments because it creates a "virtual monopoly," according to Benioff. By contrast, most cities don't have laws about a restaurant or bar's right to sell fast, free Internet access.

By now, most of you have seen the video of Alex Jones showing off all his "alternate facts" about the election, about Hillary Clinton, and about "the system" working against Bernie Sanders.

It was a brilliant moment to expose the way the right often uses facts that are just not true in order to manufacture the kind of emotion that is key in a right-wing election year. And, the Joneses are already working on turning this into a documentary.

Now, Alex Jones is doing what he can to spread those "facts" beyond his own circle.

At the suggestion of a concerned supporter, Jones is looking into getting an American flag made to sell for $100,000. He's got a bunch of people making plans for it, including a former Navy SEAL, a conservative Republican activist, and the producer of the "Reality Bites" cable show that was among the first to use fake "video" footage.

The first flag, called "The American Flag," will sell on his American Liberty Report website, where "Alex Jones" also sells other items.

Jones is raising nearly $75,000 toward The American Flag. That is a goal for the flag — and for an initial fund-raising round. Jones is considering a second round of fundraising, or raising more money after he gets the first round of orders.

Jones is "looking into making a flag to sell," according to the American Liberty Report website, where he's promoting a "patriotic book club" in his show.

The flag and book series are available to members of the American Liberty Report's "Patriot Book Club," said Kelly Gwyther, an editor for the American Liberty Report's parent company, American Free Press. She added that The American Flag flag, in its Kickstarter video, had raised about $70,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.

She said she does not know where Jones' money is coming from. "I'm not privy to that information," she said.

The Flag, which depicts a "Star Spangled Banner," was inspired by a "patriot" flag that Jones, a former Navy SEAL, made to put together with people he invited on his radio show, Gwyther said.

Gwyther said the "American Flag" could also sell for millions.

"We're trying to get it sold for as much as we can because it's not just our flag, but it's our patriotic book club," she said.

The flag and book series are not the first product that Jones has promoted online and through his media empire. When he launched his conspiracy website in 1999, he started selling T-shirts that said: "The World Is Flat." The shirts, which sell for $19.99, are available at Jones' website.

"We made that up," Jones said in a 2014 audio interview with WND.

The shirts have not been endorsed by Jones, Gwyther said.

The American Liberty Report website also promotes books that Jones claims "support" the conspiracy theory about the globalist goal with the United Nations to make "the United States irrelevant," and to "take away our Second Amendment."

Among the books that Jones' website features are a book titled, "The Plot to Seize the White House" by William Engdahl, a retired colonel and former senior Pentagon official who is a foreign affairs blogger.

Engdahl, also an ex-military man, is seen as something of an expert on the U.N. He is author of several books, "The World Order," "The Third World Invasion," and more.

Another book has been selling on "American Liberty Report" is a book by Robert Parry.

Parry has written extensively on government corruption and on what he calls "the coup d'etat," or the U.S. coup d'etat. He previously wrote a book about the Kennedy assassination and other subjects. He is a retired reporter who has covered the CIA and the United States national security establishment.

The American Liberty Report featured Parry's The Plot to Seize the White House in early 2016. It did not explain on its website why it included the book on its site or how it could be "fact checked."

A "American Liberty Report" reader named Joe, whose address was provided by Gwyther, posted his request for a flag on the American Liberty Report site, saying, "I have a few items that I would like to sell. One being the American Flag. Its an American flag but it's made to look like one of the countries they invaded in the last 80 years but its not an America flag. It is a flag the enemy uses. Do you think you can find out what country it's from? I can't get it into the hands of the flag maker but a quick Google search found out who it's made by."

Molly's Story of Birth

On September 21, 2007, my daughter Molly was born weighing 7lbs 6oz. She seemed to be doing better and better as we got older. As a toddler she would get upset because she couldn't get her hands on something. At age 3, my wife would say, "Just take a break," and Molly would get upset.

Molly was 4 1/2 years old when on April 26, 2008, we became pregnant again. I did a second full ultrasound of my 3rd pregnancy after the first missed on the second. This time the nurse, the midwife, and the doctor all thought they saw a clear spot on the ultrasound. (my husband and I were both surprised by that!) By April 29, 2008, it was apparent that we really were pregnant. I called my doctor and he sent me the information from the second ultrasound and said we should keep Molly and start trying to get pregnant again. I asked if we could wait until June or July and go to the fertility clinic in person for a second ultrasound. His response was, "Oh yes, it's possible. There are lots of times we could go in and do the physical exams over the phone. Most women only do that once or twice."

He recommended we go up and make a full physical a few weeks later and that way we could have a second one done while we were there. It was decided to travel to New York City to do our physical in person. We were booked to get a second ultrasound there by the midwife. I was to call her and let her know we were expecting. (my husband had a busy work schedule on his vacation and we took time when we could to plan the vacation!) We flew there March 12, 2009. I made a lot of phone calls to find out details. Most of the time the details were not the same. We made other arrangements and were told by the midwife that it was possible that the "preborn" parts of the fetus couldn't be seen on our second ultrasound, but she felt strongly that as long as she knew that it was a baby we should do it anyway. On March 31, we made an appointment for a 2nd full physical.

On May 15, 2009 I drove to mid-town Manhattan and took the subway to meet the midwife. In the lobby I had to show my insurance cards and sign an informational document so I could pay for the insurance with a credit card. My insurance had changed a few years earlier, allowing it to deny or add to my coverage things I do not need. My insurance didn't cover any of the things I normally have covered on my old plan. A couple weeks later this policy changed so we were offered a new plan, which was much more like the plan I was on when I had my first ultrasound.

I called midwife the day I was scheduled for my second full physical and asked about the possible cause of my miscarriage (this has happened to me before). She said she had discussed it with a family member who had had it, including me. She said the miscarriage was a side effect of the first pregnancy, and she had a similar "complication" that had gone away in the second pregnancy.

What had she been told about the second pregnancy? She said something about the fetal development of the first pregnancy and its effects on the fetus developing in the second pregnancy. I was surprised at the idea that there could be another possibility, it seemed almost to be begging to be looked into. We agreed to try to see our general practitioner next week and have his opinion.

On the day of the physical, the midwife said that we could have our blood drawn and have the ultrasound done that afternoon. I called to let him know we would be there and that he should be on it. It was then the doctor saw that the line on my finger was swollen. When he was looking at my finger he told me he had never seen a single cell in it that didn't turn a solid color. It looked like blackberries, all on one side. (he said I was showing red blood cells when there were not even any red cells in his line). The doctor also said that after I had gotten pregnant he had a few patients who got a little bump on their finger or their finger tips and asked if they could have it checked out. He said, "Just be sure to tell them in advance it's a pregnancy and not a broken bone."

My first question was why would a doctor tell patients to check for broken bones if I was not getting a break in my finger? He said the most common thing of concern is something like a carpal tunnel, which happens from excessive pressure of the hand from lifting something heavy. He said that if I didn't have anything of concern he would just want more blood drawn. He then said that there would be something done for me.

When I got there at 4 that afternoon the midwife did a full physical. She told

If you want your car to look as close in color to that of a real Ferrari, you might want to order a few thousand red Ferrari 599 models.

Ferrari has just released an amazing color scheme for some the company's iconic cars. The first of the five-colored Ferrari 599 models comes in metallic red. The Ferrari Enzo looks beautiful, too.

This new color scheme for the 599 is not Ferrari's first for the F1 car. In 2007, Ferrari unveiled a metallic red Red Bull that was intended to help give the car an "unrivalled power" and "extreme performance."

Read our review of the 599.

The color scheme for the Enzo is a bit more subtle, but still looks awesome, too — especially compared to earlier examples of the same color.

We've been waiting for the green-red 599 to finally grace the showroom floor. Will it look that good?

"The new Ferrari 599 is the first 599 ever to include real leather" for the first time ever, the company says in the press release.

Also, the car has an incredible interior compared to anything seen on the road.

The 599 will come in two models: 4,700 pounds ($117,900) that's powered by a 500 horsepower V-8 engine and 4,900 pounds ($126,850) that has a 599 engine.

The 599 will reach 60 miles per hour from rest in as little as 3.1 seconds, according to Ferrari. That's 10 percent faster than an F1 car, and also 30 percent faster than its closest competitor, the Ferrari 458 Italia.

If you're interested in ordering a red 599 Ferrari, you can call Ferrari Car Studio at 888-567-1212 or click here for their dealer locator.

The top Hamas leader Khaled Meshal is expected to go out of office Monday after a year of a power struggle with political rivals.

In a press release Sunday, Haniyeh announced on Monday that Meshal will be appointed deputy prime minister - a cabinet position.

The former militant who led Hamas during the 2014 military takeover in Gaza is to be replaced by Ahmad al-Madhoun, a top cleric and a senior member of the Supreme Shari'ah Court.

Meshal is expected to travel to Tehran to accept his new ministry position.

Hamas' refusal to accept the unity government, which agreed to hold elections before a new government is formed, has led the group to boycott the process.

The new unity government announced last week includes Hamas' political rivals Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and the faction of Islamic Jihad, which has a moderate Islamist ideology.

Both groups have been in the running for government positions since Israel and Egyptian intelligence raided Gaza's al-Mekhtar al-Thaniya building Friday on suspicion that Hamas officers were planning to attack Israel, a charge the group denies.<|endoftext|>Cisco

SAN FRANCISCO — Network-connected "smart" home devices could soon be out of reach of law enforcement.

Two recent court cases have signaled a move away from the traditional "policing the perimeter" approach to technology and toward a more "data-centric approach" that will be harder to penetrate, even for law enforcement, according to two industry executives familiar with the developments.

And a third executive, noting that both Cisco and Microsoft Corporation are working together to develop a "data-driven approach" to policing, said his companies are collaborating to determine what information from the internet traffic of homes, offices and even streetscapes could be useful for law enforcement.

Law enforcement officials believe that the information gathered from monitoring smart device activity, such as when a connected device is used in a crime, could lead to a better understanding of an area's crime activity and the location of suspects.

In the first case Monday, the U.S. District Court in San Jose granted a preliminary injunction that would give courts across the nation authority to require Apple Inc. to help police install software on an iPhone that allows them to break into its secure enclave.

The injunction could allow police to access a locked phone without a warrant, and it could allow them to conduct a forensic analysis of the device, including the ability to extract and decrypt data, according to a statement from the district court in San Jose, which is part of California.

Apple did not comment on Monday's developments.

The court cases hinge on the fact that the

On Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau published the 2012 American Community Survey estimates for cities, counties, and places in Texas — the newest data in a long history of county-level data. Many of these metro areas, especially those outside Houston and Austin, have reported population declines for years. And the census results suggest that the situation isn't changing any time soon.

Texas counties with populations over 250,000:

Population: 7,856,913

Number of cities: 703

Number of counties: 10

Number of places: 1,106

Population changes : 1,060

Total population change: -3.3%

Population growth : 7.7%

Unsurprisingly, Dallas County continues to lead the way. This includes not just the five cities and four counties in which it borders, but also its six surrounding counties.

The other Texas counties with significant population losses were in Harris, Fort Bend, and Harris.

The population is in decline in Harris County due to what can best be described as a death spiral:

Population: 48,732,967

Number of cities: 2,054

Number of counties: 6,749

Number of places: 3,073

Population changes : -2,632

Total population change: -31.0%

Population growth : 16.2%

Population decreases : 3.9%

Total number of residents leaving Harris County (since 1997): 1,981,200

Total residents leaving Harris County since 1997: 2,919,500

We can see a similar pattern with Fort Bend and Montgomery Counties. Both saw a decline from 2007 to the 2010 census, with Fort Bend experiencing the largest loss in percent change between the 2007 and 2010 count. Montgomery experienced the largest percentage loss in percent change between the 2006 and 2010 count — over 30 percent.

Finally, we have Travis County, which is in the Houston metro area. Its population increased slightly from 2007 to 2010 as people flowed into the area, but since then it has shrunk again, and is still shedding residents. The number in Travis is down by more than 4 percent for the last decade, and is the only Texas-based county that lost population between 2009 and 2010.

Texas cities with populations over 250,000:

Population: 7,746,543

Number of cities: 1,061

Number of counties: 10,948

Number of places: 966

Population changes : 1,073

Total population change: -2.7%

Population growth : 8.5%

Unsurprisingly, Austin is still the most populous Texas city, with more than 4 million residents. Houston, with almost 3 million residents, and Dallas, with over 2.2 million, each have at least a million fewer residents than in 2000.


The rest of the cities of note are still in Texas, but they're increasingly losing ground. San Antonio's population is down over 5 percent over the last decade, and its city center is on the rise. Austin's population is down over 10 percent, as the city has lost more than 1 million residents since the 2001 census. The number of Austin residents living in poverty has risen to nearly 12 percent in 2010 (the latest year of available data), which isn't entirely unexpected.

But the largest cities are seeing much larger drops — both from the population and from percentage changes.

Total population changes :

Population growth :

Unsurprisingly, Houston lost nearly 100,000 residents between 2000 and 2010, and the number of Austinites living in poverty has risen to nearly 12 percent. The Census reported that almost 80,000 people left Houston between 2000 and 2010.

Cities are only part of an urban region, a fact highlighted by the fact that most of the Texas cities on this list are rural. And a significant number of those in the rural counties are also in decline.

Texas cities with populations over 250,000:

Population: 3,958,038

Number of cities: 657

Number of counties: 30,908

Number of places: 864

Population changes : 742

Total population change: 22.2%

Population growth : 9.3%

Unsurprisingly, Lubbock went through the worst decline, with the population falling by more than 20,000 from 2000 to 2010. Waco, which experienced the third-largest population loss, had a second consecutive drop.

Population trends :

Unsurprisingly, the largest population declines are in counties that lie largely outside the largest cities in Texas — in fact, the only other two counties with populations between 500,000 and 1 million are in Waco.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads needs to increase the number of inspectors in NSW and increase the size of the workforce to deal with the problem, says Labor.

NSW is one of just two states where the government has no capacity to meet the growing level of demand, including for the most serious types of traffic incidents, according to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency.

Leeson Barracks, located at Bannockburn in western Sydney.

On Tuesday, NSW Fair Trading, the Department of Transport and Main Roads, and the police were locked in an attempt to make up for lost time in an annual report on the state government's performance.

As well as warning of a possible collapse in the economy and a significant deficit, the report said the state government needed to increase its capacity for detecting and dealing with motor vehicle and other crashes.

''I know some people are saying it's not a big deal. It's what we've got and we should just hang on until we find a way of getting more,'' NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe told Fairfax Media.

In December this year the Fair Trading Commission found the government could not meet its demand for inspections and enforcement of laws regulating the speed, weight, licensing, safety and air quality on roads.<|endoftext|>In the past few months, I have been writing a variety of articles here on the site about the issue of how to improve the speed of your web site, which has led to a good amount of debate and discussion in the comments sections. (Click here to read articles on building faster sites and here to read articles about improving response speeds for site visitors.)

It is my contention that we have no choice but to go to the extreme level of optimizing our site for speed. There are many reasons that you need this. Perhaps the main one is the amount and complexity of the data you are passing around, with the addition of data, information, and features you are providing to your visitors. These are the most critical reasons for the need to build a fast web site.

But, more and more often, other sites are making the choice to improve their performance by decreasing costs. They are getting together with their own resources and hiring an engine that handles all their content and the way the information is accessed. This is not only a good decision, but an entirely reasonable one. For the sake of saving costs, we should be willing to go to those extremes with our clients, since we ourselves need to save money for many of our clients. But, as always, there is a difference between the two approaches that often leads to a situation that we, a client, don't like. And this is a good conversation to have when you do hire one of these engines.

So, the first step is to talk to the client and see what they are looking for. How many pages are you trying to get per visit? How quickly can you get pages off the page? What type of data does your site process? These are important questions to ask, but the answer to them does not have to lead to this extreme level of optimization.

There are two approaches to making your web site faster that we will talk about. One is to create a new design for your entire site, and the other is to add an engine that handles the navigation for you. We will not talk about an engine here that handles only the HTML and HTML5. We will also not talk about the difference between adding an engine, or doing more of the design work yourself through different methods.

The design approach is one of the more common ones. Designers try to increase page load speed by thinking about how the page works, not how it looks. A good example of this is the new Google logo. A designer might think about how the new logo works for the web.

The same might be true of how the page loads on your web site if you use a caching system built for the web. This is the approach that I would suggest using if you have a large site. (This assumes that you have no performance problem in your server, so this will need to be a new system if you are a new client doing a redesign.)

A great benefit to this type of design approach is that it is a lot easier to implement. It might seem like there are more technical problems in creating a new design in terms of getting design elements like fonts and color for example, but there might be less trouble figuring out how to add a new engine.

A downside is that it comes at the cost of a decrease in the amount of content you are passing around. This is especially true for larger and complicated sites that contain information and content that you can't afford to lose. For example, one way that I do a redesign is to change all the images to different color schemes. Another design approach I have adopted is using a design method called content-driven design, which is a method that I have used a lot since I have started redesigning websites. My

Pineapple Upside Down Cake Ingredients

1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature

1/2 cup granulated sugar

1 cup sour cream

1 egg, at room temperature

2 large eggs and 1 large egg white, at room temperature

2 large egg whites, at room temperature

3 large egg yolks

3/4 cup freshly squeezed pineapple juice (about 1/2 gallon)

1 tablespoon orange juice (about 1 1/2 gallons)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.

Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and set aside.

In a food processor, combine the sour cream, sugar, butter and eggs. Process until incorporated but with little lumps, about 1 minute, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as necessary. Add the vanilla extract and process until blended completely. Add the eggs one at a time, processing in batches.

Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture and beat just until blended, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as necessary.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 4 equal pieces by a 2 1/4-inch edge. Use a 5-inch round pizza pan as a guide and turn the pieces of dough that are 2 1/2 to 3 inches longer than the pan. Place 2 pieces on top of each other, pressing down to form the puffy top. Gently press down with your hand to flatten top. If desired, press a piece of parchment paper on bottom of pan (or use whatever thickness of paper you want). Sprinkle with more pineapple juice and orange juice, if necessary, and bake for 30 minutes.

While the cake is baking, in a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and egg whites until they are lightly pale, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the juice mixture until combined. Pour over top of the pineapple cake and spread evenly. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.

Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. Once cool, slice into bars, using a sharp knife to remove a portion of the cake if necessary. Chill and enjoy!<|endoftext|>By the time it came to this year's "A Song of Ice and Fire" ( Game of Thrones ) book tour in Belfast , I had already been out of Belfast for eight days. The first day of the tour was an epic, raucous adventure in which my son, two friends and one of my daughters spent a day and night on the river. I was thrilled when I was called in to the hotel that night with the "Belfast Times" to help out with the book tour in Northern Ireland, which is why I never imagined that the next day would be like this.

For this year alone, there were over 50 bands playing with over 50,000 fans attending. In between these performances, the biggest stars and headliners shared the main stage with an assortment of other acts, from new talent to more established acts. It was hard to keep my head above water.

One of the headliners that really stood out is a band called Kaskade. Kaskade is a producer that is known for bringing in new sounds to the EDM crowd. When I looked their Facebook page I couldn't believe what I saw; a very chill guy doing his thing.

He played an incredible set, and it showed no signs of stopping throughout the entire weekend. A couple of big names joined him on stage, but one was a very special guest.

DJ Snake played his set, and it was an absolutely amazing one. I would strongly suggest checking out his set at Kaskade's official website if you have the chance.

I couldn't believe that someone such as DJ Snake and someone like Kaskade could connect so well. This festival truly shows what the power of unity can achieve.<|endoftext|>TRAINING AND TRAINING STAY is the ultimate online resource for learning martial arts.

"What's this Einstein?" Lindgren asked them, and they replied that it was a new and profound work in physics, on which Lindgren was to be the first author. Lindgren began to read it, and was so impressed that she agreed to write the introduction.

The new book was The New Science of Life. Lindgren was the first author of an American science book to be published in its original form in Germany before it came to America—one that would soon spawn a generation of writers who would come to form today's popular science magazines, for their writing about science and literature.

In the decades before Lindgren's entry into the limelight, science writers had been writing about ideas and concepts for a few years, especially for those writers living in the U.S. and British colonies. But Lindgren's work was not immediately translated for English-speaking readers because of its revolutionary subject matter—the notion that every living thing is made up of molecules. Scientists often talked about this "macro" theory of biology. Lindgren's book challenged it. The book's initial German title, The New Chemical Theory of Biology, suggested that every living thing had to fit into a system. When The New Chemical Theory of Life was finally published in England in 1894, the title was changed to The Life of Molecules:

Every living thing must live in a molecule, or be nothing, because every living thing is the actual expression of chemical action.

And so the title stuck.

For those of us living in more recent decades, the title of Lindgren's book has stuck with us, too (see: the cover of the September 1999 issue of New Scientist). It's hard to imagine today what the editors of New Scientist of the time thought it meant, but back then, there was no such thing as a scientific journal publishing such a radical concept. "I thought it was great," said John Maddox, who was an editor on the project in 1898. "The book was a masterpiece. It's a book the editors didn't even dare to imagine doing."

Lindgren, a scientist and mathematician at the university of Uppsala, was known for presenting ideas with wit and a flair for the dramatic. She was also known for her sharp criticism of her contemporaries, whom she referred to as "neoliberals," or the "neo-mercantilists," for their support of protectionism and for their opposition to protectionism.

One of the major themes in Lindgren's book is that the idea of "life" is not a fixed entity, but rather a product of a dynamic field known as "molecular interaction." When a molecule like DNA "binds" with a protein, a chemical reaction takes place, generating a living cell of some kind. These processes happen at the very microscopic level, and they take place over and over again.

In an 1885 debate, physicist Charles James Keir made a point about "molecular interaction" by comparing the chemical bond to a rope and a tree. When the tree grows, the rope must be maintained, and so it does. In this example, Keir implied that the bond is a physical substance with "bound" qualities, not some kind of mental thing. In Lindgren's case:

If a human being is to live, he must take a part of himself and make of him what he will, and must be in effect a chemical agent. Whence comes that mysterious attraction which compels his blood to circulate and makes his nerves to react, and causes his liver to produce gastric juices and his kidneys to produce urine; and all these things without which life is impossible. The great principle which binds them all together is the constant operation of chemistry.

This is a big concept, and one that Lindgren didn't quite get right at the time she wrote The New Science of Life. Her words, according to the book's own account, were: "The life process involves the creation from water of the vital principles of life itself from one

The United Nations, on the other hand, is on the frontlines of the most pressing battle raging across the planet. It's a battle that needs to be fought in a spirit of humility. And it's a battle that is about to be fought on a world stage with one of its most powerful institutions.

The U.N. has a role to play in a new effort to end mass atrocity crimes against humanity, and it has the unique opportunity to demonstrate leadership on this crucial issue. The U.N. should seize the opportunity to take a leadership role on this important issue.

At the forefront of this initiative is United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein (Arabic: رضي الله عند رحمه الله) who leads the U.N.'s Commission on International Justice and Peace. Mr. Hussein is a courageous, committed and tireless activist committed to protecting the most vulnerable and vulnerable among us. With this leadership role comes enormous responsibility, which includes taking a leadership role on this issue.

The atrocities continue in Syria (which the U.N. has designated a "country of concern"). More than 350,000 people have been killed in three and a half years of conflict, including more than 40,000 civilians. The war has led to the displacement of three million Syrians to neighboring countries.

As Zeid writes in this month's report, "In almost four years of bloody conflict there has been no ceasefire, no political process and no agreement on fundamental rights. In the last few days, the Syrian government has made a tragic decision to make its people pay the ultimate price in a battle for their very lives. It is time for the world to stand with the Syrian people."

The Assad regime's brutal actions – and the brutality of the opposition it supports – are the two obvious causes of the crisis. As the U.N.'s Special Representative of the Secretary-General stated in a statement yesterday following a meeting with Assad and his military, the Syrian government is using chemical weapons "against its own people with impunity because of continued and systematic international silence."

There is also the question of regional support for the Assad regime, including the continued arming, financial and military support by Gulf countries.

The United States and other countries are also complicit in Syria's atrocities. The U.S. is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which bans the use of chemical weapons. The Trump administration has shown little regard for international norms by not enforcing the CWC to the letter after the regime used chemical weapons in an attack in Idlib earlier this month. The U.S. also provided Assad's regime with non-lethal assistance, including anti-tank weapons, targeting assistance and intelligence assistance – all in violation of the CWC.

And the regime has not been abandoned even after the chemical weapons attack on April 4, 2017. The regime continues to bomb civilians and rebel held neighborhoods in Aleppo, killing and injuring thousands of civilians, in violation of international law.

The U.S. should be leading the U.N. to address these realities. In particular, the U.S. should be using its leverage to end arms sales to Syrian President Bashar al Assad (though Congress can still hold the Obama administration responsible). The U.S. should also be working to ensure that arms do not get to jihadists, al Qaeda and Daesh.

There is also the question of the regime's use of chemical weapons against its own people. Assad's government has a long history of attacking, gassing, and killing its own citizens, including children. According to the UN, between April 2011 and January 2014, the Syrian government launched between 8,000 and 18,000 attacks using chlorine gas on residential, governmental and military targets. The Syrian government used poisonous gas against its own civilians even after the agreement in 2013 under which it agreed to destroy Syria's chemical weapons. The U.N. investigated that attack on the Khan Sheikhoun town and found multiple locations of toxic attacks.

The U.S. must not be silent in the face of this heinous war crime, or it will ensure that the Assad regime is able to continue its brutality against its own people. In this context, the Trump administration's decision to strike Shayrat airbase in northern Syria by cruise missiles after the regime fired more than 75 rockets into a residential area makes no sense. The U.S. is only able to take action against military targets because it has made it clear that it would only take action if it believed the Assad regime was using chemical weapons to commit these crimes.

The Trump administration's actions have made it clear that the Assad regime must be held accountable for the chemical attacks on its own people. The actions were also in line with international law and international norms. Moreover, U.S. actions to degrade the war-making capabilities of the Assad regime would not change much if the U.S.

This video is really, really funny. What's funny is how hilarious it is that this cat is so upset he's throwing up his own poop, but I guess when he sees poop in his own cat's mouth, he gets a bit overzealous. The video is a bit longer and contains a few different cat videos because this cat is being funny and funny can be offensive. But that makes sense, in-fact, I did think the cat was a bomb when I first saw it, but then I thought about it for a moment and realized that this cat has a lot more to worry about than a poop bomb, and so he really was not.

Anyway, this cat is probably a very sensitive one. He probably thinks people take good care of him because he looks like he does, when in fact they don't. You'd be amazed how many people look good and seem to love dogs but are very stingy when it comes to their own pets. Or when animals in general don't seem to get taken care of, since they often don't seem to worry about the poor things too much. This video shows how sensitive this cat is. As the cat gets more and more frustrated, he begins throwing up.

I don't think this cat wants his poop to be in peoples mouths. Maybe the whole fighting thing might have started to make him anxious? I just think that this cat has just been through too much. It's amazing how much stress can kill a person mentally, or it can even kill a person physically, especially if someone is overly stressed and anxious.

That's all I've got for now. You can watch the video here. It's called:

Cat Pooping In His Own Cat's Mouth<|endoftext|>SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- Four hours into Notre Dame's first practice of fall camp last Friday, head coach Brian Kelly was in what might have been an ideal place to go over what had passed through his head as he entered the locker room with the team.

Notre Dame's first season without coach Brian Kelly went off without a hitch. The Irish, who were 2-10 all-time against Michigan State in 2012, beat the Spartans 45-28. AP Photo/John Raoux

A reporter and camera man were already standing next to the door and a reporter, after the story had been done.

Kelly had already made one or two comments. On defense. On offense. On the offense. Then, he walked into the room. But as he walked in, he had no idea that, at 8:20 a.m., there would be one thing more he said than he would have done otherwise: "Thank you for coming in."

After Kelly's speech, the media had already begun filing inside, and it was obvious that the news of Notre Dame's first 10-win season in 35 years was still with them. But there were also cameras and reporters milling around outside practice -- including the cameraman who was right behind Kelly in the locker room -- and no one had any idea what they would actually say.

It's a lesson the Irish coach will have to learn again in 2013. On that warm September morning last year, Kelly had been fired, on the same day that Michigan State lost a 28-21 game to Ohio State.

On Saturday, the next day, with Notre Dame's first-year coach, Brian Kelly, now in charge of his own program, it was clear from the get-go that those five hours, which included practice, lunch that included a full-plate buffet (chicken salad with tomato, provolone, broccoli and feta), and then more lunch, would make for the best 10 hours he had enjoyed in a while. There were some early nerves from the media, in addition to the usual issues of time and space. There were also a great deal of reporters sitting around waiting for one single question to be answered and

University of Maryland administrators announced this week that they will no longer use gender-neutral pronouns including ze, zir, hir, and xe.

According to the university's webpage, the new policy, which will be announced at 5 p.m. Tuesday, is intended to provide a "safe space" for students.

The current policy was established more than a decade ago but was recently "found constitutional by the Washington state Supreme Court."

University spokesman Anthony DeGiulio says the change will result in the "end to the use of gender-neutral pronouns." He also told The Daily Targum that the change is in line with the university's commitment to "providing a welcoming environment for all people, regardless of their gender identity or expression." He says the University is working to "promote a culture based on the pursuit of truth," and encourages all students to "come to understand the differences."

"We are a diverse community — and a multiracial one, and a multicultural one — and I think it is important to show the world how diverse our community is," DeGiulio told The Daily Targum. "When the majority of our community is made up of people who are not like you, being kind or respectful to them shouldn't be a requirement of you becoming a part of this community."

DeGiulio said the University has been working on the new policy for about a year. The goal, he said, is to provide safe spaces for students to learn about "the diverse experiences, emotions and viewpoints of people from all over the world."

Some students have expressed concern that the move will lead to students using pronouns other than he, she and it.

"People have a difficult time coming to grips with gender-neutral pronouns and the implications that they have for personal identity and freedom of conscience. This is not a solution; rather, this is a dangerous step backward," said Joshua K. Schank, an associate professor of sociology and women's and gender studies at Northwestern University. "It is also very difficult to know exactly how many people will be able to transition or how many students will actually use these pronouns."

The Daily Targum reached out to University of Maryland spokespeople multiple times to ask them about this issue, however, they declined to comment.

"We are trying to keep it as neutral and safe as possible because it is really important for our students to be respectful and kind to others," DeGiulio says.

The University of Maryland has also come under fire in the past for not being inclusive enough with LGBT students. In 2009, the University of Maryland became the first public institution on the Deep South to allow a gay students group to form on campus. However, at the time, students did not have a space on campus for students to use a restroom that matched their gender identity. In 2014, a student group began a campaign to create a transgender-inclusive restroom on campus, though the university refused to open the space for their group, citing privacy concerns. The group subsequently sued the University.

"These are huge victories for equality and the American civil rights movement; it just shows what happens when you stand up and put your shoulder to the wheel for your freedom and your rights and the rights of others," Josh Kuss, executive director of the Maryland Transgender Advocacy Coalition, told The Daily Targum. "My hope is that people who were afraid to get involved come out in droves now and be a part of the future."

DeGiulio told The Daily Targum that the University has no plans to discontinue the use of gender-neutral names, and that a committee has been set up to determine the best way to incorporate transgender students into the University's housing plans.

DeGiulio says the campus has long prided itself on diversity and inclusion, and this new policy is one of the many efforts the University has made to "encourage the campus community to embrace the diversity it represents."

"In many ways it's a cultural shift," he said. "People are becoming aware of and aware of the cultural impact that they have on this campus, as they walk through the doors of the campus that they walk into every single day."

DeGiulio said there have been only two cases in which this happened on the campus, at the Maryland Center for Student Development and at Frederick Douglass College in Baltimore.

DeGiulio added that the University recognizes "that there are those who may wish to use gender-neutral pronouns; however, we believe that the University should protect and respect the rights of everyone."

The American Psychological Association has clarified the issue of gender. According to the APA, gender can refer to one's "self-concept" or self

A woman is "disrespectful" to him if she fails to bow the knee to him in deference before him. She is "disrespectful" when she makes his every syllable the subject of a rebuke and a whisper, when she refuses to kneel.

You don't call her a "sir," you call her a "missus." And she's always a "mistress," because, you are told, no one should ever treat a man as though he were in fact a woman.

This was the thought process behind the idea of the "Lady Act" in the late 19th century, which allowed women into the work force when they were not married, and also allowed men to become professional men without being ordained priests.

The idea was that the very idea that men have to be priests to be considered full-fledged men is itself a kind of misogyny. If I am going to be called "Mr. Smith" by men I just can't afford to be thought of as a woman because women are seen by society as objects. And if I am going to be called a woman by men, I have to treat them as the same level of respect I would to a man, because, after all, who am I to be able to look in their eyes, to know if I am worthy of their respect? And if I am to be thought of as the equal of a man, I have to keep my distance.

This was the thinking behind the "Lady Act" in the late 19th century, which allowed women into the work force when they were not married, and also allowed men to become professional men without being ordained priests.

It was that level of distance from the man that was the key.

A woman who is too close to a man she wants to take under her wing is "disrespectful." A woman who does not keep her distance is, perhaps, "disrespectful." But the more contemptuous that woman is of the man she wants to entrust herself to, the more "respectful" she is to him. That's it. That's the deal.

In fact, this is how much this country still acts in 2016.

This is why Donald Trump feels the need to tell you that "there's somebody that sleeps with [his wife], and it's nobody's business but my business."

That "nobody's business but his business," I understand. But it's also a business. Or a family. Or a workplace. That "nobody's business but his business" is another layer of social and political meaning that needs to be peeled away from our politics, as well as what it means to have a family. The fact that Trump has a line of children he wants to talk about when talking about his business should not make a woman who wants to run his company more "disrespectful."

And the fact that he thinks it is "nobody's business" but his if he wants to talk about it means that the woman running his company should be treated with the same level of respect as he does, no?

In the world of the great and the good, it is assumed that the "disrespectful" female is a woman whom the male leader of your country would never dream of taking up an official position within or beyond the company of the male lead.

In the world of the great and the good, that's what a "mistress" is, and she is not a woman unless she is a woman in a marriage, unless she is a member of the church, unless she is a woman in professional or institutional life. So the idea that a woman, while technically a woman, can be just as disrespectful toward a man as she is to a man is ludicrous.

In the world of the great and the good, men are considered "disgusting

"I have one and one is all that matters": the difference between a 'real' artist and a 'fake' artist

By Tom Doyle

6 May 2013

What are your chances of finding an authentic artist when it comes to your art? We all want to be an artist, whether it is a hobby, an occupation or a serious hobby. We all want to be a real artist, but what is going to define what a truly great artist is – something that is real to the core?

There has been growing interest in the role of art and visual arts in education, both at a secondary school and at university level. The idea that there is a strong relationship between good education and art, as well as the role of artists in the creative life or economy, is not new. In fact, artists, such as Thomas Hodgskin in 1662, have been known to contribute to the formation and evolution of ideas.

What is new, however, is that the art museum collection in the UK, particularly at the British Museum and Tate galleries, now includes a much greater range of works from non-professional artisans, from those who work, at least in part, as artists – not professional artists – the 'real' artists.

The Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and the Tate galleries in London also boast more than 20,000 paintings, sculptures and drawings. The Museum of London boasts over 15,000.

The first British art museum, the Imperial Academy, was opened in London in 1818. In the 19th century, new institutions were being set up such as the Guggenheim, the Tate Modern and the British Academy for the Creative Arts. Between 1915 and 1916, these became part of the British Museum and the Guggenheim, respectively. They were the first British institutions to acquire works by emerging and established artists.

In the past 20 years, many museums have grown in size, and the number of works that are on view has increased. The number of art galleries also greatly increased, with major museums such as the British Museum becoming major centres for acquiring art.

For many artists, their careers are based on gaining their living for their art, and the more the more the greater the pressure to produce. A 'real' art history museum, therefore, needs many of the artists who have contributed to British art to be in it, and it needs as a museum the artists who will be contributing in the future. This, however, is not what many galleries are doing. The artists who do not fit, for whatever reason, into a gallery context do not fit inside the collection of the gallery. Some galleries continue to hold works from artists such as Frank Stella to show for those not in the galleries; but it is important to understand that gallery curators and curators rarely meet, and generally never interact with, artists who are in the majority of galleries.

In terms of collecting, the Museum of Modern Art is very interested in what it calls "cultural property," which includes paintings, sculptures, drawings, etc. It doesn't have an inventory, is not in contact with its collectors, and so does not have access to works.

While some galleries have a relationship with their collectors, it is in a very tenuous relationship, perhaps akin to a private relationship. Many of the works are held for those not in the gallery but who might wish to have one. In the case of a gallery, this usually means for a work by an emerging artist. Many gallery collectors cannot afford to buy works on the open market in the way that wealthy collectors can.

Many galleries take on an attitude of 'the people buying it are our art collectors'; whereas an open market is when the public can purchase the work.

This, of course, isn't really how auction houses run their business, and the idea that galleries are 'just art collectors' has been demonstrated to be a load of hooey as recently as February. It is not just galleries who do not have access to art, but also those who wish to purchase work; and when they do, the money generally goes into the coffers of the gallery. The gallery's sole aim is to make money from sales, and the fact that many galleries sell to the public and have galleries as distributors of work means that some things can only be exhibited in the gallery. A good example of this is the recent sale of a photograph of David Bowie taken in 1969 by photographer Terry O'Neill to the Royal Academy, which goes on show in the Tate Modern's photography exhibition, 'Beyond the Space Age'.

There are many galleries who, like the Guggenheim, don't have art galleries, but who have galleries as distributors of work that is also used as the basis for works by artists who are not in their catalogue. This is a further example of how we as a society have lost sight of just how important an artist is and how that artist's place is in the context of a collection

An important step as the HIV community seeks to have our voices heard on the national and international health spectrum, the Position Statement reflects what we have decided to say publicly regarding current patient issues regarding HIV care. While it does not represent an official stance of AAAAAAM, it is an attempt to offer a consistent perspective from the global HIV research, care, and advocacy community.

The Position Statement summarizes the concerns about HIV care articulated by people living with HIV, care providers and other professionals at AAAAAAM's Annual Meeting. "The primary complaint is the lack of access to and quality of care for people living with HIV," says Michael DeMeo, PhD, senior editor for AAAAAAM's AIDS Journal. "A lack of clarity at every turn from the U.S. government, international donors, and individual patients' organizations, has delayed patients' access to life-saving care."

The document goes on to describe a lack of quality information regarding the risks of not receiving effective HIV therapy. Patients have been forced to spend time and money researching medications that are not approved by their insurance and cannot be given to others, thereby putting their health in jeopardy. A lack of knowledge about HIV treatment may also deter young people from taking their medications and delaying progression of the disease.

Furthermore, the AAAI says that the current system of prescribing HIV drugs is inefficient and dangerous, leaving patients high and low risk in a precarious position with all the consequences of being on HIV meds and the consequences of not being on them. "HIV medications are highly effective at reducing the risk of transmission and have tremendous potential to alleviate the severe illness of people living with HIV," adds Jean-Pierre Després, MD, MPH, director, program evaluation and implementation, and chief, Clinical and Research, Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, AIDS Clinical Trials Network, National Institutes of Health (NIH). "However, many patients are not in a position to choose which medications they need, or cannot afford, so we need to change the way we prescribe medications and improve the management and monitoring of HIV medicine and care in the U.S. and globally."

In the past, people living with HIV have been the subject of stigma, racism and discrimination. It is the AAAAAAM's goal to address these issues by addressing what are sometimes called the "pink plates." The pink plates are the "hidden costs," those costs that the health care system may not have included in the bill of services, and it may not recognize or pay, and that the quality of the health care does not improve when a patient is paying for it himself.

"HIV/AIDS care in the U.S. is largely being delivered through the fragmented systems created to fulfill the federal government's mandates." says Joanne R. Fiedler, MB, PhD, Director, Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, AIDS Clinical Trials Network. "The U.S. government mandates that the same health care system in every state, at the same times of day, pay for the same same type of care in all states for the same patients. But not all health care plans treat a patient with HIV exactly alike. Some are more accepting of a person living with HIV, others are not. Many times, the provider must deal with discrimination and bias. For a patient with HIV, these two major causes of non-treatment and discrimination require our collective focus and collaboration to be made clear."

The Position Statement concludes with a call for the inclusion of the experiences and perspectives of people living with HIV, their loved ones and allies
======================================== SAMPLE 319 ========================================
This report contains a description of the characteristics of the population, the level of fertility and of net international migration, its age structure, economic activity, educational achievement, social participation and political engagement. This information is presented for the OECD countries as a whole and for the key indicators of the population of them. These include the age structure of the population, its fertility in relation to its birth rate, the sex ratio, the distribution of the age groups, its gender gap, its labour force participation rate and its income distribution profile. A description of the methodology is given.

Table on the level and characteristics of the population, age structure, fertility and net international migration (migration) for each country of the OECD

Age structure and fertility

The level and distribution of the working age population are determined by the age structure of the population. These include the average age of men and women, their expected numbers of children, their ages at which they would have their first birth, and the age difference between the age of their first birth and that of their expected sex partner(s). The average age of women is 15.3 years for OECD countries and 16.8 years for non-OECD countries. For women of child bearing age, the average age is 16.5 years. The proportion of women is higher in Nordic countries (19.3 and 20.8 respectively) with a male participation rate of around 80 percent. In comparison the OECD average is 19.9 percent for men and 30.9 percent for women. By 2064 the proportion of women will exceed the number of men in OECD countries to a greater extent than in non-OECD countries and non-European countries. There is a gender gap in the OECD (15.1 percent in 2015 and 16.6 percent by 2064). The gap is much more pronounced with respect to the expected first birth age of both sexes and the total number of children (16.4 versus 14.4 and 8.2 respectively).

The age profile of the workers in the population is also influenced by their age. A higher proportion of younger workers are found in countries with high fertility (low estimated fertility for women) as well as low immigration (low numbers of immigration migrants). The age pyramid shows that the working age population is most concentrated in Nordic countries (Germany, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Slovakia). The age profile of the population in Germany is strongly influenced by the high level of fertility which contributes to an increasing ratio of the population of women aged 25-34 to that of men aged 30-34 (the ratio reaches 17.0 in 2015).

When fertility is low, the male participation rate is still high (around 80-90 percent) even though the working age population is relatively lower. This is a common pattern in Nordic countries, as the gender gap in this case is larger than in the OECD as it is. Thus a higher proportion of women are found in these countries and the gender gap increases to around the same levels as the OECD. The level of gender participation also depends on the average number of babies per woman. For women, the highest participation rates are in Nordic countries (such as Sweden and Norway) where almost 80 percent of women have their first child before the age of 34 years and in the Czech Republic where around 70 percent of women have a baby before their 22nd birthday. The lowest levels of gender participation are found in the United States, France and Spain.

The level of net international migration has a considerable impact on the composition of the population of a country. When the level of net migration is high, the composition of the population reflects the age profile. For this reason the composition of the population in Germany is heavily influenced by the ageing population and the low mortality and is relatively low in contrast to the OECD average. The ratio between the aged working age population and the under-60 age population is the highest in Nordics countries (Germany, the Czech Republic and Sweden), in Nordic countries including Japan and the Philippines with a ratio of approximately 2.2. The age gap of the population is relatively low in Japan and the Philippines (less than 10 percentage points), in the United Kingdom with a ratio of approximately two (2.0) and in Spain with a ratio of 1.86. In the United States the number of population and its aged population is high which contributes to the low ratio between the ratio of old to young people and people of working age. In comparison, these three countries with relatively high aging populations account for approximately two-thirds of the total population and have a ratio of roughly 1.5.

The ratio between the age groups has more modest levels in Nordic countries (e.g. Sweden) and is significantly lower in the United Kingdom, Estonia, Mexico, Australia and Australia than in the OECD countries. The ratio of working age to the population aged 35 and over is about two in the United States, Denmark, Norway and Germany. The ratio of the population in the middle age group to the population aged between 35 and 39 and the

SUMMARY

A new method for the creation of high performance and reliable hybrid semiconductors has been developed by physicists from ETH and the Leibniz Institute of Solid State Research (WZ) in Germany. This method will help to greatly increase hybrid semiconductor performance while offering great power and mobility. The key aspect of the work is to produce superconductors with a highly uniform and homogeneous distribution of the magnetic dipoles and hence lower distortion. Furthermore, in comparison with other methods, we use a single, highly conductive material in high porosity, so high power devices using the new hybrid semiconductor materials will be even simpler and thus less delicate.

The most outstanding feature of this work is that it was performed using high-temperature solid state chemistry, which has so far been impossible to develop for highly magnetised materials. Previous hybrid semiconductor materials have had to rely on the presence of a small amount of superconductive material inside the material to drive magnetic reversals in order to achieve high superconductivity. But this tiny amount of superconductor reduces the size of the material and therefore the energy density of a material, making it very difficult to scale up to extremely large sizes. By contrast, the very uniform distribution of the magnetic dipole magnetic phases in the new work allows much better performance and thus lower operating temperature. This results in a much lower cost and hence lower costs of the new materials. The combination of such high performance and high mobility will also require the development of high performance electronics for the very large applications.<|endoftext|>New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady did not practice again Thursday because of back spasms. However, he played on Sunday against the Texans and appeared to be in good condition. With Brady back on the field, it looks like the Patriots will be able to make it through the first quarter of the AFC Championship against the Indianapolis Colts without their star quarterback, according to Mike Reiss of ESPN.

Tom Brady, who has been ruled out of the rest of the season, practiced Thursday after undergoing back, calf and hamstring spasms. Patriots team doctor Dr. James Andrews has ruled out any setback on Brady's condition and was hopeful that Brady would be ready for Sunday.

The Patriots would like to have the league's MVP under center, but injuries to both him and Aaron Hernandez have kept both sidelined for extended periods of time.<|endoftext|>The University of Houston's student-run newspaper recently endorsed an election system on the school's ballot initiative to allow third-party candidates to appear on the November ballot. With about 8,100 students, UH is one of the largest campus student bodies in the country.

The UH Independent, the student-run school newspaper, is backing a system of ranked-choice voting on the November ballot that would add more than 600,000 voter ranks to the already existing number of 4,290 ranked-choice-preferential ballots (RCP) which are distributed in every student government election. (READ: Why Ranked Choice Voting works)

The new system would give independent candidates a more meaningful opportunity to be elected by allowing voters who haven't indicated a preference in the first round of balloting to rank their choices in order of preference. It would also give all voters a chance to determine who represents the student body at the University of Houston.

UH Independent Editorial Board member Robert Niehoff stated in an editorial published Dec. 8, 2015, that the UH's third-party option as ranked-choice voting is one of his "top three ideas" the newspaper has to improve election administration.

"Ranked choice voting would allow multiple-choice answers and even more candidates on the ballot, helping us have a more representative voting body," he said.

Third-party candidate for UH student body president

Niehoff also stressed in the editorial that the endorsement by the student-run newspaper did not amount to an institutional backing of any candidate.

He noted that the support of the Independent's editorial board has nothing to do with any individual being endorsed by the board.

"As we have said before, we do not wish for candidates to be endorsed by our paper, and are not seeking to do so," Niehoff said.

He noted that the endorsement was not an automatic endorsement of any candidate for president. Rather, it was a decision made by the editorial board as an effort to bring new ideas to election administration.

"We feel that this could result in a stronger election system," he said. "Students, regardless of political party affiliation, have the power to rank as many candidates for elected office as they want, but it can be beneficial to rank-order them to make sure that you make your best candidate win."

The board endorsed candidates at least 30 times prior to this year's election, starting from the presidential election in 2014.

The newspaper endorsed President Judy Genshaft in a Nov. 28 editorial, as well as Sen. Charles Perry in a Nov. 30 editorial the same

The European Union and Turkey will continue "working constructively" as the two sides are still dealing with what was described as "significant political differences" following an announcement on Thursday outlining their future partnership.

EU leaders and Turkish officials discussed the future of the deal under which Ankara has been pledged billions in aid and visa concessions by the bloc in return for curbing the flow of migrants across its borders.

After a lengthy meeting of the EU's high representatives and their Turkish counterparts, EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said he hoped to be able to present a joint paper outlining the two sides' new relationship by the end of the week.

Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said that after the meeting, which had gone "well", they had made "significant progress".

His comments followed a surprise announcement by European Council president Donald Tusk, who said that negotiations on the future partnership were now entering "final stages".

"Today we said 'yes' to the European Union and Turkey. Tomorrow we start the final stages of the preparations for the next steps," Mr Tusk said after the talks.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mr Tusk confirmed the new partnership as they signed a joint declaration, adding that the first steps were going "well".

The EU has already proposed the Turkish presidency as part of the partnership, a role which Turkey has strongly resisted but which the EU hopes could be one that could open up accession talks and eventually trade talks.

With an estimated four million migrants coming to Europe since the start of 2015, Mr Erdogan has said a deal is "vital" for the country's future.

Following the announcement of the partnership, the European Commission said it would also launch preparatory discussions to "explore whether Turkey could become an EU candidate country" and "how the partnership could be made more ambitious".

The two sides have already been working on specific areas, including migration as well as the fight against terrorism, terrorism financing and people smuggling.

Mr Avramopoulos also said, "I will now hold regular contacts with Turkey in order to strengthen our collaboration in dealing with migration in the future". The EU has also vowed to speed up the deportation of illegal migrants with the agreement also including a "package" which would include support for Turkey to "restore" the rule of law, rule of law reform in Turkey and an investment plan worth €3 billion from the EU.

Speaking after the meeting, Mr Kiyikaz said that Turkey and the EU are in a position of "first choice" in the battle against refugees as the "only two countries on the front line who have not succumbed" to the refugee crisis.

Following the signing of the deal, Turkey's top diplomat said: "Today the world has been shocked with news of the breakthrough. And what they have just heard from Turkish authorities is a complete, reliable and factual account of the developments leading to this breakthrough."

"Today the world has been shocked with news of the breakthrough. And what they have just heard from Turkish authorities is a complete, reliable and factual account of the developments leading to this breakthrough."

Mr Kiyikaz said that Turkish and European officials had discussed the possibility of an EU summit on May 28 to mark the signing of the deal as they spoke, adding: "This summit will send a very strong message to the governments of Europe and to public opinion that the agreement will be implemented."

======================================== SAMPLE 322 ========================================
In the middle of the night on June 14th of last year, a young man and his wife were shot and killed on the doorstep of their home near the University of Texas at Austin. They had just gotten up to attend a party on their front porch, where they'd been enjoying themselves, when they were ambushed by four men. Two of the attackers opened fire on the two women, killing them both. Then, while one of the women was still trying to fight back, the man was shot in the neck, killing him.

In the midst of the attack, a third suspect shot and killed himself. In the immediate aftermath of this tragedy and the investigation that followed, I was asked by family friends to assist with a local police and homicide task force. After some time, when I saw the case for what it was, I decided to go public with this tragedy.

In the weeks and months since then I've learned first-hand of the challenges that law enforcement face when they go out and interview the public. Many witnesses are initially reluctant to talk to police, because they fear retribution from friends and neighbors, as well as because they don't know their legal rights. Others are reluctant to talk to police because they've found their trust in law enforcement to be misplaced, whether because of questionable practices or a perceived lack of transparency when it comes to official policy.

What you will find in my first book, Making a Murderer: The Case Against Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey was the stories of these witnesses and others, many of whom are now speaking out about the trauma they experienced, as well as the fear and frustration they have carried with them for a long time and continue to carry into this new century.


My hope is to help fill in some of the gaps in the information we currently have for some of these men and women, by showing the rest of us that the system of justice can work and can help bring these two men and two women home.

For my own part, it was a long journey for me to get to where we are today. At the outset of the course, the director of the criminal justice unit at the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggested that, in the name of the students and their families, I should begin this course with an essay on one of the men's and women's stories. So, on February 6, I wrote a short, brief essay, called "A Casebook for the Killer Next Door." As I wrote, I was overwhelmed with emotion and thought about the many ways in which Steven Avery, Brendan Dassey, their families, and all those who were affected could benefit from the perspective of witnesses who knew them. I wrote with an eye toward making this short essay as accessible as possible for those who wouldn't normally be a part of the legal system, and also for those who might take exception to a story or argument that I was making about the men and women who lived in this small town in Wisconsin. It was clear from my experiences and research from previous years that many police departments are extremely reluctant to interview people who have lived in similar communities, a phenomenon that I hope I could help change in my writing.


From the outset of this work on Making a Murderer, I've seen tremendous passion from family and friends, and from those around the world who support the families of Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. I have also read a number of blogs that have questioned the reliability and fairness of my sources and have gone on record to assert that I am in direct opposition to the legal system in this case. To them, I can say that my personal experiences have inspired me in the right way, and that my work on the Making a Murderer series has been the result of deep reflection and an investigation that included many hours and often many days spent with many individuals. I have also learned that our public institutions have far to go to become more transparent and accountable to the people they serve.

On October 22, 2014, in the wake of the release of the Netflix documentary series, I posted an article in The New York Times Magazine which summarized my experience in the criminal justice academy. I am in full support of the judicial system, public servants, and our entire legal system, including the media, and for that I hold nothing but high regard. I would just like to be able to talk about, at least occasionally, a few more of the people who live in the same small town in Wisconsin that I grew up in: Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. It's clear to me that most journalists are ignorant about the law, the justice process, and the people that they come across. What you will find in my first book, Making a Murderer: The Case Against Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey was the stories of these witnesses and others, many of whom are now speaking out about the trauma they experienced, as well as the fear and frustration they have carried with them for a long time and continue to carry into this new century.

I thank those who took the time

Image copyright PA Image caption Police said Mr Toms was stabbed to death outside his home

A man accused of killing a man after a row outside a nightclub has been found guilty of murder.

Andrew Toms, 22, from Ballymena, was stabbed outside the Club Inferno complex in Belfast.

The Old Bailey heard a trial in which the jury deliberated for five days before finding him guilty.

Toms, from north Belfast, was originally said to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time.

The 22-year-old, who did not apply for bail, has been charged with murder and other charges including possessing a dagger which caused grievous bodily harm.

In May, he was jailed for 12 years for stabbing a father of four to death at a house party in north Belfast.

Sentencing Toms at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Jay said: "At that time there were problems with the defendant in relation to his mental health issues and he had had some episodes.

In 2009, Mr Jay said, Toms, from Clogher, had had a mental breakdown after which his mother warned him to stay away from her home.

In 2012, while the court heard the court was investigating Toms' mental health, he was found at a police station on Thursday.

He had apparently thrown away his passport for an extended period of time.

'Struggling to come to terms with reality'

The court was told Toms had attended a police station on Tuesday morning after taking a taxi to the PSNI's station in the city on Tuesday night where police found his body.

Det Insp Sean Price said at the time: "The defendant was suffering from delusions at the time and was struggling to come to terms with reality and his actions, as is clear to anyone who attended or interacted with this man last night and for many months prior."

This tutorial is all about how to assemble a fully assembled 8-player games system on an Arduino Due, using only the components available on the board. You'll get a fully functioning game (without dice), and how to assemble the game, with step-by-step instructions and some assembly videos.

Getting Started

We're going to need the following items:

Arduino Due

12V 5a power supply

A display that runs on power

Arduino cable (or any other cable that you don't mind removing)

Power jack

4 "P" connectors

24 button pads

Possibly other components. The "P" connectors may also be soldered to the button pads

You may also want to buy a 4x4 wooden version of the display, if you're going to be painting your boards. I picked mine up for €5 at ebay.

Some time ago, you may also have needed to buy and install some "AoB" (Assemble to Block) jumper wires, which you'll need to remove once you're finished (see below). I suggest you use a small amount of flux-cored solder to do that; it's not a huge amount of work.

Getting Everything Together

I'm going to assume you've done the wiring step, that you're comfortable with wiring, and/or that you've read through the first six steps of this guide. If you have been thinking about this, you should have already.

You'll need to plug in your Arduino using the "AA" connection, and plug in your display using the "DP" connection. You will also need to connect your USB host cable to your machine (see the step-by-step instructions below), and plug in the power supply.

If you're following the "Simple" tutorial, you will need to connect the "AA" connection to Pin 12 (A1), and Pin 11 (A2) to Pin 2 (A5). This is because if you're already using a display like the Uno, there won't be any pins left for any other kind of display. If you choose to use the "Easy" tutorial above, you'll need to connect the "AA" connection to Pin 8 (B4), and Pin 6 (B9) to Pin 5.

Using our simple example, let's say you want to use this board for a "2-player" version of the "Space Invaders" arcade game. We'll want to connect P1 ("A0") and P2 ("A1") to "Pin 1 (A0) and Pin 8 (B6)". So we'll be using P1 ("A0") and P2 ("A1)", and so

The world's oceans are a lot bigger than we thought. The ocean holds more than 200 trillion tons of water compared to the 25 trillion tons we thought we had, scientists say in a study published in the journal Science.

That would make the oceans 10 times as big as the United States. That's quite a bit more water than, say, China, which holds 4.6 trillion tons of water.

Researchers analyzed 40 years of ocean measurements, and their results came up with the estimate of the water mass. The estimate depends on how scientists measure the ocean's density (how much water is concentrated in something compared to a dry desert), and not on how much water actually gets into the ocean.

In the study, they note that the world's oceans store only 6 percent of the world's energy but take up 90 percent of the globe's surface.

Oceanographers have observed an increase in water masses in recent years, especially since 1984. During that time, oceanographer Jeff Masters and oceanographer J.P. Ohlsson published a study indicating that the ocean's water contents have risen by 516 trillion liters, or 6 percent, over the past 30 years. At that rate, if the oceans continue to add water, that would mean that, one day, the seas might exceed 1.1 kilometers (0.6 miles) thick, they say.

Oceanographers have been studying the amount of water in the oceans because, at least in theory, understanding this vital force could save us from sea level rise.

Scientists measure the amount of water in various places by pulling out a small sample and measuring its density.

We have known about the water in the Atlantic Ocean for some time, but it was too big to be captured by a ship.

In the late 1970s, researchers figured out how to sink a small submersible, remotely operated by Masters's team, into the Atlantic. In 1986, they successfully sent it to a depth of 500 meters (1,640 feet), where it measured the water at a depth of 2,829 meters (9,072 feet). (That's a full 4 kilometers, or 2.5 miles).

The ocean has been getting larger since then because of the warming oceans. Since 1985, the water around each island has been getting warmer — and that expansion of water has also produced an increase in global temperature, which can in turn cause the oceans to get warmer.

Since 1986, scientists have been able to get better measurements of the water around islands.

That same year, oceanographer J.P. Ohlsson and others published the first estimate of all the masses currently in the world's oceans. At the time, Ohlsson also estimated the entire water sphere had a volume of more than 700,000 cubic kilometers (250,000 cubic miles).

The problem with oceanographers' prior estimates was that they came up with the number based on measurements of densities, rather than on water volume.

In the new study, Ohlsson and colleagues at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed data from the Global Oceans Atlas (GOA) and discovered that the water masses had actually increased by around 1 trillion liters (0.0001 percent).

They conclude, "At least a portion of the added water is going somewhere else — either into the deeper ocean or over land. The most likely contribution is water that's now over land."

The poll, conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), asked 1,016 evangelical Protestant pastors what percentage of their congregations support marriage equality.

Of that total, only 28 percent answered "a great deal" or "fair amount" of their congregants support marriage for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. (That would mean that 19 percent are in favor of all of these relationships and another 16 percent are in favor of only one particular type of relationship.)

A full 76 percent said they don't have a lot of their congregants support marriage for gay people.

"The data shows that it's not just that evangelicals differ on the issue," said PRRI President and CEO Robert P. Jones in a statement ahead of the new study release. "They differ sharply in what they think marriage means."

The study does point to two bright spots for evangelicals supporting gay marriage. On the one hand, 59 percent of millennials — those ages 18 to 31 — support marriage for gay

Tired of having to constantly find your way to your phone in order to check for updates, your phone bill, or your favorite movie?

Maybe you'll like taking pictures with your phone, but you can quickly forget what the shutter button does or how to use autofocus - with the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, you'll be using the optical image sensor and laser autofocus system together! But it won't come cheap: the standard iPhone 6s starts at $649 and can go up to $949, and there's an even more extreme option: the new $649 6s Plus.

Optical image sensor

The 6s (and 6s Plus) uses an optical image sensor (OIS) that can detect object, motion, and distance. These sensors are known for their ability to focus quickly, and this camera's is just as fast - it's able to focus and capture pictures on even the fastest moving objects.

This lens system combined with a laser autofocus system enables extremely accurate focus on just about everything, including people, faces, and small objects like coins or pencils. With the iPhone 6s, we've improved autofocus accuracy by 50%, making it so that subjects no longer move while you're focusing on them. There's also a new mode that detects your subject and lets you instantly shoot a photo using Live Photos as a bonus!

A special feature called Face ID

Face ID is a new biometric authentication system and one of the technologies that was used in the TrueDepth camera in the iPhone 7. It uses an infrared camera for depth image information and facial recognition technology to verify your identity. It is incredibly accurate and uses infrared light, unlike the typical contrast based techniques we use with touch sensors. That means the iPhone's camera will be able to detect objects around you even better than it does when it reads your fingerprints. The camera's sensitivity is even better, helping it see faces even in bright daylight, for more advanced scanning and identification.

New Camera

The iPhone's camera has improved for an exciting new year, with a new 12-megapixel iSight sensor featuring higher resolution and wider f/2.2 lens. Additionally, you'll have more control over shutter speed and ISO. And because this camera is so easy to use with Siri, you now have a better way to take stunning shots with just your voice. To access more of these camera settings, go into the settings menu under viewfinder.

Touch ID

Touch ID is a new biometric authentication technology that adds a touch sensor to the iPhone's home button. When combined with the Touch ID sensor, it's possible to unlock the phone with your face, hands, or face prints.

Touch ID works both with the Touch ID sensor and when Face ID is enabled. It is fast, convenient, and secure — and unlike a password, it is never sent to Apple. This is the only phone with Touch ID, so when Face ID is enabled, it is only available through Touch ID and Touch ID is secure.

A big leap forward in camera technology

You've probably got an idea on the best diet for you and your pet. But if you really wanted to know, how would you go about conducting an experiment to figure it all out?

That's exactly what our friend Dr. Susan Snyder, a veterinary cardiologist, has recently done with her pets. She has given them the option of following diets with no nutritional value or a specific nutrient profile.

Dr. Snyder then ran 12 experimental trials, comparing results. She found that dogs and other animals can make some intelligent, if not informed, decisions when faced with the prospect of a diet change. For dogs, she gave the option of eating the food they've always eaten, or a higher-protein diet. For cats, she gave the option to go low-fat or a low-carb diet – an option that was far different to what cats are accustomed to, because many cats have been raised on a meat-based diet.

How did she choose the experimental diets?

She had a series of groups follow either a commercial, no-frills vegan or meat-based diet for five consecutive days. These were the same food diets, but at two different times: on day one, the dogs were introduced to the food to find out what they liked and didn't like, but on day five, the dogs were offered a higher protein, high-fat, low-cholesterol diet, or a low-fat low-cholesterol diet.

Her goal was to determine how long it takes a dog to adjust to a diet change. By giving each dog a food diet, she discovered whether she, the owner or the pet food manufacturer had any influence on its behavior. She found that the animals didn't take long to become accustomed to a new food diet. That is, they were as happy and contented eating the diet as they were eating the previous one, and they ate the same number of calories per day.

The experiment revealed how quickly, and to what degree, the animal's digestive system can change its metabolism, and how long animals are able to adapt to a new diet. Dr. Snyder also wanted to show that animals can be made to change behaviors by their owner, but if they don't know what the food is and how the new food tastes, they may not eat it.

What do you think would come of this research?

"I thought the concept was interesting because it's not easy to do, even the most advanced nutrition studies," says Dr. Snyder. She's not sure if any other studies are on the horizon, and isn't sure what the implications are for dog owners as well as for pet food manufacturers. "We've just barely figured out how dogs digest and use food, and it will take some more work to understand the impact of different diets," she says.

Read more about the experiment and the results in Dr. Susan Snyder's recent article in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science.


What were the differences between the experimental diets?

She used a low-fat diet and a meat-rich diet, and found that both diets had the same impact on dogs; they consumed a similar number of calories and did not differ in their overall nutrient content. The only major differences between the diets were that the meat-rich diet contained more fat and protein, which may have encouraged dogs to seek their dinner outside, and had a more sweetened taste and was more salty.

What does this mean to dog owners? Do you have to eat a meat-centric diet, because your dog is going to need to?

Your dog has the right to choose what he/she eats, it's just a matter of what he/she has learned to love. You can be sure that it won't affect your dog – most of them never even learn if food has too many calories or not enough.

And although you might feel like your dog is getting a double dose of calories, a study shows that dogs with the same overall size, breed and age group, but from different breeds, also had the same body weight as the meat-based diet. They used a different feeding system, which made them more physically demanding, for which you may find that your dog is not ready.

Is this the same as giving a dog a taste test to see whether it wants to eat the food?

No. Dr. Snyder's "taste test" was designed to assess a potential change in food preference, and is not intended to compare foods between dogs or to determine the nutritional value of food.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Utah House voted down Wednesday an attempt by the legislature's majority Democrats to extend to 14 more years a ban on gay adoptions.

The vote was 49 Democrats and two Republicans opposed. It's unclear if Republican Gov. Gary Herbert will sign House Bill 2059, which would have brought gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning parents into the legal adoptee pool.

Supporters contend the law would have given an opportunity and a reason for gays and lesbians to adopt children, a view that opponents say is based on a "mischaracterization" of Utah's parental rights law that they say was intended to keep children in homes.

Utah's House and Senate are controlled by Republicans.

Utah was the first state to allow gay same-sex couples to adopt, in 1997. Before that a child in Utah could only be considered for adoption if the child already lived with a couple whose name matches the couple's.

Same-sex couples are barred from adopting in 29 states, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights.

QUEBEC CITY - The Quebec government plans to add new laws on Monday making it illegal to encourage people to buy or sell animal parts such as fur, horn, pelts and parts of wild birds.

A bill will be voted on as a government backgrounder, which means it will not face the usual Liberal-dominated committee process.

It proposes fines of up to $100,000 and up to two years in jail for violations of the new animal rights laws.

Quebec Environment Minister David Heurtel says no one can buy fur or products derived from animal parts in Quebec; he says that means the country as a whole should ban them.

The Quebec government is also proposing new regulations on the sale of parts of birds and other animals.

They include requiring that a licence have been issued by a judge to allow the purchase or sale of pelts or the skin of a dead animal and prohibiting the use of animal-derived products for cosmetic purposes.

Animal rights activists protested on Wednesday near the Pascale Leblanc-Regan Centre in Montreal where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will speak before the Quebec Legislature.

Trudeau said he hoped to hear more about the Quebec bill as it moves forward, adding if Quebec could enact such rules without having to negotiate the issue with Ottawa, Ontario and the Western provinces, it may be possible federally.

Trudeau is also expected to speak later that day at the International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper was asked Wednesday about the government saying it wanted to be sure that its new animal rights legislation was respected by the courts with regards to animals used in other countries.

Harper said Canada has always been a country where people should be able to make choices, but that the issue is complicated when it comes to animals.

He noted that Quebec had already moved to ban the use of live animal markets and have those markets shut down by 2017, adding that he was committed to ensuring Canadians in Quebec are not forced to trade in the product of cruelty in other countries.

Harper was speaking in Brampton, Ont., to mark Canada Day and to recognize it for the first time as an official day of commemoration.

Canada Day will be Tuesday, August 6.<|endoftext|>New Orleans Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry has reportedly been fired by the team following a 2-12 start that has many questioning if he should still be with the team. Gentry was with New Orleans for eight seasons before being fired after a disappointing 2013-14 campaign.

The team is currently looking for both a new head coach and general manager, and no one has been named for either of those jobs. The Pelicans fired Steve Kerr on Sunday after less than a year as the team's coach, and Gentry was let go after he made it known he considered retiring from coaching earlier in the season. But that is a far cry from firing Gentry for a poor season -- the team is just 1-6 on the year and has only two players on roster who were on the team last season: Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon. The team's bench is depleted, with the Pelicans bench having the NBA's fourth-worst average minutes per game at just 22.1 minutes per game. The team is also the only NBA franchise this season not to have an NBA Development League team.

"I can't speak for what's been going on with the organization," Gentry told reporters on Sunday. "What I can speak to is what I've known, and that is that I think the organization's made a decision, and I'm sure that's something that hasn't been well received by many people out there, or at least in the world. I thought things were headed in a better

Grimsby City councillors say the current proposal has been received poorly by the public, the police and council and is too costly to implement.

The council decided on Wednesday night to table the proposal to introduce a new development charge, the highest in the country, to generate extra funds for social care. The scheme will see the top rate of council tax to rise by a third from April to generate an estimated £2.3bn a year to fund care costs.

The proposed rate would be in addition to GLC, which currently covers care costs, which currently cost up to £17,500 per year per person. All but two local areas have GLC. Many other councils charge up to £12,000.

The Scottish government said the funding scheme would be more consistent in charging local area rates.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's reforms would ensure that health and social care bills are fairer, save money and help ensure that more care workers are paid.

"The new tax would be the first of its kind in the country – not only raising money but providing money which can fund care for the elderly and vulnerable," she said.

The proposed rate will raise an extra £50m a year for the Scottish Exchequer because of a £20m annual extra from bringing the highest rate closer to the UK average.

The new GLC would give every family a £4,000 tax rebate, with the money given to local councils to fund social care.

The new funding is in addition to the £1.5bn a year the Scottish Government says the Scottish parliament will receive this year and which it will use to fund health and social care. The health and care funding will come from the Department of Health's Personal Independence Payment scheme, which gives people with a personal care allowance for care, such as personal care assistants, some of their care costs covered.

It is intended to give people with low incomes more choice in the way their care is provided.

There had been previous concerns expressed from some councillors about how the new tax would be applied, particularly for small businesses.

However, a number of local council representatives said they remained convinced the changes were needed to support vulnerable families.

Councillor Lesley Hinds said she wanted to raise an extra £500m to support social care, saying she would oppose any change which would have been a waste of money.

Councillor Colin MacIsaac added: "While I understand that it is only one tax that will be taken into account, I do feel that there needs to be some consistency and fairness with that."

Labour council leader Andy Kerr said the decision to introduce a new scheme was premature given the recent referendum and the fact that Labour had agreed to devolve more power to Scotland.<|endoftext|>1.2

"Our nation is vulnerable. We live in a very dangerous world. Our borders are porous. There are people seeking to attack us. We must be prepared. The situation on the ground could not be more dire and the threats are growing by the day," said Cameron, who acknowledged that Russia could be planning to invade Ukraine's Crimea region and annex it immediately. "Right now our actions require the United States to support us. If only President Obama was willing to help us defend ourselves." At press time, British fighter jets had launched an airstrike across the Ukrainian border to try and stop Russia from sending in tanks.

SUN-TIMES MEDIA WIRE - A 27-year-old man was shot to death and another man wounded in West Rogers Park early Saturday in what authorities believe was a targeted attack, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

The shooting happened shortly after 2 a.m. in the 4900 block of West Belmont Avenue at the intersection of Belmont and Belmont, said Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Amina Greer.

Investigators determined that the pair were in a group of eight people "when an altercation took place" in the street before the gunman walked away with their weapon, Greer said. The shooting apparently occurred as other people arrived at the scene.

A man, who authorities would not identify, was shot in the neck and pronounced dead at the scene, Greer said. A 28-year-old man was fatally wounded in his upper leg and taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. The man whose death was ruled a homicide was listed in critical condition.

All of the victims suffered from gunshot wounds and were taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, authorities said.

The Cook County medical examiner's office has not yet released the names of the victims.

A $50,000 reward was issued for information leading to an arrest in the shooting.

An attorney representing the family of the deceased man declined comment Sunday on Monday.

The victims are believed to have been members of the same gang, Greer said.

An autopsy was scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday. No one had been charged as of Monday morning.

In an effort to make the Dallas Stars better, owner Tom Gaglardi's decision to bench struggling left wing Patrick Sharp, center Martin Hanzal and defenseman Alex Goligoski was not a shocking one.

Sharp, a former first-round pick, did little over the past five seasons to prove he belongs among the NHL's top players. Hanzal, a fifth-round pick in 2010, has been a disappointment since being acquired from the New York Rangers. Goligoski has rarely left the ice this season, and his play has been erratic and lackluster.

Still, it is difficult to say the Stars have to choose between one of their most important players and all their future franchise cornerstone forward, Jamie Benn.

General manager Jim Nill has stated he wants Hanzal and Goligoski retained, but with Benn still working hard to return from a broken foot, the Stars still might pursue a trade that would send both the 23-year-old Finn and their second-leading scorer — behind Patrick Eaves — to another Western Conference contender.

"They've played extremely well together, but they have a ton of chemistry together," NHL Network analyst Scott Burnside said of Hanzal and Goligoski's time on the power play. "Hanzal has a very good shot from that [left wing] spot, and I think their linemates have been great to them. I think they have had a good chemistry this season, and I think there's going to be a point or two where he can't keep up with [Goligoski]."

So what is the deal?

Nill said the Stars can't ignore their two top power-play shooters — even though both are injured — because they could be dealt this summer for another high-quality player.

"You always want to pick up your guys that are playing well, and when you do that, it makes the team more capable," Nill said. "It makes everyone around them better, so if there's a way we're going to get that talent, it's going to be by making a deal to bring our guys back."

The Stars need to address their top six forwards if they're going to improve upon a 24th-place finish in the Western Conference with 56 points. Eaves was in a contract year, and while he's scored 25 goals, he scored just nine in 61 games the past two seasons.

Goligoski — who has played nearly 28 minutes per game over the past two seasons — has been an elite defenseman in this league since he entered the league. He's played on the second power-play unit, and he's had the chance to move to third-line center.

Hanzal has been a reliable third-line center for the Stars since being acquired from the New York Rangers in 2011. But the 6-foot-3 forward has started to wear down a bit lately, and his role on the power play has diminished.

Still, the 33-year-old Swede has 15 goals and 51 points in 72 games last season. He has played in three straight All-Star Games, and he has played

While the Lumia 1320 was announced as a full Windows Phone 8.1 device at MWC in January, the Lumia 1520 has not been released at all – at least officially – and it is still unannounced. Now, it looks like Nokia may be looking to change that at the end of this month.

T-Mobile Insider has spotted pictures which allegedly show details of an upcoming Android-centric Lumia smartphone, code-named F8. Nokia is using Android to boost its revenue, according to our sources, so it makes some sense to explore the possibilities with Google. The T-Mobile insider also stated that there might be additional phones which will come preinstalled with the F8 OS and it is not certain if they would arrive alongside the Lumia 1520.

It is possible the F8 will be released alongside the Lumia 1520

As we previously reported, Nokia seems to be planning an even bigger splash at a couple of events taking place in Barcelona this month – one of them will be the MWC show. While we have only seen pictures of the Lumia 1520, and Nokia's new Android-centric phone is still unannounced, there is a lot of anticipation for this new Nokia flagship.

The US Senate last week narrowly passed a federal bill to allow states to impose new restrictions on "assault weapons" that lawmakers say have become too popular. The legislation is unlikely to become law, however, because it's unlikely to ever become law.

As a nation, the US has a long and proud tradition of having a debate over the nature of weapons with both sides in full view, and one doesn't need to look far to find examples of the kind of discussion Americans have over the nation's guns.

The earliest American guns were small muskets, the kind our young Republic would have been a joke to have had if it couldn't have had muskets. There was one problem, though, muskets were cumbersome and inconvenient to use, so they were eventually replaced by the lighter breech-loading weapons we know to this day. The early designs were also prone to malfunction, meaning every gun required a trained marksman.

What you have is a country with the second-lowest gun ownership in the developed world, and a gun violence problem no smaller than its crime rate because so many guns were already available in the early days.

The first serious attempts to restrict firearm ownership came in 1881. A law passed by Congress imposed a ten-year prohibition on the manufacture and sale of "any firearm which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel any other projectile by the action of an explosive."

This language was taken up soon after in the states around the country, and most states did just as they had done before. The next big attempt at gun control came in 1934 with the Gun Control Act of 1934. This law imposed a federal ban on semi-automatic guns as well as an registration scheme (which was later abandoned, thanks to the NRA) and the transfer of all firearms. (It's no coincidence some of the most deadly crimes involve semi-automatic weapons).

A few states were able to defy the federal government by passing laws of their own making. Nevada's law for example outlawed possession by anyone with a past conviction for a violent crime, or anyone holding a license to carry a pistol. Other states, such the District of Columbia, passed laws that restricted the sales of semi-automatic weapons to only state residents.

While these laws were supposed to prevent gun trafficking through federal law enforcement and to prevent the gun from being used in crimes, it didn't work out that way. After World War II, most gun rights advocates began to realize that the federal law was an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of the states themselves, and with the passage in 1942 of a federal law designed to regulate interstate commerce in firearms, there were signs that firearms law reform might be gaining momentum.

But this was about to be short-lived, as with the passage in 1947 of Fire

I recently got a chance to try a new line of supplements from Dr. Bose: the Bose Supersonic Tinnitus Solution. I have to say that I've never heard of anything like it.

I've been reading and hearing a lot about the subject of tinnitus for years, and I've found that the vast majority of the advice given is quite a bit old school. They've all talked about the basics.

My goal was to get some new recommendations. I wanted something with a bit of modern science at its core. I wanted to know what Dr. Bose has done in order to come up with this new product.

It took about two weeks, but the Bose Supersonic Tinnitus Solution arrived, and I am so pleased with it.

What Is Tinnitus And How Is It Treated?

Tinnitus is a temporary disturbance in the sound of your own voice. You might suffer from it once or twice a day, or you might suffer from it constantly. It ranges from a barely perceptible sound in the middle of the night to having to stop your own speech because it hurts (the latter is called ringing in the ears).

Tinnitus is usually a temporary disruption in a communication system that you're using, either because you're having a sudden earache or you're listening over-a-thong in a noisy subway car. When these people call 911, a few minutes later, they're no longer able to hear their voices. We often hear people refer to this as ringing in their ears, but that doesn't really capture the reality of it. Tinnitus is different. It's the sound of your own voice ringing in your head.

Although many people believe they have tinnitus and don't know it, the symptoms are usually very subtle and hard to notice. They might include pain in some area of the head, or a buzzing sound in the middle ear, or difficulty hearing the difference between a whisper and a scream. People with tinnitus often don't think about it unless they hear a sudden sound in the middle of the night or in the middle of a long conversation.

Tinnitus and ringing in the ears can be caused by hearing damage, stroke, or hearing loss. There are medications to treat it, including medications that target the tinnitus-producing nerve and/or medications that activate specific receptors.

Tinnitus Therapy For Anxiety

As I've discussed before, tinnitus is quite common. According to the National Institute for Mental Health, "the prevalence of tinnitus was 1.5% in the American population in 2017 [or 20 million people]. The prevalence was higher for men (1.7%) and women (1.5%), and for people without any hearing disability (1.1%), especially among older people."

In order to treat tinnitus, you first have to identify the underlying problem. Tinnitus has been identified as a very common problem (more than 75 percent of the time, tinnitus is more typical of women than men), and there are various therapies that can help.

There is no one perfect answer to treating tinnitus, and there are no silver bullets. However, there are a lot of different ways to alleviate tinnitus, and they work reasonably well for many people.

One of those is called "tinnitus management therapy." These are very small studies that have tried to identify what causes tinnitus and some sort of tinnitus control therapy. For example, there is the Tinnitus Neuroplasticity Approach which teaches your brain to "tune" or "modify a portion of the tinnitus signal," as shown below. However, there hasn't been much science showing tinnitus management therapy to be effective.

Tinnitus Management Therapies From a Research Perspective

Several studies have tried to use tinnitus therapy for anxiety. While some of the findings are promising, researchers haven't produced evidence about when and how tinnitus treatments might work for anxiety. I am hoping research such as this leads to the development of a better tinnitus treatment for anxiety.

In a recent discussion about the new iPhone 9, I noted one particularly useful feature of Apple's next mobile device: The new fingerprint sensor. The sensor provides an even higher level of security than the Touch ID sensor that's built into the iPhone 7.

What kind of security? I'm talking about the kind that makes you physically and mentally uncomfortable, of course. You may have a better idea of what that is.

A few weeks before iOS 9 was released last fall, security researchers showed how an attacker might brute-force the iPhone 8's Touch ID sensor. After learning the passcode required to get into the iPhone, the researcher showed that he could take advantage of the security hole that affects more than a million iPhone 8 models and force it to unlock within just a few seconds.

Now security researchers at Google have demonstrated that they can hack the iPhone 8's new fingerprint sensor using a different fingerprint-reading technique. Using a computer to scan the person's fingerprints and use them as keys for the new sensor, they can take advantage of the same "weaknesses" that the iPhone 8's Touch ID sensor can exploit. The technique is described in more details on the Google Security blog.

The Google attack works by bypassing the lock screen in the same way the "Practical cryptosystems" reference book uses the term: via a password.

What's unusual about the new attack is that it only requires a person's fingerprint. "Mostly this is because if you have a finger print, you'll have a higher security level than if you have a physical feature," wrote Google researcher Karsten Nohl, who works on the security team, in an e-mail. (Nohl is an Android security engineer.) "The fingerprint scanner is much cheaper than a face, so you need to use a low-cost feature instead of more expensive features like a facial recognition system."

What makes the attack novel, in the eyes of Google researchers, isn't just the ease with which it could be carried out -- it's that the researchers weren't limited to just Apple's fingerprint sensor. "It is possible that the same technique could be adapted against any device with facial recognition, biometrics or fingerprint support," the researchers said.

"Since the Apple camera is so powerful and is built into iPhones, most applications can leverage FaceID when it could also handle a fingerprint," wrote the researchers, who are part of Google's Project Zero.

If you're wondering what kind of password is required to open an iPhone, the answer for most devices can likely be guessed using brute force: something short that's easy to type such as "password" or "12345678."

For a device like an iPhone, this type of vulnerability is especially alarming because it allows a thief to unlock an iPhone without your knowledge, said Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University who was among those who criticized the iPhone 8's Touch ID fingerprint sensor. And Apple has said that the new fingerprint scanner can provide a password to unlock the phone within a couple of seconds.

"Even if the fingerprint scanner is secure, it still should be kept in your home because criminals will find it a very easy to use entry method," said Michael Wehner, a professor at George Washington University and an expert in privacy, surveillance and social engineering.

"I'm really bothered by a situation where the thief can use a biometric device, a device with a keypad and an entry method that uses your fingerprint," Green said. He noted that the FBI's use of Apple's device has been subject to complaints and legal action from privacy activists who say the law enforcement agency can access customers' encrypted data without a warrant that is tied to the individual.

"Apple's new biometric features are really useful, but they do not guarantee a high level of security," Wehner said. "The phone must be password protected or have an extra layer of authentication, which I view as a bad thing."

– Richard Mihalic, The Great Wall of China: How It Changed the World, 2014

In 1626, the first Chinese expedition to the wall was led by an Italian scholar. His mission was to map it. The result was a magnificent map which could have been part of England's Great Map. This map, known as the Zhengde map, helped change the course of world history. From then on, China's rise became unstoppable. The map and its description of the world became the most influential map of its time and the foundation for centuries of world maps.

In the centuries that followed the Zhengde map, Chinese scholars continued to explore. They used the same skills that had brought them to the Great Wall of China. But the Great Wall was different. At the time, Europeans had begun to explore the Americas to find the fabled New World, and these explorers took detailed land and sea maps. Chinese scholars still didn't know about the Americas, but many knew how to map it.

The Great Wall had long been abandoned by the Ming dynasty, a feudal society which lacked the funds to maintain it. Many people feared that if the wall were found to be a useless monument to the Ming dynasty, it would fall apart for many reasons.

Then, in 1949, it was discovered by a British explorer. This was the famous Sir Francis Drake, who had made his name as a seafarer and explorer. Drake wanted to chart out the new world, and decided to visit this place.

When he came to this place, he realized how much of a puzzle this wall was. The map that he had studied before the wall was no help in finding the Great Wall of China. As the Great Wall existed in the south, Drake had to take an incredibly long route through Mongolia and up to the north. He did manage to visit the center and map it.

The Great Wall in Jingdezhen in Inner Mongolia. The city that Drake visited had some of it's streets named after him.

What Drake saw on his expedition led him to study more about the wall and then discovered a few more interesting facts. The map which Drake had studied previously showed two sections of the wall. One section was about 100 miles long, and the other section was only ten miles long. This map was also the same size as the Zhengde map which had been put together by the same Italian, but its map was not the same. The one that Drake had studied looked to be the same size. This map showed that there were two sections on the west side of the wall, and three sections on the east side of the wall.

Drake was inspired by a French book which had shown the same map with a section on the north end of the Great Wall of China. Drake did not realize these two maps were different, but it made him wonder why this part was so different.

He realized the Great Wall of China was composed of many many, many lines and branches. It took him a month to map the wall, and found that this map was incorrect. He also discovered that there were many different directions that he needed to travel to get all the different parts of the wall.

For the rest of his life, Drake continued working on the map and discovered the many details of the Great Wall. And he also worked on the map for many years afterward because he found that many things on the map which no one had realized were missing!

It wasn't until 1978 that Drake, having learned the map in the Great Wall museum in Beijing, discovered the truth about the map in China. He returned to China and found that the map he had studied had had a number of errors. For example, on the north end of the Great Wall there was no place named China, just called "Great Wall." But on the south end, there was a China of the Ming government!

The Great Wall of China is now a museum in Beijing. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in China and the most visited national symbol in China. The Great Wall is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.<|endoftext|>"For many Americans it's not a big deal whether or not they have insurance. But they'd like to. And by not covering them and their families, companies get to collect premiums for a service they don't want them to use," Obama said in his weekly address.


"And insurance companies often keep those premiums for themselves with nothing extra to pay for them. Why? Well, because that's how insurance works, folks. It's not just the premiums. Insurance companies have to pay all this back to the government, so the only way they can stay in business is by taking out as much as possible on

The idea of the Pigeon Project started as a joke for our local dog. She would lay in bed after I was gone, and I used to joke that I would one day "take the bird out to the woods". She used it as a metaphor for when she wished she could do certain things, but wasn't allowed to. One of these things that was allowed was to leave my apartment. I said that I would give her a pigeon and she would leave and I would bring it back to our apartment and see if I could release it. We've been seeing her with a pigeon with us for the past six years.

The Bird Project is an initiative organized by Pigeon Project to put pigeons through daily and daily activities in order for them to become independent and then release them. The ultimate goal of this is for the pigeons to eventually be released back into the wild.

The birds that are at Pigeon Program are taken from their outdoor cages at a very young age. They are fed a mix of organic food, and other organic treats such as hay to meet their nutritional needs while they are still in birds' own environment, but are then kept in cages indoors and allowed limited outdoor time. It is difficult for them to cope with all of the distractions, noise, and changes in light for their freedom. Once the pigeons are old enough they are then taken to a special "Pigeon Training Center" so their new personalities can be exposed to new experiences and opportunities. Most birds that get sent to the Pigeon Program live with a group of other pigeon volunteers, and the program is a fun and stimulating experience for them.

One, and only time will I mention his name, was Bill Gates. The other one was Elon Musk, and the reason why he doesn't get quite as much press is because he is just a little bit less famous than someone who's in the same business as Gates or Tesla.

To put it in perspective, Gates is probably one of the most famous and powerful people alive, followed by Warren Buffet and John McAfee.

Elon Musk certainly has a lot of people talking.

He is not only the co-founder of Tesla, but also chairman and CEO of SpaceX and CEO of SolarCity. His other ventures have seen huge success such as SpaceX and SolarCity, but his most successful venture is the one behind Tesla and SpaceX, SolarCity. He is now on his way to being one of the richest entrepreneurs in the world.

While it might be true that in the eyes of most people that would make him the most powerful person alive, this does not mean that he wouldn't still make the list when discussing the most innovative and impressive electric vehicles ever created.

To put it simply, he is arguably the most powerful technology executive around right now.

That being said, let's get into it. We have compiled a list of the 10 most incredible electric vehicles that were ever built.

#10 – Volvo

One of the most iconic and well known Swedish vehicles ever produced is the Volvo 8040. It was produced as a result of a collaboration between Volvo Automobile and Volvo Design. It is still extremely popular today and currently sells close to 20k vehicles a year.

The reason it is so popular is because it was designed to look like a futuristic truck, which is something that people just love because it's so different from other vehicles we see today. There are also a few features that have stayed on the vehicle for a while now.

For example, it has LED headlamps, so drivers don't have to get out of the way while on the highway or have to switch them off for safety reasons, which is a benefit to many people. It also has the ability to take a full charge in just 16 minutes, which is fantastic to drive with a passenger in the front or the back of the car.

While a few people have been interested in buying this model, most people are more likely to keep it as an antique for its looks and for the fact that it only needs to be driven for 20k miles once a year to get the full $300 credit that it earns.

#9 – Audi TT RS 7

The 2009 Audi TT RS 7 was developed and manufactured by Bugatti, the car maker based near Provence, France. The car has been called the most expensive sports car ever built, and now sells for anywhere between $300,000 and $500,000.

The RS 7 is the successor to the 2009 Bugatti Veyron Super Sport. Bugatti wanted to create something very different for people that are looking to buy an extremely expensive sports car for a car enthusiast. It wanted to create something that the average person would feel is much more than just

The world of fantasy books, TV series and comics is often characterized by their vast casts of main characters and the variety of ways these characters might relate to each other. For decades, The Walking Dead has been one of the most influential fantasy books by focusing on its ensemble cast of characters who, despite not existing under a central, overarching story, form an intricate weave of plot, conflict and conflict-resolution.

And on Sunday, a different cast of characters from the series made their way to San Diego Comic-Con, where they were joined by an actress from the show, Lauren Cohan. The Walking Dead's fourth season wrapped last April with the introduction of the character of Melissa (who was played by Cohan). The actor, who was brought into The Walking Dead universe by showrunner Scott Gimple prior to the show's first season (where she acted as a series regular) made her first official appearance at the convention at a panel in which she was asked about what it's like being able to play an action woman who also happens to be in a TV show.

Cohan, who was recently seen in The Big Short, said she always has an idea of what action would be like if a woman was the main character instead of an action guy. She explained how the show has been a great outlet for her to learn how women should act on-screen (as well as what male writers can learn from her own experience), and she said what's important is that the writers of the series know that a woman can have an interesting and complex character to themselves.

"You know what? I think it's great in this day and age that it is okay for a young woman to act," Cohan added. "I think it's fun not just to get the action in but have the audience think the character's doing something different than what he just did."

RELATED: How the Walking Dead Season 4 Is Changing Things for Melissa

Though she didn't specifically discuss Cohan's Melissa story, she did note that she likes how the series has focused so much on relationships between the characters. She did describe how the new showrunner, Dave Erickson, is focusing a lot on "the family aspect" of the story.

"It's fun because the fans are doing a lot of really creative things," Cohan said of the show's fandom. "[The writers] are taking it all on and pushing the boundaries."

They're likely a thoughtful and generous and friendly person who simply asked a lot of questions and had a lot of questions.

But often, they were not. And that's when you can be the perfect role model.

You can say that your friend just asked a lot of questions and that if you think there's something that needs to be cleared up, you should be the one to get it cleared up.

You can say that the questions were about a very sensitive subject and that the person who asked them should be in control of their own mind and body and that this person is too close to the incident to be allowed to get away with bullying them.

You can say that what you know now makes it clear why someone asked, how the people involved responded, and how things would have been different if they had been in control of their own mind and body, not an unsupervised person.

You can say that this is, in fact, an opportunity for you to learn something in a way that no one else has heard that might help you help them — and that you've been in a situation before where you were able to help someone and they did the right thing by you.

You can say that you know that the person should know that their safety and peace of mind, especially if their behavior is to ask questions about their own safety and peace of mind, can best be maintained by themselves, in order for them to make the best decisions possible; this is not a request to see if their friend would be willing to have one individual in charge over them. This is just asking you to respect this person's wishes in the interests of safety and peace of mind. And it's asking you to make sure that they understand that their wishes don't apply to this situation as it exists right now in this situation, that you are not their therapist.

You can say, again, that this is a conversation that no one on your side is able to do. This person does not know you and is making these demands on you as a friend. Ask them to take any further steps toward clearing up any potential confusion and they cannot be forced to; they have to take

The following table summarizes the major changes to the law that will take effect September 1, 2016, when the Act takes effect.

All of this change was passed in 2016, when the Act passed the Assembly, but was not signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown. However, it only took effect the day the bill passed the Assembly. (The Governor signed it into law on June 14, 2016, although many California voters approved it in November.)

Here is a look at the provisions of the legislation. Keep in mind that many of these changes will be phased in gradually. If you're planning to register to vote before August 1, you have until September 1 to register on state forms. And if you are not already registered, you will need to register right away to have your voter registration processed. The Act also gives local governments and certain public institutions, such as community colleges, the ability to create their own voter registration.

The following table summarizes the major changes to the law that will take effect September 1, 2016, when the Act takes effect:

Voting at the ballot box

All of the changes have one thing in common: they will allow people to vote at the ballot box—for example, at the polling place (in person) where they are registered to vote. Currently, in California, anyone who does not live in a house and does not maintain a physical address in the state is not allowed to vote at the ballot box.

Changes that will be effective on September 1, 2016:

California voters can vote at the polling place where they are registered to vote.

People who are disabled, under 18, or out of the country will be able to vote by absentee ballot, if a county makes an appointment for them to do so. These people are eligible to vote absent themselves from their home county in order to vote the absentee ballot in another county.

People who are registered to vote with a California driver license or a state ID card can now request to see their driver license to vote, for example, if they are visiting California. These people do not need to show valid identification to vote.

All voters can vote at the ballot box.

Eligibility to vote by mail

People who are eligible to vote by mail—that is, those who are 18, who have not moved since the last election, and who are not incarcerated or on parole—are no longer required to mail in their ballot in order to be allowed to vote.

Changes that will be effective September 1, 2016:

Eligibility to vote by mail will be extended to the following people:

eligible military personnel

an applicant for naturalization

citizens of the United States and Mexico who have been living abroad for 12 years and are in the state of California on the effective date of the law.

If those individuals already are voting by absentee ballot, they will simply be able to vote their absentee vote.

The following changes will not take effect until September 1, 2016:

citizens and persons who have been in the United States less than 12 months on the day before the election, on the effective date of the law.

any applicant for political office.

eligible members of the uniformed services.

Any voter without a California driver's license or state ID card or the legal age to vote can vote by absentee ballot until the day before the Election Day (by mail). To request an absentee ballot in person, send an application to your county clerk of the month prior to the election, by August 15th (by election day). To vote by absentee ballot, you must cast your ballot before the day of the election.

How you register to vote

There are two ways you can register to vote:

online

by mail

To register online:

On the California Secretary of State website you will find information about your state or country of citizenship, your signature, photo ID, and the type of document you can present. Click "Create or Renew a Voter Registration Card" to complete your registration.

For a complete list of requirements at the local level, see the instructions in each guide in the Secretary of State's online database.

For a complete list of requirements at the state level, see the California Voter Information Guide under the "Voter Registration" tab on the "California Elections" page of this website.

To find your polling place, go to the CA Voting website.

To complete or update your registration, go to your county clerk's office on January 22, 2017. Note: It's very important to use the "Voter Information" section of the website to confirm that your information is correct (and that you will be allowed to vote if you are registered). You will be asked to register by phone as well, but not by email, as is the case with many other voter registration providers.

For more information, contact your county clerk of the county in which your current

A woman who was injured today in a hit-and-run collision in Scarborough has died of her injuries.

The woman and her male companion were crossing the street near St Clair Avenue near St Clair West at about 7.30pm when a red car, possibly a Mazda 3, made a left-hand turn and ran into the woman's companion, the force of the impact knocking him down.

He was airlifted to hospital but died a short time later.

A red car believed to be a Mazda 3 left the scene.

The woman and her male companion were crossing the street near St Clair Avenue near St Clair West at about 7.30pm when a red car, possibly a Mazda 3, made a left-hand turn and ran into the woman's companion, the force of the impact knocking him down.

His body was discovered by two female witnesses, who called for help.

Police were called to the scene by the two female witnesses, although police officers were not immediately able to contact the two men involved, because the woman was lying on the ground.

An officer in attendance observed the woman and her companion fall into the street and he ran over and immediately started performing CPR.

The emergency services were then called and the officers went into the street with the woman.

Eaton Centre is expected to open before the end of this year and the street is part of Yorkdale Shopping Centre.

The project is a major upgrade to the area, which has been described as a "vacant wasteland" by one local resident.

The new construction has not prevented the presence of vandals and trespassing, which police are currently investigating.

The 30-second TV spot, released Monday, says "President in your pocket."

"Secretary Clinton has been through it. She knows how to lead. She knows how to secure America. And you know who else knows how to secure America ? All the American presidents before her," the narrator says.

The ad was produced by Democratic-leaning groups and is airing in battleground states, according to the group American Bridge. It also targets Trump's repeated criticism of Clinton, his criticism of the federal judge overseeing Trump University and his insistence the U.S. would not have won the war in Iraq if she had been elected.

An "A" rating from the Better Business Bureau gives Clinton a solid overall score of 96. "B" grade, according to the same rating, shows poor business practices with a "C" rating and is given to companies that had a poor customer service, poor compensation for employees or were generally unreliable.

On March 31, the Obama administration denied a request from the GOP to reopen a probe into Clinton's mishandling of classified information while she was secretary of state.<|endoftext|>What's up.

Marlon Humphrey knows he's no Greg Hardy. He's a sixth round pick who is one of three safeties considered for this year's draft. I talked to Humphrey on Tuesday after he completed his first rookie minicamp with the Falcons. For the uninitiated, you can read about and watch highlights of Humphrey's first six seasons at Kentucky here.

"A lot of people expect me to be like a Greg Hardy," Humphrey said. "They expect me to run over people and do all that type of stuff."

I asked him how he thought about that from afar, especially when they first met.

"That's not me," he said. "I can't control the type of players I'm going against, the speed of the players, the physicality of the players. It's all up to [the] refs, but at the same time I don't let that affect me if I'm being treated like a rookie and doing all that stuff. I just try to keep it to me, and stay locked that I've got to keep playing, I have to play for my team, because if I'm not playing, there's going to be disappointment for the next year."

It's going to be a tall obstacle to push through with so little experience. It's especially tough when it's a rookie trying to win an starting job in the NFL. For now, there's just his team and the football.

======================================== SAMPLE 339 ========================================
The idea of an automated parking system is not without precedent. For decades, parking-enforcement officers have used a variety of automated devices to record the license plate numbers of motorists who park in spaces reserved for public use.

The recent development of the parking-enforcement system, announced earlier this month in the Department of Motor Vehicles's parking-enforcement report, marks the first time that a statewide automated parking system has been contemplated.

If and when it is established, automated parking will be similar to traffic enforcement cameras, with the driver required to pay a fee at a meter before the parking space is given to the vehicle for which the tag numbers belong.

The state will contract the use of these automated machines from various companies and organizations, which will operate the cameras for the program.

An automatic parking system is part of an array of changes that have taken place over the past 20 years at the DMV. The number of parking-enforcement officers is being reduced, and the agency has become a player in the transportation technology industry.

The DMV issued the parking-enforcement report this month in response to a request from the Legislature in 2002 for the establishment of a comprehensive state program regarding motor vehicle parking.

In the report, the DMV recommended establishing a statewide parking-enforcement program. Under the policy, it would issue parking-enforcement tickets to the owners and operators of private garages when a motorist fails to return to an authorized vehicle after parking for longer than 30 minutes — a period, according to the report, intended to be sufficient so the parking space is reclaimed by another occupant.

The report also recommended that the public be able to view the license plates of vehicles parked on the premises of private garages, and that the owner and operator of an illegal parking spot be charged for that property.

To operate the automated systems, the DMV has contracted with one of four companies: AccuVision, a company that builds automated parking devices; GeoLit, a company in Ann Arbor that designs the computer processing equipment required to operate the machines; Autoliv, a company, which is building the system in Detroit; and Cota, a manufacturer of automated parking cameras.

GeoLit developed a system called "LiteView" that can take a picture of the license plate, the registration sticker, and the interior of the vehicle before writing any information or taking a picture. In addition to the "LiteView," the DMV is also interested in the Automatic Vending System system.

With the technology available, the automatic parking system would require an operator to look up the license plate number of every vehicle parked on the parking lot — a process that takes between 20 and 30 seconds.

The automated systems can be accessed by a law enforcement officer from within 30 feet, with the operator then holding the system with the key fob in the operator's left hand and turning on the key.

Under the proposed system, the license plate number will be recorded on a computer screen similar to the one used to photograph a vehicle to determine the proper registration status. During the scan, the computer will detect when the license plate is lifted from the ground by a vehicle. If the plate is lifted by an unauthorized vehicle, the system will activate.

If the license plate is lifted by an authorized vehicle, a camera with a digital camera that can capture three images in rapid sequence and one in a panoramic setting will take a picture of the plate and the operator in that vehicle.

The camera will then record the license plate number, and the operator will have to pay a fee that covers the cost of the machine for three periods of 30 minutes each.

The fee varies on different garages where the system is put into operation. For instance, the fee for a garage that has more than 4,000 spaces is $15 to $20 for 3 hours. If the garage has less than 4,000 spaces, the monthly fee is $6.

The $15 fee would include a daily record of all the license plates, which will be maintained for seven years by the department. According to the report, this information would be provided to law enforcement when a violation is detected on the property.

Agency spokesman Jason Gennaro said that the department intends to seek approval from the Michigan Government Operations Council to obtain the license plate scanner.

Gennaro said there are a number of concerns, however, that will need to be addressed before the license plate scanner is developed.

"It's just going to be an initial step," Gennaro said of the agency's plans. "Once we get the permit from the GMOC, we'll be able to look at all the options."

In addition to getting approval by the GMOC to use the scanner, Gennaro said that officials also must meet with various stakeholders, including other agencies and private companies including parking-enforcement companies that are located in the Lansing area.

Gennaro said he believes the agency is well positioned to

The Obama administration on Monday released revised data on U.S. gun sales—a year after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and other federal officials initially said illegal guns were flowing through an online portal.

A White House official said the updated figures—which show the number of transactions in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System from July 2012 through Feb. 27—represent "a meaningful improvement" from the first figures provided in April 2013, but he did not indicate which categories have seen changes.

"There are some clear shifts in the data, like the significant number of background checks completed more recently with more information," the official said.

ATF officials said last year that "some illegal firearms" had been recovered at crime scenes, but have refused to release the specifics.

The agency said in April 2013 that it would make the revised figures public. But the ATF subsequently said the agency had no idea when the new information would be released.

"We're still looking at a schedule for it being released," ATF spokesperson Deborah Sherman told The Daily Beast.

"We're doing our best to get something out," she said.

The number of background checks completed each week has remained relatively consistent since 2010, when it was just a few thousand checks per week.

But the number of background checks received by federal law enforcement has dropped almost 25 percent in the past six years, from roughly 70 percent of the total checks completed in 2010 to around 55 percent in 2013, according to DOJ data.

And there are some new details: For the first time, the number of firearms transactions reported by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System—the online system the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives uses to check whether prospective buyers have been disqualified from buying firearms—is available for 2013, according to the NICS.

The number of checks received by law enforcement for 2013 has gone up by nearly 20 percent, from more than 5 million completed to nearly 6.3 million completed in 2013.

Sherman said ATF officials are still trying to "figure out" which checks were completed in other states.

But it appears that at least one state—Arizona—has reported that more people completed background checks in 2013 than were employed in 2009.

ATF officials declined to comment on the discrepancy.

The Obama administration has in the past argued that the number of checks is a reliable indicator of firearms sales in the country. But for the past two years, the administration has been reluctant to release details about illegal gun purchases, prompting lawmakers on the left to criticize such silence.

"Instead of providing the American people with information about the millions of background checks conducted each month, the administration is hiding the truth," said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "The American people need to know how easy guns are to buy in this country."

"The administration has made clear that the number of guns on America's streets will not fall unless we take action—and as usual these numbers are hiding details that allow for a complete picture," said Senator Charles Schumer.

"It is deeply disturbing that the number of prohibited weapons sold through NICS went up more than 25 percent this past year. And it turns out that these new data may suggest a big problem," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein.<|endoftext|>What is "the most dangerous country on earth"?

(NaturalNews) When a "world authority" like the, which is supposed to "advise" the U.S. on foreign affairs, declares that Pakistan is "the most dangerous country on earth ," that is not the sort of assessment you want to hear from a "world authority."That's because, according to the "world authority," the "most dangerous country on Earth" is Saudi Arabia.Yes, you read that right. Just in case you thought the "world authority" was kidding or trying to keep information a secret, the "world authority" claims that Saudi Arabia is the "most dangerous country on Earth." The same country that routinely kills women and children in the streets, engages in rape, beheadings, crucifixions, the burning of homosexuals and countless other atrocities.As reported by, an authoritative body that has been in charge of issuing the "most dangerous country" ranking since the early 1990s, Saudi Arabia scored 727 on the global index of "state of security violence against women and girls." That is in comparison to countries like Bangladesh, Honduras and Nepal, which score an average of just 39.The world authority claimed that Pakistan's state of security violence against women and girls is much worse, stating that there have been, according to Amnesty International, "almost 60 reported incidents of violence against women in Pakistan this year alone, and as many as 1,400 attacks since 2008." But the "world authority," like the rest of the mainstream media , does not even bother to look critically at the actual source of the figures.The "world authority," which has

Cannabis is an illegal drug in the United States that can be used for many different medical treatments, and marijuana has been used for thousands of years for its ability to relieve the pain, nausea, and other symptoms that come with cancer treatment, chemotherapy, epilepsy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases.

Marijuana use is currently at an all-time high in the States according to several studies. Some 70 million Americans use marijuana on a regular basis, and marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug by young people. More than 6 million states and the nation's capital have some form of medical marijuana laws in place.

Research has determined that the active constituents of cannabis are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component, and cannabidiol (CBD), which has many anti-inflammatory properties without causing dependence. Medical marijuana is also able to act on tumor growth by inhibiting the growth of blood vessels and enzymes that are involved in making blood cells, which causes them to shrink and shrink, and also reduces the amount of oxygen absorbed by the tumor cells.

It is also believed that the cannabinoids may be able to prevent cancer cells from growing in certain types of tissue, which could in turn protect against metastasis.

Marijuana Can Treat Cancer and Pain

Cannabis can be used in several different ways for treating cancer pain and inflammation, as well as other medical conditions.

It has been found that THC can relieve pain and inflammation in a particular type of muscle called spasticity after surgery. Spasticity is a very common ailment with patients who have had spinal surgeries, and patients may suffer from an array of symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking, stiffness, involuntary leg movements, and difficulty with breathing. THC effectively works to stop the spasticity, which relieves patients' spasticity.

In a study published in The American Journal of Cancer Care published in November 2014, the researchers observed that marijuana caused a decrease in the size of cancer-related lesions in mice. These researchers found that both cancer cells that are found in different tissues and non-cancerous cells were reduced in size in the treated mice compared to the mice treated with morphine. This means that THC may reduce the tumor growth, which may be beneficial in controlling the spread of tumors in the body.

Although the amount and type of THC used in this study was small, this research suggests that THC can significantly reduce the growth of cancer cells, which can help treat pain and inflammation that are part of many cancers.

A study published in the Journal of Toxicology in November 2014 found that THC has anti-inflammatory and painkilling functions in mice, as well as decreased the growth of lung cancer.

Cannabinoids May Treat Cancer in Several Ways

Another study published in December 2016 investigated the effects of cannabinoids on metastatic prostate cancer metastases in mice. This study found that cannabinoids are both anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory, and they are able to help reduce metastatic metastases in mice.

A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that THC had an effect in reducing the growth of cancer cells in a specific part of a mouse's intestine. It was also found that cannabinoids have no effect other than reducing stomach cancer growth, which is another form of cancer.

Cannabinoids Can also Reverse the Body's Response to Cancer Treatment

Another study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that cannabinoids can reduce the immune system responses of colon cancer cells by increasing the expression of the molecules and enzymes that are required to keep the immune system in balance.

A 2013 publication in The Journal of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology found that cannabinoids reduce tumor growth and spread in laboratory animals by reducing invasion of cancer cells and their ability to thrive.

Another study published in The American Journal of Medical Genetics found that cannabinoids can increase the immune response, which decreases metastatic cancer, thus decreasing the incidence of the ailment.

A study in The Journal of Molecular Oncology in 2012 found that cannabinoids reduce tumor growth with only the administration of a chemical called CBN (cannabidiol). CBN is thought to act by inhibiting tumor growth by slowing its growth, increasing its internal permeability and preventing cancer cells from attaching to it.

What Are the Side Effects of Using Marijuana for Cancer Treatment?

Cannabis is also effective in treating many conditions, including:

CNS inflammation

Headache and other problems

Seizures

Diabetes

Glaucoma

Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis

Alzheimer's and other psychiatric conditions

Epidermolysis bullosa, and other skin diseases

Painful conditions such as migrain

Florida State University's College of Media and Entertainment recently hosted a panel on "Fifty Shades of Grey," and student film critic Brian Ritchie asked the panel why there was a movie in theaters, despite the controversial subject matter.

"You don't have a book," one panel member said. "Are you going to make this about the book as much as the book makes you feel uncomfortable?"

The panelist explained that the decision to release the film in theaters had more to do with the content than with the law school's film studies program.

"We have a lot of things we try to avoid when we make movies," he said. "But when something like that comes up, when there is something like that like 'Fifty Shades of Grey' out there and I'm going to look this up on the internet and I have found something I've never seen in my entire life, I thought that we should take the opportunity to educate ourselves before we even get in front of people that actually know what is going on."

One of the panelists, David M. R. Harris, a senior lecturer in the media studies program, responded by saying that the movie wouldn't have been pulled if he had the opportunity to distribute the film.

"One of the best reasons we have the First Amendment is to allow artists to create anything they want," he said. "The best way to deal with censorship is to let them do it."

The panel also announced that FSU's student government has been notified about the film's cancellation.

The event, entitled "Halloween on Capitol Hill," was hosted by the FSU Young Americans for Liberty chapter that promotes a non-interventionist foreign policy and a free market system.

On October 31, the school's chapter of the College Republicans posted an event on their Facebook page for the event titled "Movies: Fifty Shades of Grey is not an appropriate movie for Florida State University."

On the same day, the College Democrats were scheduled to host a movie on Halloween in their official Facebook page. They wrote that while the film would have probably gone up anyways, the event was cancelled because of the controversy surrounding it.

The event was later taken down, but the students still put up new pages for it.

On their Facebook page for the event, the college Democrats announced that the group had canceled the movie. Although, the group had the option to continue hosting the movie for the following week, the events of October 31 only allowed for the event to take place on the second Friday in November.

"It would be inappropriate for us to present a movie on Halloween, when the entire campus community is supposed to be out partying, to the community as a whole who are working and learning," the Facebook group wrote.

The group also noted that the movie and the panel had received "a great response," and the school had shown a film trailer to the student body on November 2.<|endoftext|>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Student Government Association has launched the Student Government Vote! Project, which allows students to vote on the direction of their organization. The project is open now until mid-January and students will be able to vote on three issues.

The first is to approve a new logo and colors. This can be done by filling in a form and giving students in the group a chance to vote on it. The second is to choose the new name for their Student Government Association (SGSA). This name change will not take place until April 1. In March, SGSA's current name, the N-Statesmen, will be dropped and a new name will be drafted that is better reflect their mission and mission statement. The final choice is how the SGSA will select a leader to serve as student representative for the upcoming summer and fall semester.

This project allows students to put their ideas to the government at large and the SGSA is excited to give them the opportunity to put their thought into the policy making process, but also provides many other opportunities.

"We see this as an opportunity to empower students, especially underrepresented students and students of color and give them a voice in the governing body that has influence on the rest of the campus," said Ashley Gouda, a sophomore and the

The United States has "all the tools" in its arsenal to destroy the Daesh (ISIS, ISIL) terror group, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Wednesday in Riyadh, where he held talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Prince Mohammed met Trump at the White House Tuesday morning for the third such meeting in eight days, despite the president's stated desire to avoid getting involved in the Syrian conflict.

"Yes, all the tools are at our disposal to push back against terrorist threats such as terrorism, and Daesh (ISIS, ISIL) is the greatest of those," the Saudi crown prince said in a speech he delivered Wednesday at the King Khalid University in Riyadh, according to Saudi media agency SPA.

In response to a question from a reporter about how his country could fight against IS, Prince Mohammed said Washington needed to support the effort by "Arab countries, countries in the region as of today" and help coordinate the fight against IS.

Daesh is another name for the group of Islamic extremists that control large parts of Syria and Iraq.

At the press conference after the three-hour talks Tuesday night between Prince Mohammed and Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a senior State Department official and several members of Trump's national security team, Trump declined to offer more specific details about his talks with the Saudi crown prince, instead citing his "very good relationship" with the Saudis.

The U.S. president later tweeted his opinion about the Saudi role in combating Daesh, saying: "The fact that Saudi Arabia is now fighting Daesh [ISIS] is a great thing. We are considering, as we work with all nations, taking in-kind support" from Saudi Arabia.

"We are considering massive in-kind support for the Saudi fight against Daesh, including intelligence, military and otherwise," Trump also said.

He also appeared to hint in his tweet of an alliance with Israel in the fight against the group.

"The US supports Israel in its battle with terror," the president tweeted.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting IS in Yemen was previously criticized by some lawmakers as being too focused on battling the Houthi group of armed rebels rather than the al Qaeda-linked group.

President Trump, who has been critical of his predecessor's approach to the Middle East, has also accused Iran of being complicit in IS.

On Saturday in Brussels, he also appeared to say that he believes Saudi Arabia was complicit when it didn't stop the funding of IS and other terrorist groups in the region.

"They didn't stop 911, they didn't prevent 7/7, they didn't stop the World Trade Center," Trump said. "They didn't stop the Pentagon and they didn't stop the World Trade Center. They didn't stop the planes coming into the Pentagon. Nobody gave them any credit for it. And they're not giving credit right now for stopping them."

Trump has been critical of Iran during his trip.

Speaking in Riyadh, Trump said that the Islamic Republic, a regime that has pursued an aggressive regional military policy, was taking advantage of the situation in Yemen and the region to advance its global expansionist goals, according to SPA.

"We can no longer be silent about this threat," he added. "We cannot accept Tehran playing with fire. Period."

Iranian Ambassador to the U.S. Daniel Lewis tweeted that Trump's speech on Iran was "misleading":

Trump's speech today was misleading. It said Iran has "been sanctioned" but didn't explain the sanctions (which have been on the books for years) & said that Iran is playing with matches and is "taking advantage" #RiyadhRiots https://t.co/1jhZH5qQf8 — Daniel J. Lewis (@AmbLewis) May 20, 2017

The Saudi-led coalition, which Saudi Arabia maintains is fighting IS in Syria and Yemen, is also targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels and their allies.

The Saudi-led coalition, which is supported by other Arab states such as Egypt, also launched airstrikes in Yemen in March 2015 to support an Arab-led military intervention against Houthi rebels.

An international team of scientists from the US and Germany have developed a prototype device capable of accurately reading the body's electrical signals to detect cancer in patients before they have symptoms.


The team, led by Professor David Sinclair of the University of California, Los Angeles, has successfully created an accurate biosensor that can detect the body's immune system's signature of a malignant cell within 15 minutes, and can be used at a local level to monitor the health of individuals.


The prototype is based on the ability of human cells to make their own electrical signals. The new prototype uses an innovative approach in which a bioelectric sensor is implanted directly into a patient's abdomen. This sensor is made up of a network of small electrodes that are connected to a microcomputer.


Professor Sinclair said: "We now have an accurate, cheap, and robust biosensor designed in the image of a living, breathing entity, and the biosensor can be readily transported to a patient in order to monitor their health."


"This bioelectrical biosensor offers a number of advantages over traditional biological sensors such as COX-2, an enzyme that is often the target of treatment for cancer," explained Professor Sinclair.


The prototype will allow researchers to study the body's response to a specific infection or disease, or monitor the state of the immune system, which has an important impact on the effectiveness of treatment.


A team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Pennsylvania have been working for the past six years to develop the biosensor.


Researchers have identified several applications relating to the use of the sensor. They include monitoring the health of persons with cancer, developing personalized treatments for the immune system and improving the screening of persons with certain types of cancer. The prototype could also be used to monitor the health of patients undergoing medical operations, including those undergoing CTs or MRIs.


Professor Sinclair and his team are expected to present their research at the International Symposium on Biomedical Systems, Biomedicine and Clinical Applications in San Diego on 29-30 January, 2012.

One of the most requested features was to add cross platform play between Mac and Windows. While this is something we're excited about, we have no plans to do this just yet.

This isn't a matter of trying to force a player to switch to Mac and vice-versa, or force an alternative client to be developed. We're currently working on a bunch of exciting features that are still a ways off from release, and cross platform play is not one of them.

The big question most players are asking themselves is what are the advantages to having a cross platform client? What do you gain from having it in place? Is it actually any better than Windows for gaming on OS X?

Before we tackle those questions, let's take a look at the downsides to supporting the alpha release of the game.

First off, it's a good idea to check the Mac forum for an idea of what our current plans for the Mac client may be. As a result of being so early in the development cycle, we haven't had a chance to test and optimize everything. We apologize for the wait and will get ready for a release as soon as we have time to review what our current Mac build is really capable of.

The biggest downside to having a cross platform client is what it implies. Many players don't own a Mac or don't think it should be necessary to have to. If you own a Mac and have the potential to play in a Mac client, then you should! There are a number of reasons to own a Mac. The game is designed to run comfortably on it. It takes up less space in the operating system, and has a nice little feature called AirPlay for downloading your saved games to your iPhone. Being able to play on Windows and OS X together is great!

However, I'm pretty sure that you can't imagine how many people here play on Mac and Windows without them. They're just good friends and the best gaming options available. I'm not going to argue for having a mac client, but to be frank, I also think it would be a little weird if we suddenly made it an exception to the Mac rule of thumb.

Let me know what you think in the comments!

The world's second largest online retailer, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., has, at last, broken out its market research. According to a new report filed with its stock exchange this past week, the company has released an in-depth report on the future of its online and app industry that includes some projections on retail trends. This, after years of speculation, may represent a turning point for Asia's largest e-commerce company.

A key component in the report is the company's goal for 20% of its products to be sold through apps. This would be a big change from the current 2%. The report also predicts that half of China's online shoppers won't even be shopping by smartphone.

The company's online commerce system may become even more dynamic. Alibaba Group will be integrating its mobile app platform Alibaba Cloud with its cloud computing business, Alipay, as well as a range of new services. These include an AI-based algorithm designed to match shoppers to a specific seller, as well as an app design system that will predict how people will search for information and how they will navigate to a specific product.

The company said that it expects to reach a milestone of 20 million merchants by next year, up from 13 million last year.

Alibaba has had some serious setbacks in the last few years that, as recently as this week, will likely have a huge effect on its future. Some of the most serious have been, but are not limited to: the listing of Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a proposed $160 billion initial public offering (IPO) of which it is one of the initial target companies, the recent loss of the CEO, Jack Ma, to a minor illness that seems to have been the result of a serious falling out with his brother, and the sudden departure of the Chinese Commerce Ministry from its stake in the company.<|endoftext|>A/N: I'm a first time reader, so forgive any grammatical and/or spelling errors.

Chapter 1 – The Road to Hogwarts

Harry had never been more sure of anything in his life. The idea of a wizarding school was no more ridiculous than Hogwarts was. Yes, the school had no practical use anymore, but the Hogwarts he remembered as a child, filled with Hogwarts books and Harry's parents' old Quidditch gear, was the Hogwarts he wanted to return to in a flash of speed. He didn't know how he'd ever be able to forget, but that was how he hoped Hermione would be able to forget.

If only he had a way to go back.

A tiny bit of silver slipped across the back of his hand as he ran the cold water over the cloth. He looked at the shiny bead and smiled.

"Mum, how much did I pay that house elf not to kill a few muggles while she was serving me?"

"You can't be serious?"

Snape sat cross-legged in the kitchen chair, reading over the Potions Master's notes in a not-so-gentle manner.

"He couldn't do it," Harry said, shrugging. "He didn't do anything."

"So you mean he wasn't a pure-blood?"

"Pure-blood means pureblooded."

"Harry, you should know: muggles and muggles with magic don't do anything to each other. They use magic if and only if there is a genuine magical power connection that goes back to the blood, and that connection is between the two parties' parents. But as for pure-bloods and muggles with magic, they simply don't. They use magic like they would use a wand, they just don't use it to save lives or make friends, they use it as a means of destroying, murdering, stealing, getting away with murder, and killing. Pure-bloods are just like muggles, not better or worse, just like muggles. No one really gives a damn, actually."

Snape stared hard at him. He still had a few angry slashes across his face where he had been hit by the Dark Lord's curse, but he didn't look nearly as angry as the last time.

The NFL announced their official "score" for Week 4 of the 2013 NFL regular season on Monday. The official score is 49-14 Arizona Cardinals over the San Francisco 49ers. The total of 49 is for Arizona. The official game score, which includes all three periods, is 49-14-13.

It has yet to be determined how the NFL will handle official scores going forward. The league announced in July that the score would remain the same but a new scoring system would be implemented the following season.

"The ship sustained damage while completing combat readiness checks for the Freedom class on Wednesday, Sept. 21, as a result of one or more of the following: a crack in multiple structural members of the hull; a cracked waterline; a cracking bulkhead adjacent to the Command Center; or damage associated with the installation of a catapult, gun launching system, gun control system or shipboard systems not otherwise provided for," the Pentagon reported.

The Navy's 7th Fleet released the information shortly after the Navy's Office of Naval Surface Forces released its own preliminary report, confirming the Freedom suffered extensive damage in a "catastrophic flooding event."

While the Navy did not go so far as to say "catastrophic," the damage to the vessel indicates an actual, catastrophic failure, not just cracking. The Freedom is likely to be stripped of its weapons and sent to drydock for repairs and recertification of systems, the report stated.

"Based on the data available, LCS 8 is currently undergoing repairs to its hull and bow as a part of repairs following a training exercise in which the bow did experience significant damage," the report stated.

The Pentagon noted that the Freedom would need to be recertified before heading to sea in the near future — a fact that doesn't come as a surprise given the severity of the damage. "LCS 8 will receive its own dry dock and a complete overhaul," the Navy stated in regards to the ship's recertification.

The Pentagon report added there were no injuries to personnel. "No one was aboard when damage occurred," the report stated. "No damages to ship or property. No injuries to personnel. An investigation continues."

It looks like the future of the city has arrived: One of the world's top five most expensive hotels, St. Moritz Castle, has been completed.

Dubbed "the most spectacular of all high-end castles" by its developer Herzog, who has the largest family-run real estate firm in Switzerland and is also the owner of the San Siro soccer stadium, the hotel is a five-star hotel and comes at a cost of nearly $20 million.

Built on the mountain, it sits on the slopes of Mount Moritz, which is 6,500 feet above sea level. It takes up more than 50 acres and is surrounded by a lake.

"The hotel will be both very close to the centre of Geneva, and the town will be close to it," said Henri Ries, the head of Herzog and de Meuron, which is behind the hotel.

Mr. Ries says that the city, which he estimated will become the Switzerland's third major city once it gets its own airport, will be a major draw for all visitors since it's a safe city and an excellent location for the ski season.

It is the only ski-resort in Switzerland.

"We have the best ski areas here and the hotels are close to them, so there is great activity to do," Mr. Ries told The Associated Press during the opening of the hotel. "It's good for the country."

The project is not being financed with public money, but with private money from the city.

The Moritz Castle is an example of Herzog's design principles.

He has "never wanted to overbuild something, at least not too much," Mr. Ries said. Herzog's "tactics are much like in architecture; every element has to work together."<|endoftext|>The following is a list of Vaughn Live's stream guidelines Must be at least 18 years of age to have an account and/or stream Streams (example: photos, films, videos, events, live broadcasts) cannot contain content of persons under the age of 18, except professionally pre-produced content.

The New York Times has reportedly confirmed that President Obama's Supreme Court nominee and former Illinois Senator Richard Durbin "tried to help" the New York Federal Reserve Bank obtain a seat on the board of directors of the National Credit Union Administration while serving in the United States Senate.

In fact, it is clear that the Obama administration had little intention of putting a pro-Wall Street bankster on the board of directors of the credit union association. A White House official confirmed to Business Insider that the Obama administration had "no plans" to appoint Durbin to a position at the Federal Reserve. It is also well known that Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, and the Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, both favored banking interests, and did not mind working with Wall Street banks.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank confirmed today to BizTech News that President Obama's choice to be the third member of the Board of Directors of the National Credit Union Administration, William Dudley, had "inadvertently disclosed" to the New York Federal Reserve Bank while serving in the United States Senate that he was "interested in" lobbying for the New York Federal Reserve Bank and other "financial institutions."

It was later learned that Durbin had not been elected to the United States Senate, nor did he appear on the state voting rolls and therefore his nomination was not considered, yet Durbin continued to try to obtain a seat on the Board of Directors.

What is equally noteworthy, however, is that the New York Fed did not even raise an objection to Durbin's attempts to lobby for his old job as a position at the NCUA Board. Instead, it was Durbin's actions that provoked the NY Fed to go to the Federal Reserve and make the complaint to the Federal Reserve that he would take an interest in banking institutions which are not subject to Federal Reserve oversight.

The NY Fed also denied Durbin, by no means the first person to make a similar attempt to get a bank seat on the Fed's Board of Directors, approval to have his confirmation submitted to the Senate, nor to hold positions in the NCUA and at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

According to Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal, "Durbin's efforts to obtain the seat at the NCUA were in their early stages when Warren got involved. Durbin told the Federal Reserve that Dudley, who was then the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, was 'interested in' lobbying at the Federal Reserve for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board."

It is known that when Warren came to Washington her "carefully crafted" "investigations and hearings" were designed to ensure that she had bipartisan support for her legislation and to put pressure on Republicans. Warren sought to secure a chairmanship on the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is an important position as it regulates corporations' stock option policies for senior executives, and that also gives the SEC the tools it needs to investigate companies. And because the position requires a super-majority of votes to confirm a nominee, the job is regarded as a powerful position when it comes to political influence in the financial industry. The White House even considered having her chair the S.E.C.

However, her effort to get the seat on the board at the NCUA was not without opposition. According to Weisenthal, "A coalition of Senate Democrats and unions led by the Communication Workers of America [CEA] and the United Food and Commercial Workers [UFCW] lobbied to keep Dudley off the credit union board, fearing the president's choice would not be an 'objective,' impartial regulator." Warren "lobbied to keep Dudley off of the credit union board," according to the Times.

Moreover, another group that wanted a board seat for Dudley was the Financial Services Roundtable, where former members of the Clinton Administration that advocated for Wall Street banks, like former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, former Commodities Future Trading Commission Chairman, Gary Gensler, former Chair to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and former Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, Lawrence Summers, were the members.

In an effort to put pressure on these opponents of Dudley's board appointment, Weisenthal said that, after the Senate Banking Committee was informed that Warren was going to pursue Dudley's appointment "at least a handful of the committee's Republicans joined it" in voting to confirm the nominee. Even the chair of the Federal Reserve, the influential Daniel Tarullo, who supported Dudley and was "one of [her] strongest supporters," voted "present" and voted "no" according to Weisenthal.

In other words, Senate Republicans were willing to let Warren "do the work" and vote the seat away from a former Treasury Secretary, another White House appointee, and another pro-Wall Street bank nominee. As stated in the Senate Banking Committee's report on Dudley's appointment, the Obama administration went a more extreme route to remove the

The dog-bite fatality of this past August in Florida has now been ruled a homicide by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office. The dog's owner has not been accused of any crime.


The incident occurred at 8:00 p.m. on Aug. 8, 2015 when the owner was leaving his house after returning to his job at a medical facility. As the owner approached his driveway, his dog — a 2-year-old boxer named Bailey — began sniffing him and then bit him on the side of the face several times. The bite was stopped when he pulled up, got on the phone with the dog's owner, and instructed the owner to take his dog to his vet for treatment. Two hours to drive to his car — and two hours to travel back — later, the owner arrived to find this news report :


"Bailey's body was unrecognizable...his ears were gone....his nose and lips were ripped...his jaw was fractured...his spinal cord was severed."


Two hours later, the owner returned to the emergency room of Dr. Robert C. Crain and found that the dog was still in critical condition. A week later, the dog died — this time, in surgery, in the emergency room of the Palm Beach County Veterinary Medical Center.


Crain wrote in an autopsy report that Bailey suffered internal damage, including multiple puncture wounds, to one eye, in a "stabbing manner."


According to his family friend, Bailey died as a result of the dog's bite. The medical examiner's office ruled Bailey's death a homicide.

======================================== SAMPLE 351 ========================================
DUBLIN – At the height of the crisis, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams took his young children to the United States on a trip that has become the subject of intense scrutiny as the former British colony struggles to emerge from its longest period of political isolation.

The U.S. trip came just one week after the announcement that the Irish government would no longer make financial aid available to the people of Northern Ireland in the absence of progress toward an agreement following five weeks of political stalemate that has led to an economic collapse.

And that was the main focus of the Adams family's trip, which began with an overnight hotel stay at the Hotel LaSalle, a downtown Dublin hotel that was a favorite of the Adamses during their first visit to Ireland in 1981.

Adams, his eldest daughter, Mary, 14, and her younger brother, Michael, 13, left for New York shortly after midnight on September 1 and did not return until around noon the following day.

"It's a wonderful experience," Mary Adams told Fox News on Sunday from New York.

PHOTOS: Gerry Adams' Family Album

Asked if the trip was all about the children, Mary Adams shook her head and replied, "We've also been on a number of trips where that's been one of the main things that came up."

"We've traveled a lot, and we've come back and been with our family on most of the trips."

In an article written for the BBC earlier this month that was based on interviews conducted by the Irish broadcaster, it was noted that the Adams children often traveled with their parents on trips to visit Irish friends or family in Ireland, but that a trip such as this would be the first time their father and mother were traveling together "in a serious and permanent capacity."

Adams, who retired from serving as an IRA commander after leaving office in 2007, took his children to the United States with a number of other senior Sinn Féin figures following the collapse of the peace process earlier this year.

During his interview with Fox News, which will air on Monday, former IRA chief Gerry Adams noted while it was a positive trip for the children, he wished they traveled by train rather than the plane when going home from New York.

"It just so happened I was there with four of my colleagues, we'd left Dublin two hours before my kids went in a van the other side of town," he said.

"I wasn't at home, but I was watching all of their activity, watching what a great experience it was for them and me, to see them in the United States. I would have wished them to go to train by car, and, if they could do that on their own, I think it would be much easier and much safer for their families and for themselves. I wouldn't have wanted them to travel on the subway at night, because there were a lot of problems that took place on that train, not at night, but in the early hours, particularly if you're trying to get home."

Adams' statement echoes those made by ex-member of the IRA, Denis Donaldson, who told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show on Sunday that the children should have traveled by train and not the bus, as well as by the water, because of the dangers they would have encountered if taken by car or airplane.

Adams' comments on Monday echoed those made by Donaldson on the programme, as he also insisted that the children should not have travelled out of the country, but that he would have taken them on his own "in a serious and permanent capacity."

"You could see they were really excited and they had a great time in New York, but they wouldn't have gone to Ireland because they still had a lot of work to do and a big political question to get through, which they weren't the right kind of people to be going through," said Donaldson, who currently lives in the United States.

Donaldson claimed the children were in fact "too young" for the trip, but denied that the trip was about the children.

A spokesperson for Sinn Féin last month confirmed that the Sinn Fein president's children were on the trip, noting that Adams had a busy schedule of meetings this week after the fall of the political impasse led him to announce in front of a packed room at the European Parliament that the political impasse between the two sides of Northern Ireland was over.

A spokesperson told Fox News, "It was made clear that the trip would provide an opportunity for Gerry and [political advisors Gerry Carroll, Gerry Kelly and Gerry Adams] to explore the possibility of the children continuing their education as they went to visit their family. This was in line with the Sinn Féin policy as set out in the Sinn Féin manifesto as reported in the newspaper this weekend."
======================================== SAMPLE 352 ========================================
In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, which was obtained by Politico and which was signed by three dozen more former Justice Department officials, former attorneys general Alberto Gonzales, John Ashcroft, Dick Thornburgh and Richard Thornburgh argued there are serious questions surrounding the administration of ObamaCare and the legality of President Obama's actions in signing it into law.

In their letter, sent on July 15, 2013, the former Justice officials outlined their concern, saying, "We are writing to emphasize that all federal employees are potentially covered under federal insurance exchanges established by ObamaCare. As the Administration's own regulations indicate, if any new federal employees receive health care on an Exchange administered by the Administration, they are also potentially covered, notwithstanding any individual mandate provision in the law."

While there were numerous issues raised by the federal officials, the most important claim by the former Justice Department officials was that the administration's actions in signing ObamaCare were illegal and that there was a need for them to send a "letter of explanation" to the attorney general because of the legal "seriousness of the underlying legal issues."

The letter further states that, "Although the Administration provided a two-page explanation to the Congress of what it claimed was the legal basis for the individual mandate on March 31, 2013, it offered no additional information on other aspects of the statute or on ObamaCare itself, the underlying legal issues that may underlie these actions or the steps the Administration is taking, including proposed changes to the rules and regulations governing federal workplace health care exchanges."

The letter went on to state, "In our view, if federal employees receive health insurance on an exchange administered by the Administration that is the same as or substantially similar to coverage granted by the employer to which they were previously responsible, they may be subject not only to the mandate but to additional reporting requirements, penalties and the imposition of tax penalties not covered by the mandate."

"We are concerned that the Administration is making decisions not in keeping with the law. While federal employees receive insurance through their employer and pay both employer-provided and themselves-provided premiums, the Administration is making decisions that impact their health benefit coverage for the first time," the letter states.

The letter went on to state that former Attorney General Gonzales, who served as Attorney General of the United States from 1999-2005, served as acting attorney general when Lynch was confirmed as the next Attorney General by the Senate last week.

While Lynch has indicated she agrees that ObamaCare is illegal, and in a press conference she said, "Well, I believe that the law is the law, and so, with the respect to that, if there are questions that the Department has at all, I'd like to take the opportunity to seek more information before I make a determination about how we can move forward on this particular issue."

However, Politico points out that Attorney General Lynch has not offered any explanation. In fact, in her letter to Lynch, the former Justice officials are asking her to "declare that the individual mandate is unlawful and that any person who receives health care coverage through an Exchange created by the legislation is subject to the law."

In a letter to President Obama, the former former DOJ officials wrote that the Obama administration's actions under ObamaCare are "fraught with legal questions" and that the administration needs to "take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that all federal employees, regardless of their title, receive adequate health insurance coverage."

Additionally, the three former Justice officials questioned if the Administration is "properly interpreting or enforcing" the law, stating, "Congress, which is responsible for implementing the employer mandate, has provided only the broadest definition of 'substantially similar coverage' under the law, and the administration has largely left such interpretations to the EEOC and the courts in implementing the employer mandate.

"In doing so, the administration is subjecting millions of employees to a form of double standards. In essence, the employer mandate requires some employees to purchase coverage from the employer, but does not require others to do so. Moreover, while the administration continues to assert that 'unlike' plans will be exempted from the employer mandate, the administrative record shows that the administrative definition was not consistently followed, and there is some evidence that it might not be.

"Our conclusion that individuals in federal civilian agencies are covered under an Exchange administered by the Administration is based upon their statutory definition of 'the same plan,' including the definition contained in 42(a)(1), as well as statutory language from 28 CFR Sec. 2940.13(c)."

The former Justice officials also said they "have serious doubts" about how the administration will treat state-based exchanges under the same rules as those operating in the federal exchanges.

A man who was detained last month at a North Dakota airport has been cleared to be reunited with his parents.

The Bismarck Tribune reports that a Bismarck judge on Thursday dismissed allegations and a warrant against 37-year-old William Michael Harris, who had been detained for hours on Oct. 23 at the Fargo-Moorhead border crossing.

SPONSORED

A magistrate's court judge ruled that the government had failed to prove that the man posed a significant threat to flight security or public safety, and he declined to issue the search warrant against Harris on that basis.

Harris was traveling back to his hometown of Bismarck, North Dakota, after a trip to California where he helped organize a protest against fracking. Border Security Agent Joseph Wills, who is also charged with misdemeanor indecent exposure, made the initial detainment at the Fargo-Moorhead checkpoint despite Harris' repeated protests that he was a U.S. citizen and was on his way to his parents' funeral in North Dakota.

Harris, who is being represented by attorneys Michael Boldin and Jennifer Young, told court Judge Bruce McMonagle that it was unfair for the agents to take him into custody because he had "done nothing" to warrant the stop on his return to his hometown.

Harris told the court that as he was being forced to wait on the ground for several hours, agents removed his glasses, placed his hands behind his back and handcuffed him behind his back.

The Associated Press reported that authorities reported finding marijuana in Harris' checked baggage.

At one point during his detention, agents allegedly attempted to administer medical tests to Harris but he objected in protest.

Judge McMonagle ruled that Harris' rights were violated and that he was detained based on a "fishing expedition" that "frightened, intimidated and humiliated" Harris.

A spokesperson for U.S. Border Patrol said the agency will comply immediately with decisions from all district attorneys where Harris' case is headed and said they were not surprised by the court's decision.

"Bismarck is a busy crossing, and there are many people who live outside of that county," he said. "So there's likely no more than six or seven folks a month who would be detained at this checkpoint with Mr. Harris."

— Gwen

Gwen Tennyson is a main character from the Animal Crossing series, first appearing in Doubutsu no Mori e+ and Doubutsu no Mori (New Leaf). Her name likely alludes to her love for animals, as well.

Characteristics [ edit ]

Appearance [ edit ]

The character has the same green eyes as the player (and their town). Her eyebrows are pink, the tips of her eyes are orange and she has red eyeliner and pink lipstick, which are all different for every game (except for her first appearance, where the colors are the same as in Doubutsu no Mori e+ and Animal Forest e+, which were the same). It also has brown eyebrows for some seasons, but other seasons have her dark eyebrows. She has pink hair, which is very long in New Leaf and Doubutsu no Mori e+ as seen in the "Piggy Piggy" hairstyle and has long pink lashes for Spring.

Personality [ edit ]

Below is a brief description of the snooty personality. For more information, click here.

As a snooty villager, Gwen will initially appear rude and snobby, but after talking to her, she will reveal that she has a softer side, to the point where the lazy and peppy villagers may start to dislike her. She will find a home with other lazy, peppy, and snooty villagers, who may include herself. She may also get along with jock villagers, who enjoy joking about the same subjects as her and her male counterpart.

A top police chief has warned of a terrorist attack planned on London in the lead up to the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations.

Chief Constable Andy Marsh, the head of the Metropolitan Police Service, told a House of Commons select committee: "There has been some planning since April about terrorist action being carried out in London and there are people with a definite intention to do so."

"It is likely they will not succeed," he said.

A number of terror plots have been foiled since the Manchester Arena bomb earlier this week.

He had previously warned of a "potential attack" on Buckingham Palace and other high-profile events in London.

Asked by MPs why police forces had not prevented any of the plots, he said that although they "pursue every aspect of the threat", they have to prioritise where there is less threat.

It was the second time Mr Marsh had warned of a terrorist attack on the British capital, after warning in December about the threat level to the capital being raised.<|endoftext|>Image copyright PA Image caption The government has announced plans for a review of how it spends the UK's foreign aid budget.

The Department for International Development has said it will publish proposals to set out the way the country's £12bn aid budget will be spent to ensure it is spent effectively.

The government previously said it would review how £120m of UK aid was used by the Department for International Development (DfID) in 2012.

The decision is designed to "enhance transparency" and "protect the public good".

This followed concerns expressed by MPs following disclosures of internal memos that accused the DfID of failing to properly use funds.

In a letter to MPs, DfID Secretary Justine Greening said the review would give "clear guidance on the best uses of every penny of British aid".

The plan includes:

Publishing a timetable for the introduction of a framework contract for aid contracts;

Setting out how new and existing aid will be spent on key projects across the UK;

Investigating the effectiveness of the spending review to "identify areas and improvements in public spending where the public interest is better served by improvements to contract processes" and "identifying areas where funding could be better used to boost projects at a greater scale (more than £500,000) and/or in a broader public interest".

The review will be implemented at the end of the financial year, she said.

The Department for International Development is expected to publish its proposed draft framework contract and a draft of the evaluation report later in the spring.

'Better use'

DfID has been under pressure to tighten spending rules after it emerged it had spent tens of millions of pounds on a controversial trip to Kazakhstan for the Kazakh president in 2009.

The Foreign Office said it was "in agreement" with the government on the need for "better use" of funds.

Ms Greening told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that the proposed framework contract for all aid spending and an interim report published ahead of this month's Spending Review "will give clear guidance on the best uses of every penny of British aid".

Image copyright Met Police Image caption An F-35B Lightning II planes was destroyed in a fire at the Ministry of Defence's Oruzgan Military Airport, Urganj

On the government's review proposals, she told MPs: "I was happy to publish the draft of the framework contract this spring.

"What I have not released is the final version."

She added that while there was plenty of information "at the moment there is more to do", the government did not "want to rush a final outcome".

'Better use'

The government has also published an annual report on aid, which charts the government's spending in Britain or abroad since 1 January 2009.

On 3 February, the shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, accused the government of "caving in" to demands for more action following a speech from the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.

Mr Johnson blamed the delay in publishing the foreign aid review report on the "complex" nature of the issues, which included issues relating to the EU.

On Wednesday, the UK was named as one of a number of countries "effectively" using public money for terrorism-related purposes by a parliamentary committee. According to the committee, Britain has given $150m (£95m) to Saudi-backed groups battling Shia rebels in Yemen.

The foreign secretary said at the time that "wherever possible" aid must be used by the government to counter terrorism.<|endoftext|>In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, France's government is proposing an additional 4 billion euros in security measures.

The latest report on gender-based violence released Wednesday by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime describes more than 8,000 cases of sexual violence against women, including 3,859 rapes in the past year — an increase of almost 50 percent over the last five years.

And while Nigeria's economy grows at an annual average of 4.1 percent, more than 10 million people are malnourished — about one in four.

As a consequence, girls in Nigeria, the U.N. says, are at a great physical and economic disadvantage compared to women in countries such as Brazil.

"In developing and transitioning countries, the situation poses very real challenges for women and girls, who need strong commitments from the government to protect them against violence and to make economic and social investments in women and girls," said Carmina Arduengo, a UNICEF senior analyst.

"This report is another warning signal that girls and women are already being put into danger — one that demands urgent action."

One of the worst countries to be a woman or girl is North Korea, with 880 recorded cases of violence against women, the highest number of any country.

On the other end of the spectrum is Burkina Faso, where an estimated 4,200 women and girls lost their lives from 2010 to 2015 due to violence.

In the middle is the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at 1,050 deaths of women and girls, followed by Mali, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda and Togo — which all suffer from violence against women.

The highest number of women and girls who suffer violent death has been recorded in Niger, with 5,000 cases — the highest in the world.<|endoftext|>The United States of America is a world superpower of the 21st century and the third largest producer of oil in the world.

At his day job as an analyst in F1, he breaks down the intricacies of the sport. He sits down with Motorsport.com's Andrew Benson for a chat about what's next for F1…

Andrew Benson: I hope you don't mind me asking because we've just been to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Sebastian Vettel: Yeah of course – and you can hear in the background everything. The sounds. It's so loud and so exciting for someone like me. I'm not going to complain about it.

AB: You must go into the race with a lot of stress, knowing what you can and can't do. You had a pretty dominant weekend, coming back from the slowest race of 2015 to win again at a track where there is not a lot of overtaking. Are you getting nervous about where you sit amongst the drivers?

SB: Of course I am nervous, that's part of driving F1. If you lose the first few laps it is completely different when you're starting from third place. It is a completely different feel of the car. There's a lot of confidence that you have, of your own car.

You know where you are, where the car's at – and obviously there's still a lot of track time and we've got some tough track days ahead of us, but you have a feeling that you just have to do a little bit better…

In the third and fourth stint, if everybody was equal I would say Sebastian should probably be sitting in the podium, he deserved it more but it's still not there at all, but in the past it has been there in the middle of the race. It's great for the championship because it's obviously very close to the end. They

By JULIE JORDANS, AP National Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's eldest son has told congressional investigators who interviewed him that he did not disclose his June 2016 meeting last summer with a Russian lawyer, as previously reported by The Associated Press.

Jared Kushner's interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee came as a New York Times report suggested that he arranged the meeting so that his father-in-law could be shown compromising information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

The Times story said that after the meeting, Kushner said he was trying to establish a back-channel line of communication with Moscow. The newspaper said it obtained an email written by Kushner and seen by the Times which did not mention his participation in the meeting nor the Russian lawyer.

"It has been incorrectly reported that I attended a meeting during the campaign with a Russian attorney and a Russian lobbyist," Kushner told House investigators from the Senate panel that has been investigating Russian meddling in the U.S. election and possible contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials. It is unclear whether Kushner gave a full account of what the meeting was about.

The Times said that during the meeting, the lawyer told Kushner that incriminating information about Hillary Clinton was part of a Russian government effort to help the Republican candidate. The report said that although Kushner didn't initially mention the meeting to senior members of the campaign, he did mention it to Russian officials a few weeks later during a meeting at Trump Tower.

Kushner's lawyers did not immediately return AP's request for comment on Kushner's meeting with investigators. It was not immediately clear if Kushner had volunteered information to congressional investigators or was being forced to speak out in advance of his testimony.

The White House said Friday that Kushner had volunteered to participate in the June 8 meeting without any knowledge that it was to discuss a Russian effort to aid the campaign of Trump's Democratic opponent — as Trump Jr. had described.

Kushner, who is married to Trump's wife, said Thursday that he had no recollection of the meeting. Trump Jr., who tweeted a photo of himself sitting in on the meeting, has since confirmed the existence of the meeting. In that tweet, Trump Jr. says he "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up."

Kushner acknowledged to the Senate panel that his "primary recollection" from the meeting was that it focused on Russian adoptions. In a statement, he said: "As part of the discussion, I volunteered that I would be available to share with the committee my emails and other information regarding the meeting."

The statement said that he had not told his father-in-law about the meeting "until this week," citing "concern that this disclosure could pose a conflict of interest." The Senate Intelligence Committee released the statement early Friday evening.

Trump's son-in-law is the most senior White House official to be questioned by investigators probing Moscow's interference in the American election and any connections to the Trump campaign. His testimony is expected to take place sometime next week.

It emerged last week that Trump Jr. agreed to meet with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, as well as a representative for the Russian leader, before he took office; his initial version of events that day was that the meeting focused on damaging information about Clinton. Investigators have said that the president was not aware of emails sent earlier in the year about the possible meeting.

Last week, Trump's son-in-law said that he had "no memory" of the meeting, though CNN has reported that he shared information obtained in the meeting about the Democratic National Committee's finances as part of a Russian investigation.

He has also said he "had no recollection" of receiving an email about meeting with an attorney for Natalia Veselnitskaya, who he was told had information helpful to the campaign. That statement conflicts with statements he made to the Senate panel, and with information he gave to the House Intelligence Committee.

On Friday, Kushner said he had sought to learn about the meeting's attendees by consulting with top campaign staffers and his legal team, as well as "people I know in Russia." He called this effort a "good use of my time" when asked if he had discussed the meeting with anyone else on his campaign staff.

Just when it seems like we're finally beginning to end America's brutal wars, another new high-profile war, this one being a "counterinsurgency" effort in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, comes bubbling up (if not bubbling up quite so loudly as when it once did). It's been going on for years, and now, with this latest, perhaps most unusual, American adventure, it's finally coming to a head.

Just three months after a U.S. drone strike killed one of the men seen as Ayman al-Zawahiri's likely successor, Ayman Mohsen al-Masri, in Yemen, the Pentagon announced that it and other Central Command (CENTCOM), the unit charged with fighting American troops abroad, had dispatched what it called an expeditionary ground force to Saudi Arabia. Not so fast. The White House issued one statement later noting that "this is not an expeditionary force and does not represent an expansion of President Obama's previous authorization in 2011, which was a six-month commitment of approximately 50 U.S. military personnel." That's still enough of a hint of denial that one might be forgiven for thinking that these troops were on vacation.

The announcement comes on the heels of the arrival of yet another contingent of Pentagon advisers to "train" the Saudi military in the fight against its neighbors. And there are more: Already there are "advisers" from the State Department, as well as from the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA, among others. And as the Pentagon puts it, these are just "informal" advisers, but these aren't like the advisers that "advise and assist" U.S. troops in the field.

And let's forget about the fact that, for the last two decades, we have been doing precisely the opposite of "advis[ing]" our Saudi Arabian allies since our invasion began in 1990. While it's true that Saudi Arabia has been a U.S. ally in the Iran-Iraq War that started in 1980, and that it's been paying off a massive military subsidy to the United States, it's also true that, at this point, the United States and the Saudi kingdom have much more in common than either is willing to admit. In recent years, our two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been waged, directly or indirectly, with money and assistance from Saudi Arabia's treasury. If you want to know how Saudi Arabia is using its enormous oil revenues to finance its military adventures in Yemen (and in Syria; see TomDispatch's latest dispatches from Syria), just skip ahead to chapter 11 of this series, "The Saudi Connection," for a peek at the evidence.

At this late hour, before the latest crisis, the White House seems less than enthusiastic about adding to that evidence. After all, the U.S. already has several thousand troops in the kingdom. In January, it put "more than 50 advisors on the ground" in support of the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. This summer it sent Special Operations forces to Yemen and sent an "adviser," the same person, to help train the Saudis, the White House said. In fact, that Pentagon person, Captain James Steele, was actually in the country to give Saudi Arabia an armored-vehicle demonstration to mark its "National Tank Day."

Now here's the funny thing: The "advisers" and "trainees" just announced to the world are not, in fact, really advisers but special operations forces. These are special operations forces, of course, who have their own special headquarters in Riyadh (a Special Operations Command unit). This week, in fact, they also began "sustaining" a counterterrorism unit in Yemen, also known as "the Joint Special Operations Response Group," and which, among other things, has been engaged with U.S. drones and other special operations forces in the country. (When I wrote about this last year, I noted that, for all the apparent coolness of the special operations forces at large, the command they were working with is itself rather cool -- though that was before they were also working with the Pentagon-owned "Maritime Prepositioning Group 14").

This all may sound like a big diversion and a lot of paperwork -- but in truth, in the United States, this sort of thing takes place all the time. It's called "embedding." In fact, in the decade or so leading up to this latest intervention, the Pentagon has been embedding Special Operations forces and other special ops soldiers all over the Middle East, a far more effective strategy for accomplishing, in the words of the Bush administration, an "intensified campaign against Al Qaeda and its affiliates" --

Plot

Spoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.

The title screen displays two pictures, one from A and one from B.

This first section shows the characters from A and then the ones from B.

In A, Ash and his friends meet two people who live in the house where Ash and his friends lived when they decided to leave Kanto and start their journey. Ash and his friends also meet a girl named Misty who will be joining Team Rocket in their new plan of getting rich with Pokémon.

In B, the two people from whom Ash and his friends initially met, Professor Oak and his assistant May, are back in Kanto and living together again. After becoming friends through their shared love of Pokémon, Oak takes Ash on a field trip to the forest where his research is done. It is a wild and dangerous place, and Ash's team is caught as prey by a huge Treecko. After an encounter with some of the Pokémon in the forest, Ash and his friends rescue several of them by defeating Team Rocket.

The game starts with a scene showing Ash's friends discussing the events of the last few episodes.

Gameplay

Like its Generation III counterpart, this game uses the Pokédex. In battle, the game displays its opponent's stats through icons. Like most Pokémon games, it also allows for three different attacks during a battle, but unlike previous games, it displays the attack with which the opponent is most vulnerable: a small icon showing the move. However, unlike past games, this game allows for more Pokémon in a battle (12 on the game's first screen and 16 on later screens) and gives the player a choice of how many moves he or she can use during a battle.

Although it is named Pokémon Adventures, it is not an adventure, but rather a simulation of a real traveling Pokémon League. Most of the game is filled with battles between Trainers to earn points, mainly to earn badges (most of which also give you better things to do in the game, like visiting other cities). It has many different cities and other areas to visit, but it is recommended players are familiar with this game's structure, as it is one of the most difficult games in the series.

Items

In the beginning, players pick a Pokémon from the starting seven as their starter. The player also gets a Pokémon holding the Heart Scale. The first three Pokémon in the starter family can evolve into a Pokémon with a name that follows that of its parent. After this, there are two more paths the player can go down. This leads to either one of three main Pokémon, Pokémon #35 (a Snivy), #40 (a Tepig) and #45 (a Oshawott). One of the most important factors to notice is that these Pokémon grow along with the player, instead of being added with every update.

A Poké Ball can be used to catch wild Pokémon, but only if the player is in the first slot of the party. Each party member can only hold one Pokémon at a time.

In the middle is a Poké Doll, which can make a Poké Ball into a Poké Ball 2 and give the player an item. Using it will require the player to take the Poké Ball for 10 Poké Balls to get a Rare Candy. However, it will only be available for the first day of the game; if it is not, the game will give a hint.

The bottom line

The bottom line of the screen shows the status of the player's Pokémon, Pokémon Eggs, Poké Doms and other items.

LONDON (Reuters) - European investors could be forced to cut their exposure to Britain's fabled but illiquid pound due to fears the euro zone economy was set to slow, according to two senior banking executives.

Rights and shares of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc are shown at its headquarters in Edinburgh, Scotland February 5, 2008. REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton

A sharp slowdown in Britain's economy and the rise of anti-European parties like France's National Front and Italy's Five Star Movement has intensified fears about the health of the broader euro zone.

The comments by London-based executives at the European firms and banks that control the pound could complicate a campaign ahead of a May 22 referendum by the British electorate to stay in the EU and secure the financial services' sector's biggest share of the bloc's $25-trillion economy.

"With the vote on (a British exit) coming up (on May 22), there is an increasing likelihood that the pound will be weaker and the cost of hedging will go up, increasing the risk exposure of banks and corporations and possibly investors alike," said one of the bankers.

"A significant proportion of the pound-denominated assets of our clients and institutions are in the form of euros, so for a lot (of them), hedging in euros and holding dollars, would make sense."

The source, who declined to be named, told Reuters that some banks and companies might choose to avoid the euro zone altogether for business reasons, for which they would need to find alternatives, such as London.

"The euro area will continue, of course, to have a strong, positive role to play," said the trader, who is based in the euro zone and declined to be named.

He said that when hedging euros against the pound has led to losses, "the hedgers will ask why, and the reason is ... the euro area is going to weaken, and that means it will be less attractive ... it'll be harder to take profit."

An economic slowdown in a currency bloc, such as the euro zone itself, is an immediate concern for financial markets.

And while the euro zone remains a major economy, it has been sluggish for years, and the risks of a sudden fall in demand for euros would probably be greater for banks that hold more euros against the pound.

"The euro area has always been slow in the first place, and there's been no reason why it shouldn't be more slow now," said the source.

"We should see a faster growth of the euro area over the next few years, and if we see a bit of a slowing in the growth in the euro area, that could be a reason to be more critical of the euro zone," he added.

The euro slid 0.4 percent at $1.0640 on the foreign exchange market as of 1133 GMT (3:33 a.m. EDT), underperforming the broader FTSEurofirst 300 index, and hitting its highest in almost three weeks. The single currency's weaker performance came on the back of a 1.8 percent fall in the euro against the U.S. penny to $0.8788.

POTENTIAL FOR A MOSTLY CRITICAL RESET

A recent fall in the euro helped the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rise 2.9 percent in 2014, but many expect a more significant rebound this year due to weak growth in the euro zone.

The pound is worth almost as much as $1.29 after a sharp drop that occurred in 2008, when then U.S. President Barack Obama tried to prevent a U.S. bailout of the banks that caused the crash and a collapse of global financial markets and the global economy.

But even the euro's weakness is not likely to be a game-changer for European markets, which are now expecting a sharp slowdown in growth. The euro's decline of 1.0 percent against the dollar and 0.6 percent against the yen on Tuesday put it on course to end 2014 on a two-year downtrend, despite the Bank of England's efforts to support it.

There are concerns among analysts over the euro zone's ability to sustain recovery even though it could not, or would not, agree to bail out its banks. Germany said in May it was willing to provide an emergency backstop to the continent's southern banks.

The sources said British investors' holdings of euro-denominated assets could also be at risk as fears over the euro continue to grow.

"A number of these (bank) customers have very large hedging programmes, so a very, very substantial loss would be possible at some stage in the future," said one of the experts, who also declined to be named.

"So the question becomes how do you hedge against that?" he added.

"If you're an institution like Barclays

The last two seasons have seen a huge improvement in the defensive line from the Dallas Cowboys last year after years of not even being able to stay out of the top ten of the "Fumble Plus" table.

It is important to point out that this has been a top ten group for a long time now, and in some seasons they will finish in the top ten even after not having much improvement compared to what we now see. This is not an anomaly.

This season, the defense has gone from 30th overall to 9th overall in the final five weeks after having slipped to 14th in the last two weeks following the Eagles game on Sunday afternoon.

The final five weeks, in particular, have seen a lot positive improvement on the defensive line, with the line going from 19th overall the week before to 9th overall through the weekend, which is something that was previously considered a top ten unit.

They did so by giving up the fewest total yards and third-fewest rushing yards through the weekend, both of which show a lot of improvement by the defense.

It's a credit to the defensive line, which are continuing to put in more consistent effort, and also Dallas secondary. This is a unit that has shown its strengths and weaknesses all along, but after last year's disappointing season finale against the Giants, they did a great job of capitalizing on those weaknesses last year in Week 14 when the offense was playing from behind, including being able to force turnovers and limiting the yards that the Giants could throw.

While it is true that this group got more help from the secondary at the end of last season compared to at the beginning, Dallas did get better overall from the front four through the season. This has continued this season too, with the front four having given up the second-fewest yards before contact in the league this season after giving up the least yards through the regular season.

Overall, it has been a good season for the defensive line and it will be no surprise when the defensive line finishes with a strong finish to season as they have done the last two seasons.<|endoftext|>The latest trailer for "Penguins of Madagascar" has released to promote the upcoming film, which will hit theaters on March 18, 2016.

Banks have been on the back foot as investors are seeking an escape from the EU, with the share price plummeting amid fears that Britain could crash out of the EU without a deal.

The FTSE 100 bank index reached a seven-year low, hitting its lowest level since early 2012, and the biggest fall was on London lenders, as the fallout from the Brexit triggered a plunge in the value of shares in the City.

"Financial institutions are very concerned that the UK does not strike a deal that is satisfactory to the City. The fear is that the City will be the only part of the UK that will leave the EU, so the negative sentiment surrounding the City is just making those fears worse," says Tom Keeney, a portfolio manager at Fathom Financial Advisory.

Many investors are also worried that the UK will impose a financial transactions tax on all financial transactions - the so-called Tobin tax - with its capital controls, which would also take away the appeal of European banking hubs.

The European Central Bank is also concerned that the UK may go ahead with its plans to impose EU-wide rules on the level of bankers' bonuses, which is seen as an attempt to weaken the City.

In contrast, the US Federal Reserve is not overly worried about the prospect of Brexit. It recently made clear in the annual report it is prepared to hike interest rates as needed to boost American growth.

The Federal Reserve is in charge of the US economy and it is prepared to do exactly what it says it wants," a Fed spokesperson said.

The UK vote to leave the EU has created a deep division within the City, which is based on its financial hub that is in Europe as well as the UK.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has been making big news recently regarding the war on drugs. On December 9, it sued one of the largest distributors of illegal drugs in US history, Pharma Brokerage Services (PBSA), alleging that they were illegally funneling drugs to Mexican drug cartels. The DOJ is hoping that if they can stop them from doing this, then so will the cartels.

What's the big deal?

Over half of the heroin and cocaine imported into the US today comes from Mexico. The Mexican government has admitted they are fighting the cartels, who smuggle drugs on their territory and then ship the drugs north to get sold to the American public. And while some of the drugs do make it through the US and are then sold to law enforcement and other drug addicts, many cartels simply use the drugs to ship cocaine west in a way they've only ever done before, as they've never been forced to deal with border controls.

There's now no reason for the cartels to have to deal with border controls or stop transporting their drugs north into the US. And the US is getting involved in helping keep heroin out of the country.

The problem is that the DOJ has not found a single person guilty of a crime involved in this, and they still don't understand much about how the heroin actually gets to the United States. The US is now involved in an investigation of drug trade routes between Colombia and the United States, which are apparently being controlled by the Medelline Cartel. And what about Mexico? The DEA is involved with drug cartels to the borders of Mexico, but still doesn't have an understanding of how the drugs are being smuggled to and from the country.

Why not just stop the distribution?

So far, this is what the DOJ has had to do. In early 2012, they filed a lawsuit against PBSA, in hopes of stopping it from exporting cocaine and heroin to the US, and then importing them again. They wanted to prevent PBSA from sending drugs from Colombia into the US.

They won.

A US federal district court judge upheld the US government's case against PBSA, and then the district court ordered PBSA to pay a $1.5 million fine. But the department of justice hasn't won the war on drugs. The judge didn't give PBSA any legal recourse. In the end, the judge declared PBSA and its owners guilty of aiding and abetting the smuggling of illegal drugs.

PBSA and its owners have no actual responsibility. The court basically ruled that they didn't "consplain" or "admit" anything when they were questioned, and therefore they were guilty of aiding and abetting. It was a very clear conclusion that the DOJ thought they had in mind with their lawsuit. It's why PBSA owner Charles Babcock was forced to file a motion to dismiss the case.

Now they want to fight it in federal court?

But the government wants a second crack at the case. They have also filed a motion to reopen the lawsuit, citing that as long as PBSA is involved, then drugs will definitely be going north. That's absurd, considering that, just days ago, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) came out against another pharmaceutical company, AmerisourceBergen , for doing exactly that.

AmerisourceBergen is one of the largest distributors in the country and claims to deliver drugs to the US only through the Port of Oakland. The US government didn't think that would solve anything, claiming that it would still enable the drugs to be smuggled into the country to sell to Americans.

And now the case is set to move again.

So the DOJ has now asked the court that they be able to "reopen" the case for PBSA, who has been fighting the US government to prove that they didn't violate the DEA's actions.

And in a filing that they submitted in June, the US government argued that "the fact that the district court did not accept the government's interpretation of PBSA's alleged role as a conduit for illegally imported drugs is irrelevant."

"We are deeply disappointed that Congress chose to change the original scope of the statute without even informing the public of its intent and without even a brief discussion on the Senate floor," Attorney General Eric Holder wrote in the filing.

The DOJ argues that the case should be reopened because PBSA claims it is the "sole supplier" of drugs to Mexico and that if they were to stop dealing with the cartels, then drugs would go to the US, where they can be sold to Americans.

"The court has made clear that we will not rest until we have obtained justice for all who have been harmed, and for the victims whose loved ones have been brutally killed," Holder wrote.

Now the DOJ wants to fight it again. They've submitted another filing on December 7th asking for the judge to reopen the case for PBSA and to take the case to

I am an old English guy, so the term "whip" is quite familiar to me. It comes into my vocabulary quite regularly: it's a slang term in British English for towing. In my native country England, you'd sometimes see it used in different slang terms, even in the local vocabulary.

For example, the term "whip" is now quite ubiquitous in the English-speaking world nowadays. That being said, I do not use this term very often as I tend to be more familiar with the more modern terminology.

Let's talk about "whipping".

The origin of "whipping"

"Whip" is a noun that has a slightly different pronunciation in British English than it does in American English. In British English, a "whipping" is any method or action that is applied to an unwilling victim that is known to be a weak or helpless person (i.e. a slave).

In contrast, some Americans prefer to think of "whipping" as an "inhuman" and "dereliction" (i.e. degrading) form of punishment, which is something that was done only a few months ago or decades ago but nobody wants to talk about it. There are people who actually use "whipping" as an actual word for the act as a derogatory term. I'm not making any sense but I believe that there are people who still want to consider the terms "whipping" and "whip" as equivalent. They use the word "whippet" in their own ways but there is nothing that resembles "whipping a slave"…<|endoftext|>About This Game

One of the great things about the free plans is that you can create email templates at will.

I tried that last week, and even though the templates weren't that interesting, I was able to get some great leads from them.

How to Use Hootsuite to Create Email Templates

Once I started using the free account, it made creating great email templates a lot easier.

To use the service, you first set up a free account. Once you do that, you're then able to create any number of email templates. It's that simple.

The other great thing about Hootsuite's service is that once you create a template, it's yours alone. You can change it at any time.

It's a great tool, but it does come with a few problems. This was the problem I had with this service when

A couple of things I did here this evening. First, I changed my default wallpaper to the latest Google Nexus wallpaper. I didn't quite like it until I went and changed it. You can see some of the different versions there: http://www.somedaylabels.com/wallpapers/?id=17&width=300. You can see the Google Nexus wallpaper here: http://www.androidworld.com/2012/12/google-nexus-screen-off-wallpapers-and-wifi.html?c=t1329&sp=m. You can see the Google Nexus wallpaper here: http://www.androidworld.com/2012/12/google-nexus-screen-off-wallpapers-and-wifi.html?c=t1329&sp=m. Second, I tried the Google Drive offline app for Chrome for Android. It didn't work out so well for me. You need to have that installed. It seems you need that installed to be able to open the Chrome Desktop app on Android. I tried Chrome on two devices now. The first got it on its first run. The second time, the Chrome Desktop went to a blank wall instead of a new Chrome Desktop showing up on screen. I know it wouldn't be that easy to have that problem on a device with Google Drive. Maybe it's a hardware or OS limitation. It could be that the app doesn't yet support Chromebox. I've not got it yet, so there's no point to try it out. But the fact that you can't get it to work at all, is very frustrating. I really hope somebody has already solved this problem for you, and I'm sure it will work.<|endoftext|>As the U.S. government presses for harsher sanctions and pressure on North Korea, the Kim Jong Un regime has apparently been busy preparing for the possibility of a military conflict.

Pyongyang sent four-star Generals Kim Yong Nam, Ri Yong Ho, and Kim Kwang Hui to Japan last week, and the two sides are said to be talking about expanding and intensifying their "military mutual trust."

"They were to discuss ways to further build their respective military mutual trust through the two countries' defense cooperation," Korea Central News Agency reported on its website on Monday.

The move comes as the U.S. has pressed Pyongyang to abandon its atomic weapons program in recent months, even as the country continued to make progress in developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

"The U.S. will seek UN Security Council action on the isolated regime's illicit activity," a U.S. official told the Associated Press Monday. "But we hope to resolve North Korea's denuclearization through economic and diplomatic channels."

The official would not elaborate on what actions Washington might consider taking, while also cautioning against any sudden changes in policy.

Last December, U.S. and South Korean officials announced that a joint intelligence team would travel to Pyongyang to investigate reports that North Korea was building nuclear weapons.

The official said that the team would examine and discuss North Korea's nuclear weapons program with North Korean officials.

Earlier this month, North Korea's State Defense Committee announced that the army was on a "combat alert readiness" and that its "entire strategic force is on alert" in response to what it considers insults aimed at the government and military by South Korea for the annual joint military drills.

I love making things, it is just so much fun trying new things and seeing what results you can yield. I have a lot of experience with crafting projects I have been very fortunate to have learned from a great teacher and friend in high school who has been teaching me since I was a little girl. I think she taught me more about a good woodworking than anyone else. Every time I come home from work and the wood pile is full there is something new to make. For this project I used a box to give me a stable frame and a very rough edge. Once I hit an edge I would stop and scrape back down before starting again. The second week of this project I decided to add a handle and I put in a small wooden dowel to help hold the handle open. I figured you could either use a regular wood dowel (which could break when used) or drill a hole in the dowel that held the wood dowel in place.

The end result was a simple, sturdy and comfortable little backpack. I have used many different materials including recycled materials like

Suspiciously, he kept his job.

"He is at a very weak point in his health," says another senior government source.

The government official says Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee have given their approval for the decision.

The move to keep Arun Jaitley in the cabinet to head the Centre is a reflection of their trust in his judgment.

But Mr Jaitley is reportedly feeling very weak and his health has become a huge issue in the government. It also shows how sensitive the government is to these details.

"The issue is that Arun is now very poorly. People who work with him for more than a week and are used to working with him have been talking to him for more than a week now. They see it as a sign of his getting very weak. He has said he does not want to be part of the government and wants to go home," says one senior government source who has been close to Mr Jaitley.

While the government is not saying anything publicly, there has been a steady, worrying rumour about Mr Jaitley's health for some time.

In August, he called in the entire top management of the Finance Ministry because he had a severe chest problem and decided to go on a long walk.

Even before the election, the Prime Minister referred to Mr Jaitley's health as one of the most important issues affecting India.

"There is a need to have a person with great strength and stamina but also someone with keen sense of duty who is able to handle even extremely difficult and pressing matters," he had said.

But Mr Jaitley's condition has deteriorated in the last six weeks. Several senior officials say he now suffers from breathing difficulties.<|endoftext|>By: Daniele Ganser, Ph.D.

On the surface it sounds like a standard, everyday conversation, if a rather unpleasant one. The reality is that this conversation was part of the training that was given to our "Prayer Mentor" at Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament Church in the Philippines.

Our team of volunteers, who are part of the International Research Center, prayed the Rosary before each Sunday mass. The goal of the Rosary was to help our "Prayer Mentor" to understand what the Rosary is and how to pray it for the healing of the "wounds" of our souls.

Before the Rosary, our volunteers prepared a series of questions for their Missionary to ask when they were ready. For example, our volunteers asked:

"How many years do you have left to live?"

"How much money do you have?"

"Do you have any health conditions?"

"What are your concerns?"

Our "Prayer Mentor" was taught how to pray the Rosary by our team of volunteers who had been involved in similar situations at St. Margaret's Hospital when they were younger.

The "Prayer Mentor" had previously been asked to participate in a similar program, but he had not yet fully understood the Rosary's purpose and its effectiveness.

When Our Lady appeared before him one day, he was healed. The prayer of the Rosary helped to guide him as he was led to the Church, and he experienced a special moment of joy…a "fountain of blessing", as our Filipino volunteers put it.

We invite you to read the following short story about the "Prayer Mentor". After the story is read, check out the photo gallery of "Missionary 1" being healed by the Holy Rosary, and then take the Rosary and go to the Blessed Sacrament Church in the Philippines to experience the healing of your soul.

Our story begins when our Missionary 1 visited the Blessed Sacrament Church in the Philippines with a team of Filipina volunteers, and he arrived before Mass. As he went from one group of volunteers to the next, he prayed aloud, "Let us pray for your Church, in the name of the Holy Rosary for the healing of the sick."

As he prayed, the Holy Spirit appeared to him, and Our Lord said, "You are going from group to group asking for the Rosary." At the last group of volunteers, Our Lord Jesus looked at him and said, "Take the Rosary, and make it the focus of your prayers from now on."

Missionary 1 asked to be healed of his physical ailments – headaches, stomach pains, weakness – as well as his emotional ailments, and we asked our volunteers to join us and pray the Rosary for our "Prayer Mentor".

Our volunteers prayed the prayer and Our Lady appeared soon afterwards, and Our Lady made known to Missionary 1 her wishes to heal him with the prayer of the Rosary

A new study led by researchers at The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge has found that patients with certain high blood pressure diseases, such as hypertensive heart disease or angina, have much more of an inflammatory response in the brain when exposed to a chemical called polyphenols, compared with their counterparts with normal or low blood pressure.

According to the researchers' findings, published in the journal Nature Medicine, patients with hypertensive heart disease, which can affect 1.4% of Americans, and other cardiovascular diseases had significantly more of the protein C-reactive protein circulating in their brain. While this protein is usually found as a normal part of the blood to help the body fight off infections and inflammation, the concentration in the brain has never been known to rise above that seen with patients with high blood pressure.

The inflammatory response in the brain could account for patients' higher risk of stroke, memory loss and other cognitive issues, the researchers explained. This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and The American Heart Association.

"Because C-reactive protein is a marker for inflammation that, when elevated, can result in the damage and dysfunction of blood vessels and other organs, our study suggests that elevated C-reactive protein in the brain may be the biological hallmark of CVD, the main cause of heart attacks and stroke," said Jeffrey S. Karp, PhD, Director of the Perelman School of Medicine and a corresponding author of the study.

"However, we know very little about inflammation in the brain and how it impacts brain diseases," said Dr. Karp, who is also an associate professor at Harvard School of Public Health. "We think this research will help us better understand this complex relationship in all its complexity."

C-reactive protein was measured in blood samples from more than 2,000 people, about half of whom had hypertension, according to the study. These individuals were also given a drug to lower the blood pressure they already had by one unit. The blood samples were also tested for inflammation.

Researchers measured C-reactive protein to determine the level of inflammation in the brain, then compared this with normal levels of this protein in the blood. In the brain, this protein was often higher, indicating more inflammation, with the highest readings recorded for patients with hypertensive disease. This could account for the higher risk of memory loss and other cognitive issues seen in these patients, the researchers said.

Other research has also linked high blood pressure to high rates of inflammation in the brain, but the new results demonstrate that the response in the brain is much more pronounced between people with hypertensive disease and healthy people. Previous findings suggest that this immune response in the heart and vascular system is also more pronounced among people who are obese, the study noted.

"In healthy individuals, the inflammatory response is usually low, so it is quite surprising to then find that in people who have hypertension, the response is far greater than normal," said Dr. Mireille DiMicco, PhD, co-senior author of the study and Department of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Chief of Vascular Surgery, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, in a prepared statement.

A follow-up study is planned to look at the blood and inflammation levels in patients who had undergone major surgery and those who had not.

"This is the first time that high blood pressure has been linked to this type of inflammatory response to a chemical in the body," said J. Michael DiPietro, MD, a professor of Medicine oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was also affiliated with the study. "This study has important implications for our understanding of brain diseases, both those that we already know are linked to hypertension and those that we are still learning about."

"It is a good example of a study where multiple disciplines come together to create a more comprehensive picture," Dr. DiMicco said. "The data come together in a way that makes it easier to understand."<|endoftext|>After spending the 2014 season battling in the American Hockey League, forward Travis Hamonic has finally been called to the Islanders' NHL roster.

The Isles announced on Thursday afternoon that Hamonic was officially placed on the NHL team's roster Wednesday morning, though it wasn't immediately clear whether Hamonic made the team. There are two spots available on the roster, both of which Hamonic would be taking.

Hamonic played on the Islanders' NHL team last season and had four goals and 18 points in 41 games. He also signed a two-year contract with the Isles at a contract value of $6.4 million, while also earning $900,000 in bonuses.

The Islanders will play the Anaheim Ducks in a second-round playoff series. They will return to the postseason for the first time since the 2005-06 season.

LONG POND, Pa. -- The NHL is looking into how the Flyers responded to a fight by defenseman Luke Schenn during Thursday night's 4-3 loss to the Senators.

According to reports by Chris Boyle of the Toronto Star and Steve Mears of the Philadelphia Daily News, the Penguins and Flyers went at it like it was a playoff playoff game, and the Flyers had a history with Sens forward Ryan Dzingel in the playoffs.

Dzingel is also a fan of Dzingel's cousin, Steve Mason, who had a game-winning goal in Philadelphia's 7-6 overtime loss to the Senators.

"It really wasn't a hockey play," Schenn said. "We are definitely not looking at it as a hockey fight."

The Flyers have won two rounds this year and four of the past six regular-season games, but the Flyers have also been outscored 5-3 in the games since Thursday night. They were 1-0-1 for a month-and-a-half before the fight.

"I saw (Dzingel) coming back and I just hit him a little bit," Flyers defenseman Claude Giroux said. "It's not a big deal. You have to be smart at hockey games."

Schenn has two fights this postseason: one involving Cody Franson against Toronto last week and another in Toronto, when he punched a ref.

"He's the kind of player that you don't like to do that. It's not the kind of player you want to play against in the playoffs," said Flyers defenseman Kimmo Timonen, who didn't get to the fight. "We're better for the one. He just doesn't have the ability to do it.<|endoftext|>The following is an excerpt from this book.

A few months before I started reading The Man Who Would Be Pol Pot, the former head of Cambodia's internal security, I had a chance to chat with Pol Pot in his office. A mild-mannered middle-aged man, who had been known for years as just about the only man in his country who knew who was really in power, now dressed in a suit like a typical middle-aged man I know. But one thing stood out about him the moment I met him for the first time: the long ponytail he was wearing with an untied back hair.

He has just completed a tour around the country as the official face of "The Party's Revolution." He had taken part in public appearances throughout the country, at the university, during the national elections, and he was at the forefront of this week's march along the streets of Phnom Penh. At the time of the interview he was wearing a pair of dark brown shoes and a blue shirt with a silver button. My first impression was that he was just like every other businessman or politician I've encountered who has taken part in the Cambodian political arena in recent years. Like all of them, he was courteous and warm and I hoped that maybe, just maybe, he had not gone too far.

Before our interview, Pol Pot had already made a number of statements in the media. In one instance from 2010, he said that he didn't want his name written on the monuments and statues honoring the Khmer Rouge which are on a lot of major urban streets in Cambodia, a statement likely to create the impression that he was associated with the Khmer Rouge and that he had been an official of the party. As long as he remained quiet on their nature, Pol Pot probably wouldn't have to worry all that much about being labeled a Khmer Rouge supporter.

I was somewhat skeptical of this statement, even though it didn't have to do with Cambodia. My skepticism was only heightened by the fact that some of the most prominent public figures in Cambodia have publicly declared their distaste for the Khmer Rouge. Perhaps it's time to take a step back and look at Pol Pot's statements in more comprehensive context.

It's no secret that Pol Pot, a charismatic yet ruthless communist leader, made a number of mistakes at times during his long regime. Even from the beginning, he had some problems with his reputation in Cambodia. He was frequently accused of mass executions, rape, slavery, and the torture of children as young as infants. Although there is no way to prove these types of accusations, it certainly seems that the Khmer Rouge were responsible for most or all of those crimes.

In fact, although Pol Pot is credited as having ordered the genocide of the Khmer Rouge, many historians and many of the victims of the genocide believe that both the regime in general and Pol Pot himself have actually been the ones responsible.

Pol Pot's claims with regard to the Khmer Rouge have frequently been dismissed as mere propaganda, but despite this, he is still the figure most easily recognized for the atrocities that he and his regime committed through the 1970's. His statements, whether they were accurate or

In late November, the Texas Supreme Court agreed to hear a state case that could, if it stands, dramatically change the way Texas investigates and punishes child abuse within the criminal justice system, by placing an absolute ban on the use of physical force, or "a mere reprimand," in child maltreatment cases. The lawsuit was filed by the Southern Center for Human Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Texas case was brought by two 12-year-old boys, Ryan and Sean O'Bryan, who claim that a neighbor, Cynthia L. Martin, had "forced them to drink bleach." The boys and Ms. Martin are black. The case has a twist: The boys claim that Ms. Martin called them "n****rs" and then pushed two of her children into a swimming pool, and that Ms. Martin then locked them out. The case involves one of the most extreme examples of racial discrimination in Texas and it has national implications that go well beyond just one family.

This was actually the second time that the O'Bryan brothers had sued their neighbor. In 2014, Ms. Martin filed a civil lawsuit against both of them. The civil case was thrown out, citing prosecutorial immunity. In 2015, the Supreme Court denied Ms. Martin's petition to revive the case, and in turn, Ms. Martin asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. The case has been sitting in limbo since last fall. This week, the O'Bryan boys asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.

In Texas, the O'Bryan boys say, a single parent, who has no custodial responsibility, must prove "justifiable justification" in child maltreatment cases in order to obtain a criminal conviction. This makes the legal system far more permissive than in most other states. A child who witnesses the alleged maltreatment is usually absolved of all responsibility. And, as the legal defense of the late Antonin Scalia pointed out: "If a parent had beaten his child, he'd have a legal right to beat his child and nobody would tell him he couldn't. If a parent had been drunk and hit his child, nobody would tell him he couldn't stop drinking and hitting his child."

As the state's top lawyer, John Cornyn, said recently, "The state of Texas does not have an interest in shielding perpetrators from justice. The state has an interest in punishing them. It's pretty simple. So when a prosecutor says, 'This doesn't count. It's not enough to say the victim was forced to drink bleach,' the next step is to get somebody to show me justifiable justification, so I can say, 'Let's start a prosecution.'"

The Supreme Court has rarely agreed to hear a case involving racial discrimination. Indeed, since the Obergefell decision this summer, the state Supreme Court has only declined to hear at least four separate state-level cases about criminal justice issues, involving the death penalty, affirmative action, voting rights, and even state-funded school prayer. And in none of those cases did the justices say that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue, a major legal standard.

At a hearing in January, Chief Justice Rehnquist told the lawyers for the O'Bryan brothers that they should tell him by February if they want to go forward. If not, Mr. Cornyn argued, they should move forward with a lawsuit in Austin by September. But, Justice Kennedy said, "If you want a quick decision, this isn't how you go about it." He agreed with the lower court that there was no standing to bring a case before the Supreme Court.

In fact, since the O'Bryan boys sued, at least four other states have passed "stand your ground" laws, which offer a legal defense of "stand your ground" as long as you believe that it's reasonable to use deadly force to stop a violent crime. That would make Texas' law the second nationwide. The District of Columbia has long had it; it is now being considered as a possible model state for the federal "stand your ground" law. Other states, like Arizona, have already passed stand your ground laws.

Mr. Cornyn had a hard job selling the "stand your ground" law to the court. The attorney general of Florida, Bill McCollum, said that stand your ground laws "puts the burden on the shooter to disprove his claim to be under attack," and that "there is no doubt the right to defend oneself is constitutionally protected." Texas' chief justice agreed with Texas law enforcement officials that the state's law was "not intended to restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to use deadly force in self-defense."

"The fact that the law recognizes a duty to retreat is not a burden," Chief Justice Kennedy countered. His colleagues agreed, in part because the Supreme Court has traditionally accepted the theory that self-defense only depends on the exigent circumstances under which the person believes he is in danger.

What's new here

This is an old version of the game. It was not played in the first two editions of my GameFAQs.com game library because there was nothing good in it. And the second edition, not being very popular, was removed from my collection several years ago, I think.


With this version of the game, I've been working on improving the game play, but there is a lot more work that still needs to be done.


But I'm not taking this long, do you hear? I want to get this game out in one piece! And for that, this one edition of the game needs to be as good as I possibly can make it.


So I am adding some new content in this version of the game, which may be helpful to you, but it is entirely separate from the original content.


I'd appreciate any feedback that you might be able to give me so that I may make this a game you enjoy.


Thanks, and I wish you everything a very happy Valentine's Day!

That might have been the case when they pulled in running back Stevan Ridley from the University of Tennessee, according to NFL Network reporter Chris Mortensen.

The Patriots signed Ridley to a $4.5 million contract with incentives and a $2.5 million signing bonus, Mortensen reported.

NFL teams can negotiate deals for up to five college free agents per season from each of the conferences, and the Patriots have used this tactic before on players from Ole Miss, Florida, Florida State and Alabama to give them a taste of the pro life without having to give up much cash to retain them, but it's certainly rare for one to be signed for $4.5 million, especially when it comes to a team with one of the NFL's longest histories of producing great offensive skill position players.

Ridley also had offers from teams such as the Atlanta Falcons (who reportedly had a deal with him "in the works" earlier this week) before the Patriots swooped in and got him.

While a lot will be made about the Patriots' "moneyball" approach to building a team, they're still just a franchise that hasn't won a playoff series since the Super Bowl era, which is pretty bad to get fans excited for when you've never produced a championship. But in order to win a championship in the NFL, it's important to at least be a contender for now. If you're winning with talent that may or may not be on par with the Super Bowl-winning team, the fans won't be too keen.

"Ah, a new creature! A beautiful creature! A new wonder of life! A wonderful thing indeed to be able to tame on a world!" ― Anonymous, Dwarf Fortress talk thread. [UPDATED 7/14/12]

edit] Introduction

What's a tamer than a dwarf? A dwarf can tame any creature and can be tamed by anyone. In addition, dwarves and their pets can carry items and use beds, furniture, containers, traps and the like and can build structures and workshops. This article will cover the various types of dwarves and their uses. See 'Characteristics' for other attributes.

edit] Dwarves

In terms of attributes, dwarves are fairly simple. They will not carry any gear, will not craft any items with leather, and will have minimal training. However, as long as they are kept in an active labor, they may train as much as any human. The only thing dwarves don't have in common are weapons. A dwarf is only slightly more formidable than you.

There are several attributes that affect gameplay. All of these attributes can be toggled at embark or via the in-game config menu. Some can be temporarily altered in the menus:

edit] Dwarven Intelligence

Intelligence is a measure of one's intellect. Intelligence determines your chance to successfully create traps, construct rooms, and mine.

Intelligence can go up by training with weapons, using workshops, and learning from books. It will also be affected by any special training a dwarf may have received via training dummies; see the Weapons and Armor page for more detail.

The male victim was driving on Dundas Street S.E. just before 2 p.m. when three men approached him and demanded his keys.

Toronto Police Const. Victor Kwong explains that once the victim handed over his belongings, one of the male suspects pulled from behind him and opened fire, striking him in the leg.

"He did suffer some kind of gunshot wound, the victim did say his vehicle stalled at the scene, however they took off in an unknown location and have not come forward so far," Kwong wrote in a statement on Friday.

The male suspect, who is also in his 20s, was arrested nearby and charged with attempted murder.

Among the highlights is HTTP/2 for HTTP/2, an important upgrade which provides the basis for the upcoming HTTP/2 protocol and the corresponding protocol version 2.2.

In HTTP/2, the most useful and important new feature is HTTP/2 header compression, enabling the encoding of data that is often unreadable by the browser when it is fetched over the wire. This is possible to use because there is a compression algorithm that does a better job than the algorithm commonly used by clients, which has the downside that the user sees the size of the content.

If you're using the old protocol, you'd receive a 404 notice when the header is compressed because the size is not shown in the header. If you're using the new protocol, the user would get a notice like this.

HTTP/2 makes it easier to transfer large files, such as video, even if the server is over slow or unreliable connections. This allows web servers to serve these large files faster, making sites like Youtube much faster — which allows them to sell more subscriptions.

This is all great for the open web, but not if the majority of your users are on the slow or unreliable Internet. With HTTP/2 enabled by default on every web server, there is a good chance that the web server won't know how to deliver a large file.

Thankfully there is technology already available to help make large file transfers more efficient. One of the most popular compression techniques, JPEG compression, is now handled by the WebRTC technology used in many mobile applications.

WebRTC is an improvement over HTTP because HTTP does not support the technology, so it's essential that the web server support this to make sure that the web experience is smooth and the user experience is as good as possible.

We'd love to hear what you think about the improvements in the W3C Specification for HTTP/2.

The U.S. Postal Service said on Monday it will halt all deliveries next Tuesday and Wednesday due to a strike in southern California. The postal service said it expects to send letters and packages Monday, but that package processing is now suspended.

"We don't know what the impact of this strike will be" on other services such as package processing, said Postal Service spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby. But there is nothing a consumer can do to avoid losing a package unless the sender specifically consents to receive a lost item or to receive an item damaged in transit, she said.

The stoppage is expected to disrupt the delivery of several thousand items, most of them mail. Among those is a brand-new television, valued at about $4,100, that is a gift from an online store.

"They can either accept the TV and get what they want by the time the holidays are over and send a nice note, or they can get the money back and be happy," said Karen Nellis, a spokeswoman for the online retailer.

A consumer also could make a claim to the store — usually an out-of-state seller — for the money lost, Nellis said.

There are two kinds of packages handled by USPS, first class and Priority Mail. The first class takes about eight to 10 days to get to the recipient, but for packages that weight more than 20 ounces, it can take 25 days. Priority Mail, which packages letters, also takes about eight to 10 days at a slow pace.

The Greenback Trail is accessible on foot from the west and west and east from the park boundary.

The Great River Trail is accessible on foot from the park boundary to Park Drive, and is approximately 16.25 miles and a total distance of 1,100 yards. It is an 18-foot wide linear trail that runs for approximately three-quarters of a mile in a southerly direction. The trail offers great views of the park and the river and has a variety of hiking trails including rock climbing, a rock-climbing wall, an abandoned railroad bed, a few miles of flat and rolling terrain, and several other routes that you can explore. The best trail access points are from the east and south, and you can also access the trail via the Great River Trail from the west and west.

Rendering by Paul Condon Associates<|endoftext|>The Federal Communications Commission and the National Association of Broadcasters want to make it easier and faster for broadcasters to cut the cord and sell their broadcast television stations to cable providers.

The two groups announced a joint announcement Tuesday that it plans to work with the FCC on the voluntary transition to market-based pricing of television stations.

That will include a transition that would reduce the amount of money broadcasters pay TV providers as the money goes to advertisers. It could make it cheaper for broadcasters to pull the plug on their television stations and let cable firms buy them up for pennies on the dollar.

Broadcasters have lobbied against this, which they say would reduce the amount of money available to them to operate TV stations.

A cable subscriber must receive no less than 51 percent of the broadcast television license fee from stations that air in the broadcast television market.

Broadcasters that want to sell or drop their broadcast television stations will have to pay a fee to the government of $3 billion. In addition, the FCC is proposing new rules to require that any person who wants to buy a TV station has to make a bid that is at least one-third of the license fees that stations receive in the market.

This measure would prevent a potential bidder from simply buying a license fee that would be too small, making the bid much less attractive to broadcasters. If the FCC also had other ways of enforcing compliance with the bid requirement, it could get more money from the market.

This measure would prevent a potential bidder from simply buying a license fee that would be too small, making the bid much less attractive to broadcasters.

A second measure would allow cable companies that sell broadcast television stations to negotiate lower rates with broadcasters.

The FCC would not seek to change the rules for the industry because it already has strong rules in place.

The FCC and TV programmers have been working for years to overhaul the industry, which has been a source of revenue for broadcasters in a time when the number of viewers has plummeted. Many

The world famous and most popular Japanese restaurant, Daiseyi, was featured on the Food Network, which means that millions of Americans watched it and were eager to know where the real thing is. They searched all over Japan, but it's impossible to find any restaurants that serve real Daiseyi. So, we set out on a mission and searched the Web to find all the Daiseyijus (Daisei restaurants) in Japan, because the Food Network didn't show any Daiseyijus. It turned out that Daiseyijus were hard to find in Japan, so we contacted Daiseyiju, a Daiseyiju is a Japanese restaurant that specializes in Daiseyijus. We sent out a request to the restaurants and they were very eager to answer the question. We've collected the answers to the most common questions on Daiseyijus. Enjoy!

1. How to determine the quality, authenticity, and authenticity levels of raw fish?

A.: The "Raw Fish Rating System" is a method of determining the quality and authenticity levels of raw fish when serving sushi. Raw fish is not something that one should ever eat raw, and the "Raw Fish Rating System" has been devised in order to promote fish restaurants to serve safe raw fish products, especially when serving raw fish in the United States.

Each dish on the "Raw Fish Rating System" consists of three ratings:

A fish rating of "1" means that it should be cooked and served fresh right off the fish stand without any further cooking like sashimi and other fish dishes.

A fish rating of "2" is a raw fish dish that a chef or sushi chef should allow time to fully cook without any further cooking in order to allow the fish to fully develop its fragrance and taste.

A fish rating of "3" means that a raw fish dish served at a sushi restaurant in the United States must be cooked and served immediately upon payment from the customer even at the restaurant's table.

This rating system was devised by Tsukiji fish market, which is located on the northern end of Tsukiji fish market, the largest fish market in Japan. The "Raw Fish Rating System" was first introduced to Japanese restaurants by Daiseyiju, which is one of the Daiseyiju in Tokyo. Many restaurants began using the rating system and Daiseyijus, including Daiseyiju, began rating their sushi dishes as "1" when serving raw fish.

If you don't find a restaurant that offers raw fish ratings, ask the chef or head sushi waiter how they rate their restaurants' raw fish dishes. Most Japanese people would assume that the Japanese don't eat raw fish dishes, but this system does not distinguish between the two different styles that raw fish is prepared in Japan; raw and cooked fish is offered to the public at most fish restaurants in Japan.

2. How many different types of rice can people eat at the same time?

A.: No one has the right to stop you from eating "raw" rice. This is why the raw fish rating system was devised: to encourage raw fish restaurants to serve more "raw" raw fish dishes that don't require any further cooking. It's also very difficult to determine what is "raw".

The Japanese say that sushi chefs eat a lot of fish and only a small portion of it has been cooked. So, if you eat "raw" rice, then the sushi chef should have "raw fish". In Japanese culture, if you eat "raw" raw fish, then your soul or spirit is "raw". However, if a chef were to serve a sushi dish that has been cooked and prepared thoroughly, then that sushi dish is considered "cooked".

3. Is sushi a health food or a food for fun?

A.: The word "sushi" was first used in the late 16th century and came from the Japanese word for fresh water fish that are prepared by boiling them.

The word "sushi" in Japanese comes from the Japanese word for fresh water fish that are prepared by boiling them. Because sushi restaurants are so popular and there is a lot of interest in sushi, many restaurants offer sushi that is served with raw fish. The sushi offered in a Japanese restaurant should, of course, be cooked properly, but as long as it's not raw, then the diners would enjoy it.

4. What is the difference between "real" sushi and fake sushi?

A.: Because Japanese sushi dishes are cooked "raw" in order to be served, they should have no taste or odor of raw fish, so it's important to be sure when you purchase it, that the dishes were cooked without any heat. If the dishes did have the smell of raw fish, many people would not want to eat it, especially when it came in containers containing boiling water.

I thought we're pretty set here at the Statehouse on the issue of concealed-carry legislation. But now Sen. John Whitmire is hoping to get an exemption added to the bill.

The Senate has already approved SB 994 by Sen. Tom Willhelm, a Democrat from Lisle, and Rep. Terry Christensen, a Republican from Rockford. But the bill must now be amended by Whitmire.

Whitmire released a statement Thursday:

"There is an exemption in the current bill for a permit issued by another state that is valid for firearms in the state of Illinois. The current provisions of the bill will be amended to reflect the bill amended to exempt those permit holders.

"I hope that the bill will be amended and sent to me for concurrence."

Whitmire's office didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the bill.

Whitmire already said he'd like to amend the bill to include an exemption for out-of-state permits. He said the bill's exemption could be used to help people from other states obtain an Illinois permit in the future, but not currently.

Currently, state law requires that only citizens of Illinois may get a concealed-carry permit.

The governor last year vetoed a version of the bill that would have extended that protection to people who are out-of-state residents or have a concealed-carry permit issued by another state.

That bill passed out of the Senate Public Safety Committee unanimously.

The bill passed the House on a voice vote and now heads to the Senate floor.<|endoftext|>In this Aug. 27, 2013 file picture, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is interviewed during the State of the States speech to a joint session of Congress in Washington.

India's education minister on Tuesday said the country's school system was ready for a global transformation.

India does well in certain areas with low enrolment, she said, while some other countries could learn from its schooling model.

"I don't want to say India's education is perfect," Nitin Gadkari said to news agency Reuters. "I would be the happiest for the world if one country has the same standard of education that India does."

The World Economic Forum ranks India among the best countries for educating its children, in part because the government is investing heavily in an ambitious plan to double the country's national literacy rate to 100 percent by 2015.

Educating poor children was a priority for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and an expansion of schools has been part of his strategy to improve education standards.

In 2011, Indian officials said India saw its first free lunch programmes in five years. Last year the government also became the first to abolish fees to enter high school.

Schools do not have to meet strict standards of education but teachers are supposed to teach their subjects and their students are supposed to learn by actually doing them. The government has also pledged to give priority to poor kids.

A 2009 World Bank report said India's public school sector has low standards on average across all the country's schools.

"While we know that India is going in the right direction with its own education reforms, it is too early to say their achievement will mirror the success of other countries," the report said.

The country's government has long touted its quality system. And, India's National Education Policy says that every child should be taught, "with respect and sensitivity to their identity and cultural specificity, to promote their overall cognitive development, and to safeguard the inherent dignity of the human person and the equality between all humans."

It's still not clear whether the first baby born this year through IVF will be male or female. But the odds may not change too much, according to Dr. Kevin Esvelt, a University of Washington oncologist who has treated more than 600 children born through IVF treatments.

About 2,000 babies have been born through IVF annually in the U.S. so far. Esvelt isn't at all surprised that some of those will produce boys; babies who are conceived in the same way as female embryos often come out female.

"It's not a very high probability," he says. In an upcoming study, published in Molecular Cell, Esvelt and his colleague, Dr. John A. Galt, of the University of Minnesota, compare the risk of producing an extra X or Y chromosome to producing a baby who has only a Y chromosome.

"That's a little higher, but still much lower than we've seen in embryos produced by noninvasively," says Esvelt. "We don't know whether the noninvasively produced babies are actually the same children as the ones born via IVF. But we have to be very careful not to overstate the magnitude of the risk in the noninvasively [produced] population."

Because of a genetic mutation, people who produce a third X or Y chromosome after conceiving usually end up having only a single Y chromosome, as if that chromosome wasn't there, says Esvelt. Even so, those same people have "at least" 40 or 50 sex chromosomes, he says. "But many sex chromosomes are inactivated."<|endoftext|>We have the perfect home for your team at the 2018 New England Aquarium Aquatics Festival.

This gave the market some time to digest the information and think about if it was fair. We can now finally provide some clarification. Here are some of the things you may have missed in the article.

Oil demand fell by 6.7 mb/d in the quarter, the largest decline in seven years. The oil price declined by around 16% in the quarter, after being as high as $115/bbl in April.

Gasoline demand fell by 3.8 mb/d in the quarter which will lead to significant reductions in refineries running and in refining capacity.

Gasoline will likely come back to around $2/gallon in the next three to five years.

Oil refinery outages are not the only negative impacts of low oil prices. Oil tankers are not being fully filled at the ports while the demand for crude is declining. In addition, as an increasing amount of refineries close, we are seeing the number of people using gasoline and other products to meet local needs decreasing at the rate of 1 million per day. This is going to be a big issue for our current infrastructure.

The oil and gas industry has done its part to contribute to reducing emissions worldwide. The industry now accounts for about one third of clean energy investments globally (see here for more information on clean energy investments and emissions reduction). Oil and gas companies now have over $5.4 trillion to invest in the energy efficiency and renewable energy systems needed for a successful future economy. In addition, oil and natural gas production is responsible for more than 50% of all U.S. energy production. They are building new facilities to meet the long-term demand for their products.

Even despite the fact that demand for oil decreased by 6.7 mb/d in the quarter, there was a notable increase in refinery capacity utilization from 70.5% to 80.9%.

There has been a rise in the use of alternative fuels, from 8.7% in 2011 to 10.4% in 2013. For comparison, the United States is just 4% efficient with gasoline use (EPA standards average 66.2%).

We are seeing a shift of some of the largest refiners away from oil and toward renewables.

This is the fourth and final part of 'The Losing Ways' series. This article was written by a lot of people, but was mostly done by me. You can read the previous three parts here: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3

Here's the complete list of things that I have experienced which I have now come to realize is what I was conditioned to think were 'negative' things.

1. Being treated as an 'outsider'.

I was constantly being told that I was a 'stupid foreigner'. If I came off as non-Japanese I would almost always receive responses such as "how dare you think of yourselves as foreigners instead of Japanese" or "what the hell kind of language are you spewing out there? You're going to annoy me". I'd also get comments like "Do you have a sense of respect for the Japanese people?" or "I bet you're not Japanese enough and you should learn to act a little better on your trips outside the country." On various occasions I've been told to "get back to the right country" or "be thankful you're not even Japanese".

2. Being seen as weak.

On a trip a couple months ago I was walking from one hotel to another when I bumped into a group of about 4 or 5 Japanese men. They were talking and laughing all the way through and I thought it was funny until a couple of other men in the group began taking selfies.

One of the men stopped and started yelling at me in Korean saying "Why are you taking photos in Japan? Why would we want to have your photos taken like that? How dare you take a picture of your legs!?"

A fellow Japanese woman also came along and began asking me the same thing, "What kind of language are you spewing out there? Do you have a sense of respect for our people? Do you have a sense of respect for other people's cultures? Come on man, that's a little rude."

I honestly wasn't really paying attention to these three people. They were just talking amongst themselves, but the words coming from their mouths were being translated into English like my own brain. I could sense that they were pissed off and that one of them was pretty angry that I was walking down the street without any kind of ID. When I'd turn to look around to see who was mad at me I'd see all three people talking amongst themselves and it wasn't long between me and another Japanese man who decided to come up to me and ask me if I was okay, which I felt weird about. Finally one of the other men who was yelling at me began to walk away and he made a comment about something and I thought, "Well, if I hear that kind of talk from anybody again I'm leaving this person alone."

It never occurred to me, until I saw the photo I took the first time. It was in the middle of the city – in a crowded area – and I was walking by myself.

I took those photo, I thought to myself. I don't want to be talking in my own language and having somebody hear me in my own language. I really don't need to be doing that anymore. I'm going to be more careful.

In spite of this I continue to come across people who are very close to me and I wonder sometimes if the people I really want to see really know me. Sometimes, even though I've been with them for several years at this point, I feel like I'm just being used as a human ATM to exchange money.

3. Being treated as a parasite.

This, again, has happened several times, but my biggest recent run in with this issue is last summer when I went to Okinawa to visit my grandmother. My grandmother was one of the most prominent and influential women of the Edo era and the one who raised me when I was a small child. It was my intention to spend the trip there with my grandmother, but I also had a lot to do with promoting Okinawan culture outside of Okinawa and to do that I needed to go to places like Osaka.

It was just a few days before I was to return home to the US when I went to Hakodate and bought some souvenir photos of my friend Haruka from that summer. When I arrived to go down the escalator and was about to enter the station I noticed that every single person in the station was holding their iPhone in one hand and a big bag of their favorite souvenir. It was one of those moments when you're totally confused because you think the person holding the big bags is not going to leave the other one hanging up there for a while. I'm assuming that was in my head, because after I got off the escalator, the people who weren't holding the big bags left as well.

This went on for several minutes then people started to realize that this was not really in line with their policy. Some of them started

If he has his way, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will win the Senate seat being vacated by John Cornyn next year, his campaign announced Friday.

The announcement marked the second time in three days that the campaign unveiled the new target of their primary attack ads. The Texas Tribune reported earlier this week that the campaign was launching a $2 million TV push in the coming days that would include multiple spots about the state of Texas' economy and an ad about "a Senate candidate who has supported Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty."

On Friday, the Cruz campaign released new ad that attacks state Sen. Dan Patrick, Cruz's primary opponent. The ad makes clear it's not just Cruz's record on immigration that's been attacked, but a record on Patrick's record too.

"This guy is an abject failure as a U.S. senator," Cruz says in the ad. "No, listen to what Patrick has done. Look at the mess he started. Ted Cruz fought to stop Common Core in Texas, but Patrick blocked all attempts to audit Common Core and his own state budget. Ted Cruz fought to defund Planned Parenthood, but when it came down to an election, Dan Patrick was the biggest abortion-supporting liberal in the Senate. He's never been a conservative in his life."

The Cruz campaign also posted on Twitter that they would be releasing a full mailer featuring the spot on Friday, along with a list of its top 20 donors.

The Cruz campaign released this week's ads as they released separate statements on the candidates' respective presidential prospects. Cruz and Patrick announced Thursday night it was ending their run for Senate, but a spokesman later said the two were still discussing a potential primary matchup next year.

The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.

The Cruz campaign said it is not ready to make an endorsement in the primary race, but made clear its primary goal is defeating Trump in a primary contest, even though they're not focused on one primary race at the moment. Earlier this year it said it would not take part in the presidential primary race.

"We are not preparing to run out and spend money on a primary contest in Oklahoma, we are not preparing to run out and spend money on a Florida contest, and we believe it's premature to be running ads now to help John Cornyn in Texas — even though he is a senator elected by Texans," the Cruz campaign said.

I've used it for everything from remixing tracks to writing demos. It's what has allowed me to have success with many of my productions. I've learned from the best of the best, and it's helped me expand my vision as an artist. It has also given me insight into what is wrong with the way it works and what needs to be done to keep it strong.

In this article I'll be looking at my process for working with the Push. But before I get to that, lets look at what Push is and why I use it.


Why Push:

Push is a powerful automation tool that is open source and free to download and use. I've learned more from working with Ableton Push than any other software application. It's what has taken me from a complete novice into being able to successfully produce at a professional level.

Push is powerful in that it allows you to create sequences that can be linked together into a project. For example, here's an example of the Push sequencer working:

Now what many producers might not know is that when you start writing sequences in this way, you can also have it generate additional events in your project as well as your MIDI files. This allows you to create scenes and musical cues that take advantage of what Push has to offer.

The Push is the only software application I can think of that allows you to take advantage of that. I've written a great tutorial for learning this, so follow that link to be able to create your own sequences and cue points.

Here's an example of how using this technique can help you to create sequences.

Let's say you want the sequence to move through the sequence. You can use Push's timeline (or the same functionality in many other apps like FL Studio) to map that sequence to a particular button on your keyboard. For this example i'll be mapping the buttons to some chord sequences (1 2 3 4).

To get started, grab some MIDI (I usually use Logic or Ableton but some software like C64 works as well).

Now you can assign specific button values to the buttons you wanted mapped. In this example I've made two buttons mapped to "A" and "D" (note that I've named the

Bartenders who take their music and music theory too seriously and forget the basics are usually the most miserable people in their professions. Unfortunately, the way bartending is taught and performed by bartenders tends to reinforce this unfortunate assumption and leave bartenders unprepared for the problems they'll face in the kitchen that come along with their knowledge. That's why, instead of focusing on the theoretical, I'm going to provide some of my own practical experience and advice as I take you through the basics of what bartending actually entails in a modern-day establishment. I'll also talk about some of the differences, such as bartenders, which can drastically alter the way you view bartenders.

A good bartender, unlike a great one, knows that the customer is never going to get his/her money's worth on the first meeting and should always have their attention to the customer's overall satisfaction. A poor bartender takes an opportunity to show off how great they are to the customer and, even though they know it hurts the customer, they still take one more step beyond the standard service expected by the customer to receive. I think we all know that the customer doesn't care who the bartender is and if they have a certain preference from a certain bartender, they'll be unhappy with that bartender regardless of who else is in the bar.

Bartenders spend a lot of money on things, so it is important that they're comfortable spending money. This means spending on things that are not essential for basic tasks at work but that they are comfortable spending because they're needed to serve customers as well as other bartenders are.

If it's only basic things, such as cleaning out glasses, bartenders should consider doing them themselves but, if things can go wrong in the kitchen and the customer is going to have their drinks ruined it's better to at least ensure that a bartender is present that can help if the situation is a little out of control.

Most people do not have a background in music theory and, as a result, a bartender has to know what they're doing. There is simply too much going on with things like mixing ingredients and preparing drinks to not know when to use each of these things in conjunction with others.

Here are a few examples of mixing the two with their basic responsibilities in mind.

Mashing

When preparing a drink, a lot of the time mixing will not be necessary. Instead of adding ingredients to a solution, bartenders will add things just before serving, before they're finished mixing the mixture. These things are called "mashing" because a mixture of ingredients is added and then heated to get it ready for the person that will drink from it.

Sometimes, however, you have to keep things from getting too hot in the mixer or it will be difficult to get ingredients to mix together properly. You wouldn't leave it on too long or you wouldn't leave it sitting out too long if you were trying to get ingredients ready.

For example, you wouldn't be able to mix a strawberry jam with a cream soda if it's too hot. You have to stop it from getting too hot by removing the ice as fast as you can. If you don't have ice to remove, you have to take them over to the bar and pay $5 for a replacement (or $3 if you have an automatic machine) so the bar can get ice in the mixer and your bartender can have something to drink without getting toasted.

Mixing with sugar

Most people have a taste to sugar and it's something that they love. It's that same taste that they also know is incredibly common throughout the world and it's always available. Even though sugar is not technically "liquid," it just sits in the mixture until it becomes more concentrated. It doesn't evaporate (and is very difficult to separate out, since it takes that long to dissolve in sugar) and it's not as easy to mix it into everything because it's a thicker solution.

There are many ways to mix a drink with sugar which can be explained with examples, such as ice from an ice cooler, soda, etc. As a bartender it's your job to know how to mix a drink, both in terms of the ingredients and with the different types of sugar you'll find in the mix or available in the store.

If you've done it once, you know it

When I started out when I was still a bartender I didn't know a thing about basic tips and tricks pertaining to bartending. I thought that just because I was a bartender that everything that went right would. I also thought that most people would be more skilled bartenders than they actually are. It takes a long time and a lot of hard work to become something as well-rounded of a bartender as I am and it'll take a long time and a lot of hard work to be one that I can respect in the same way.

If you've taken on this job you know your basics and that you can understand

As an example of the wide variety of services that can be provided at no cost to a patient, I've chosen to talk to you today about a service that involves a few things called "Conducting Anecdotal Observations," as described in the Patient Care Guideline from the American College of Cardiology (ACC). In fact, my colleague and friend John Jorgensen, a cardiologist from Florida, is a consultant in this area of Cardiology, because he's done the work of providing free counseling to a group of new patients who come to his office as they try to overcome their addiction to smoking. You won't find any cardiologists recommending a smoking cessation program here today. However, this is an area of Cardiology where a considerable amount of research has been done, and there are some basic principles that you need to be aware of when it comes to counseling new patients with addiction issues to smoke.

Conducting a "no cost" survey on your patient's smoking habit is very likely to be one of the first steps that they will take in any of the numerous programs that are available for helping smokers quit smoking. It's a very simple thing to do, and the patient's satisfaction with the results is likely to be excellent. In this case, what you are going to do is to ask questions that will be designed to determine whether your patient has been using tobacco products or other illicit substances in excess amounts. Such activities may include drug dealing, theft, and gambling—and if you don't know how often these things are going on in your patient's life, you obviously can't be sure of a precise measure. One way to deal with this issue of whether a patient may be using a lot of other illicit substances while they are using tobacco products is to ask if they ever used alcohol, and other forms of drugs like marijuana, cocaine or other opiates—in fact, you might even ask if they took any medications in the prior 12 months like antidepressants or anti-psychotic medicines. If the patient says yes to any of those questions, your next question is whether they have ever taken illegal drugs when they were not under the influence, and I know that many of my patients in the past—especially my first patients I treated—have mentioned using illegal drugs while they were addicted to smoking cigarettes. But many patients in the group who call me don't make this reference very frequently or don't make any reference at all to illegal drugs while they were using the other types of tobacco products that I treat them with while they are using this other form of nicotine—like chewing tobacco, snuff, or "cigaretes"—and so my next question becomes whether they have said that they ever used these illegal drugs while they were using cigarettes—and that's a much different question. I try to ask them this question very early on.

If your patient says that they have used illegal drugs while they were using these other type of tobacco products, you probably won't find any good reason why they shouldn't be free at this time to smoke cigarettes and smoke whatever else they please. At most, you will try to help them use a little more moderation than they're doing now when that other dangerous product is involved, and if you are very successful in that effort, you probably won't hear any complaint about it. But the other thing that you probably will hear when you are trying to provide counseling to a smoking cessation patient—and I have done so many times with many different patients—is, "What about the other drugs and substances you have to treat? How many other drugs and substances do you have to treat? How many times do you ever have to treat this patient?"

In other words, this is an area where counseling is very good, because you can provide counseling for a significant amount of time, but you are not going to be able to completely eliminate the issue of illicit drug use.

My very best advice is to keep the discussion of this topic at an absolute minimum. It's almost impossible to talk to a new patient who has a problem with any other illegal drug use while he is smoking while using any of our other cigarettes or tobacco products, and you obviously shouldn't try to make that point very often if you are trying to provide a smoking cessation program to a new patient. As a new physician and as one who treats these patients every day with compassion and knowledge, you should talk to them about other illicit drug use once or twice every few months, but I don't think you should really talk about it very often if you don't want to make the point.

I can only speak to the general question on this point—I don't know how often it exists in the other areas of Medicine—but I can say that I've talked to two groups of young doctors who are in the process of trying to provide counseling and other types of treatment to many of the patients who come up to them with very serious problem areas that involve drugs or narcotics that they may have not been using when they were addicted to smoking cigarettes

They come in a plethora of styles and models and it's common for enthusiasts to have many different models in their collection, each having their own distinct character. The fountain pen is one of this brand's most familiar models, which are usually produced in limited numbers and come with a long waiting period from the time an order is placed until delivery. I've recently received an order from Pelikan on a number of paper models which are a good comparison with this review's Pelikan M400 and M201. While a limited number is typical, I'm finding more and more of the more popular fountain pen models are going up for sale. I'm guessing people are buying them because they are selling rapidly in the market. I will be posting some of my thoughts on the Pelikan M400 after reviewing it for a while, but for now, here are my impressions and thoughts on the Pelikan M201.

First Impressions

This pen is a bit different than I am used to for Pelikan models. I prefer a Pelikan M400 in the large Pelikan size to the medium or medium-size M400 in the larger Pelikan size. My preferred way to describe these nib sizes is that the medium nib is for people writing with a fountain pen with a cartridge as opposed to a converter and the larger nib size is for people using a fountain pen with a converter and a medium. The two sizes are very different and the extra 0.7mm between the medium and larger size nibs really gives them a whole different feel to me. The smaller nib size feels like a fine nib and the larger nib size feels like a medium nib. The size you choose is a decision you should make after careful consideration of what size your preferred nib will work best with and what nib will work best with your preferred writing tools. While the small M201 nib nib is a small diameter nib it feels soft and supple. It reminds me of a Pelikan stub nib I may have had in my possession back in the day.

The barrel and cap are a beautiful design with a nicely polished finish. The barrel has three rings that have grooves, like a traditional pen barrel, and the tines are all set into the barrel. The tines protrude at the sides of the barrel when not in use which makes them quite easy to write with. The cap is made up of three parts – the trim ring, the barrel part and the section that houses the nib section and body of the pen. As I previously mentioned the barrel of this pen comes with the grooves to give it a traditional pen look. The cap is metal – it's not a cheap plastic style cap. The cap and barrel are perfectly matched to each other and feel well machined. The cap has four screws per side which give it a good grip.

I was excited to receive this Pelikan M100 so I could start using my new M201. I have been wanting to take the time to write about this pen before I

I have not read all the comments, or the rest of this email, so I'll let my wife (who read more of the comments than us) take over and fill in the blanks:

"There is an old saying here in the church: 'What goes around comes around.' And if that 'go around' is the "Bible" (or Bible) as it currently states itself to members (and non-members of the church who use their own interpretations of the Bible), it will be an uphill battle to get those members to take notice (because they are so used to the 'Bible' as it is perceived by other Christians today and by their church leadership).

"This will be a long journey for me. And it will take the most hard-nosed, dedicated, and loyal heart I've ever known to make it through it…to get to the truth of our God's plan for His church to be His (God's) kingdom on earth now, and also to the eternity of that kingdom! I have no doubt my faith and my heart will be tested (by what I will experience and how I will respond) along the way, but I know, on my heart, my soul, and my soul's assurance that God sees and loves me, and that I will be called to 'walk uprightly before Him'…that I will find hope in God's promise that 'through many tribulations and persecutions He shall give you the crown of life,' and He will be worthy of the love and praise and admiration I will have for Him when I receive His promised crowns or when my kingdom receives its eternal destiny (if it ever does!); that is, when it is truly His Kingdom (which is the goal we all seek, to find the ultimate glory of God, and ultimately of His person in His all-powerful and all-loving self). I know I will have the opportunity to see and to know God…to experience His life, His love (through His Son in the person of Jesus Christ), His will regarding me, and His infinite power to overcome all things and to bring us the ultimate joy.

"What this all boils down to is this: if this is God's plan for His church, then it is my mission to "wake up" this church. And I do not intend to wait until I have finished in the church. I simply intend for the church to wake up when it sees the need to have a serious 'reflection' on God's character, His will pertaining to His church, and the true purpose of the Bible and the church. What this will accomplish is to lead the church to a true worship that is centered on the glorification of God, and his person, in His true image. And that will bring us to the ultimate conclusion that we ought to worship and be baptized in Jesus.

"You do not say it here but in your email: 'It's up to individual people on whether to read it. When I see it, it may be up to me how I respond to how it relates to God.'

"For those of you that have never read the Scripture at all before, you will surely be amazed that God could include in his revealed will so much to which you have no prior knowledge or experience. It will take the hard-headed, the most dedicated, the most loyal heart, the one that never gives away, to 'wake up' this church and allow us to 'read God's Word.' And if you've read Scripture for a long time, you will no longer be able to 'read God's Word' before you 'get there.'

"Many years ago someone told me and my wife (who has been studying the Bible on and off for years) that we ought to study the Scripture in the Bible, in the King James Version, and not with the 'modernized' versions of the Scriptures which are being introduced over the years. And she said it was because we would see things more and change our way of thinking regarding the Bible, etc.

"I'm sure you're as frustrated today in the Bible verses you don't know, as I was when I was a teenager. And you're right that you probably will need to study the Scripture to find out those 'hidden things and hidden meanings.' (If you don't have the ability to read or to hear, that you will also probably want to study on your own time.) The Scriptures are the 'teachers' of what we've chosen to do now when we read, and are therefore the 'teachers' of which we can not choose.

"In the Bible we find so much 'discovery,' which is why we read. But we are all human, we all make mistakes (sometimes many), and we should be careful that the Word of God (our own words or interpretation of Scripture) does not come into direct conflict with the Word of God (others' 'interpretations' or interpretations of the

A year after one of the most divisive and contentious presidential races in recent memory, Hillary Clinton will take the stage Tuesday night in the first nationally televised Democratic presidential debate of this election cycle.

Clinton won the last debate with Senator Bernie Sanders, who has refused to endorse her and has been highly critical of her record as secretary of state. But Sanders won the Iowa caucuses and a few other early contests on May 3.

"I know I'll have to be more prepared than I was the last time around," she said in a video message released by her office Tuesday morning. "And to my supporters and supporters across the country, I want you to hear this: Even if I don't win Tuesday night, I will be out there every single day, through the end, working to earn your vote."

In that last debate of the Democratic primary, Clinton said she did not see herself running for president in 2016 and said people should "get over it" if that was the case: After President Obama's 2008 loss, Clinton said then, "You just have to sort of move on."

Sanders himself has said the same thing in recent weeks, saying he isn't focused on the 2016 race and will "just go work for the people of Vermont." He's also said he was "disappointed" in Clinton's victory in the New York primary last week and that "we will fight until the last ballot is cast."

But in the video, Clinton said her view of herself hasn't changed and is that "when we stand together we can overcome anything," and noted that after his "unexpected, inspiring, and energizing" campaign, she hopes the message she is sending will be heard.

"I want to give you a big hug," she said for Sanders. "I want to tell you that I am here for you, and I will fight for you every single day from here on."

She said she's proud of the work she and her team have done and noted that "we are doing better, faster and stronger than in 2008."

But, she said, "we still have lots of work to do to elect a president who can get America to a position of sustained economic growth and long-term prosperity."<|endoftext|>It's important to remember that the law and the president's executive orders are very different animals. The president's power is limited just a little bit with his executive order. In fact, that power can be very powerful.

The president can put a stop to you when you have done something you thought was legal, but the president has no power to take away what you want to do once it becomes illegal (which I have heard referred to as an "unprecedented use of presidential power").

For example, I'm an advocate of legal drugs for a good reason. The president can't stop you from using them, but you can have the president remove you from the list of those who are legal in regards to using drugs. You still have the opportunity of ending up on the list of those who are not legally using drugs.

However, the way most people interpret this is that the president can take away your ability to smoke pot. But, you still have the choice.

But what happens to someone on the list? Well, that's your choice. The only problem is, when you do smoke a joint you are going to be in the minority.

Most people do not smoke in public, but about 60 percent of people admit to smoking a joint in private.

You can tell exactly how far into prohibition this is by the fact that many states have created a "dry" registry. Just remember, you are still breaking the law, but you are doing so within your rights as a registered voter.

However, most people are in the same position I was, and this is what gets people into trouble. They choose to violate the law and get caught doing so, but they believe they are not doing anything illegal until the government catches them. The fact of the matter is that any crime a person commits is still illegal. Even if they are on a private list, that still remains that person's choice.

So just remember, the law doesn't care what you want to do. Your government (the president), however, will definitely try to help you.<|endoftext|>The following is an excerpt from the book, From the Wilderness: On Living Like a Local, which is available on Amazon.com and Kindle Unlimited.

The new-made

the man who started out life as a boy

by James W. O'Connor

The word

The story of

the early days

of

the Church has been told

repeatedly throughout our history, and it is no wonder, for it reveals much about the spirit of the age in which it was written. Thus when Pope Alexander VI in 1534 ordained that Christian mothers should be given the privilege of baptizing their children at birth, he was addressing the problem that had haunted Christian thought and action all through the early Middle Ages and was a principal concern of the reformers and the reformatories of the seventeenth century. This question had been particularly serious in France, Germany, England, Scotland, and elsewhere on the Continent. Many of the Christian communities of these countries—as well as of Italy and Ireland—had been involved in various schemes to obtain legal rights to their children by which they might assume the right to baptize and perform other acts of Christian care. One such scheme was that of the Reformation of England, which, in accordance with the doctrines of the reformers, provided that all children, after six years of age, ought to belong to the church upon the death of their parents. But after this period, it was held, the parents retained the right to control the child's religion and its education. In 1662 the Catholic king and bishops of France adopted the same theory and set up similar rules for the future of Catholic children.

At Paris, as elsewhere, the father of the child might give it over to the church or to some other institution "in all things whatsoever he might command the people, or his officers who were there to direct." But it was his right "to choose his own minister, and to receive that minister whom he should call." As a member of the church the young child was bound to "obey, to do well, and [p. 532] to fear God, both always and in times of temptation."

In Germany the infant might be "ordained" or "subordinated" to the church but the authority of the church over its members was not absolute and the father might "exercise [p. 533] his jurisdiction and authority, according to his judgment and decision, for the peace and well-being of his kingdom and people." A Catholic parent, in addition, was responsible "not only for his own children, but also his brethren, for all the faithful and good servants of God of whatsoever order or place they might be." [14]

The doctrine of the reformation as outlined in the Council of Trent and in the earlier dogmas of the Reformers was that the authority of the church over its individual members and over the whole body of Christ was to be wholly limited, and only the supreme authority of the Church could be absolute. Christ, as the supreme head, retained full responsibility for the organization of the church; He alone, as head of the church, could absolve His members from sins and absolve all the faithful from every sin—for He was the true High Priest and the true mediator between God and man, and He could bind and loose all His children in heaven and on earth—so that He alone could be the supreme judge of the souls of men and that the church as an institution was the place of salvation for God's children. The child, however, was not to be subject to the judgment and authority of his parent.

This doctrine was a fundamental one and was taught by the whole of the Reformation, both Catholic and Protestant, as it was first formulated by Protestant reformers, who did not hesitate to say in their sermons that if the reformation was to succeed its first fruit would be baptism. A Protestant preacher in his sermon on 6 June, 1531, said of the new faith, "Christians, by the Gospel preached unto them, will know right well what their consciences require, and so, when they themselves are baptized into it, will put away old sins and receive new. As soon as their consciences are purified from every mortal sin, they shall receive the benefit thereof."

A Catholic bishop, speaking of his new doctrine, said, "With those who are in the Lord's flock, nothing shall be demanded which is not proper for every Catholic man's conscience." Protestant ministers, in a sermon preached on 9 March, 1532, said, "This doctrine of our religion is founded on baptism as the foundation of the new covenant, and to it all the children of the church, and children of men even as it were, of whatever state or condition they may be, are called." In a sermon preached on 28 September, 1544, a priest said, "This, then, is the faith which is preached to us from the book called the New Testament, and it is so much the more profitable for us, and the more firmly fixed, because it is so new, that all those who believe

This is the first installment of a series on the future of energy delivery to the grid, and the impact of distributed energy resources (DERs) on energy markets. To stay up-to-date on this issue, subscribe to the RSS feed.

On March 27th, 2014 the US Department of Energy (DOE) published a new study on the electric power markets to meet peak demand by 2030.

"The report examines the different options for meeting peak demand – electricity generation, demand management and other approaches. The report also considers the impacts of increased use of the renewable energy and energy efficiency markets."

The report notes that in order to meet the goal of meeting one-third of the country's demand without adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, the United States wants to increase its reliance on "baseload" electric power over the next two decades.

For example, they want to increase the share of "baseload" power to 31% by 2040. This includes gas, coal, nuclear and hydroelectric power. They want to reduce wind, solar and other renewables' share of this baseload share to 13%, 15% and 8% respectively by 2040.

DOE's goal is to bring the share of all renewable energy to 24% to meet the two-thirds goal. The report includes a section titled "The Evolution of the US Electricity Sector." They note that "there is an enormous amount of uncertainty about the future of electricity production growth in the United States and the electricity sector is at the center of this discussion."

They say the cost of solar energy is "expected to decrease dramatically." They believe electric demand is growing in "high-demand states because of the availability and affordability of clean technology to meet electricity demand."

The report also considers grid integration challenges that electric utilities face in meeting this goal. They say they face "complex interdependencies" and "distributed-generation and storage assets that must be properly integrated to improve flexibility in the grid and overall system operation."

They suggest that utilities are facing "challenges from grid integration, market dynamics, and uncertainty regarding the future electricity economy." They state "there is a lack of national and local coordination in addressing grid-integration challenges."

They believe "the national grid is becoming congested" with an "increasing number of non-concentrated renewable resources, especially wind turbines." They say that "it is difficult to coordinate the resources to take advantage of wind resources and solar resources."

They say that "the grid infrastructure in a number of states" is inadequate to serve large-scale renewables projects. They add that "concentrated solar arrays can become an impediment to grid operations, which is a source of concern as they limit the energy available for other purposes."

They state also in the report that "the demand for energy is expected to increase in high-demand states in particular because of higher energy costs, which are driven primarily by the cost of fossil fuels and natural gas." They predict that "these costs will drive the majority of changes to the supply mix to accommodate higher electricity demand" and "increase variability in supply."

They say: "As a result, the potential for electricity shortages on the electric grid increases." This "means that grid operators must respond by ensuring system availability and stability."

They note that "the electric grid has traditionally relied primarily on a small number of suppliers (generators) that supply large volumes of generating electricity."

They point out, for instance, that, "few if any of these providers have experience in operating large distributed energy resources (DERs) across the entire electric system and integrating these systems into the electric system."

They add: "At present, grid operators have difficulty determining when a generation resource would be needed most to maintain reliable electric service. When the generators are required most, grid managers must also manage the distribution system to ensure availability of generation resources throughout the entire electrical system."

They add: "Generators are not well positioned for managing intermittency and can become overreliant on the grid as a whole, which is why it is necessary to have a mix of power sources that can operate reliably and on-demand when demand is highest."

The energy sector faces two critical issues regarding the electrification of the public and private sectors, the report states.

First, the report notes that, "There is a shortage of technical talent to develop technologies necessary to achieve future electric transportation, heating, and lighting systems."

It adds: "Currently, there is a shortage of technical talent to develop grid-integrated distributed energy resources to control energy supply and control distribution network conditions."

The report concludes that, "With more than 6,200 GW of installed generating capacity (as of 2010), the United States ranks fifth largest in the world in installed generating capacity, ahead of only China, India, and the EU."

As a result, it adds:

Now, the two rivals are virtually running neck and neck in the polls. Both Clinton and Sanders have improved on their favorability numbers, while Donald Trump remains unpopular. And, despite all the controversy that surrounds Sanders (and Donald Trump as well), many voters are still still likely to back him in November.

In the latest Fox News poll , Sanders tops Trump by a whopping 22 points, while Clinton trails by 15 points. Both Clinton and Trump are viewed negatively, and both are viewed more negatively now than they were last fall.

Sanders' favorability ratings are higher than Clinton's favorability, but they are lower than Trump's. In fact, about two-thirds of voters (63 percent) have a negative view of Trump, and nearly half of voters (48 percent) of Clinton do. Sanders, in particular, is viewed favorably by twice as many voters (62 percent) as Clinton is (42 percent), though that difference only amounts to 14 percentage points.

In the latest Fox News poll, Sanders tops Trump by a whopping 22 points, while Clinton trails by 15 points. Both Clinton and Trump are viewed negatively, and both are viewed more negatively now than they were last fall. And in the wake of Sanders' victory in Michigan, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that he has pulled 12 percentage points ahead of Clinton in the contest (45 percent to 37 percent). In the most recent Iowa poll, Sanders led Clinton by six points (47-40 percent), while Clinton also led Sanders by six points in New Hampshire.

And, to be blunt, both Clinton (62 percent) and Trump are disliked by a majority of voters, so any negative perception of a candidate can make him a less appealing candidate. This makes the Democrats and the Republican field alike a more interesting election this election cycle than it is a general election.

But this is not the first time that Clinton has been at a disadvantage in the polls since the Democratic campaign began.

A Pew Research poll found some of the same results last fall, which shows Sanders (56 percent) beating Clinton (39 percent) when compared to the other potential nominees.

A September CNN poll found that Sanders was more popular than Clinton (58 percent to 35 percent) among Democrats and Democratic leaning (D) independents; this makes the general election an interesting proposition for Democratic voters. And, if anything, Sanders is currently gaining support.

A CNN poll also found that two-thirds of Republican voters (67 percent) would support Cruz, as opposed to Trump's 13 percent, while the same two-thirds (67 percent) would vote for Kasich in the general election.

If the poll's findings hold true, and Sanders continues to perform as well as he is, he would likely defeat either Trump or Cruz; not two likely candidates who are viewed favorably by a majority of voters.

In fact, in the last two polls, Sanders has beaten more qualified candidates, such as Clinton (60 percent to 33 percent); Bush, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio (all 57 percent); and Christie, Bush and Kasich (51 percent).

Sanders appears to be doing better among female voters, and his favorability is higher with voters under the age of 45 (59 percent favorable to 44 percent unfavorable).

In terms of the general-election debate, Fox found that Sanders is favored by a majority of voters (51 percent) — though less than Clinton (57 percent) and Trump (68 percent) are. Trump, in particular, has recently made disparaging remarks about Sanders.

"This guy's a socialist-slash-communist, and I hate socialism, let me tell you," Trump told Fox News last week. "He'll destroy the banks, destroy the economy, destroy it, right?"

Of the Republicans, Cruz and Kasich are viewed more favorably than Sanders currently is (Cruz is 59 percent favorable and 30 percent unfavorable among Republicans, while Kasich is 62 percent favorable and 25 percent unfavorable).

Though Kasich's favorability ratings have improved (37 percent to 50 percent) since CNN/ORC conducted their poll in September, he is still viewed negatively by about two-thirds of registered voters, so it would take a massive turn for Republican voters to consider voting for him.

Still, some

The 36-year-old was convicted of murder in 2012, but an appeal at the High Court quashed that conviction and ordered a retrial.

In a landmark court ruling in February this year, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan said the jury had been "misled" into believing that George had killed Mr Harris by driving him to a secluded place and stabbing him.

The jury had heard "strong and circumstantial evidence" that George had lied about going to a party with the murdered man, James Williams.

The ruling was hailed as a potential victory against a rise in increasingly ruthless online gaming.

'Disgusted with violence'

Mr Williams was playing a video game called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) on his computer. It followed a similar storyline to World of Warcraft (WoW).

On the morning of 12 April 2010, someone in the video game - believed to be a teenager - logged on to MW2 and started playing it with friends.

At about 0130 BST, James Harris, a 24-year-old electrician from Newmarket, Middlesbrough, logged on and played a game with another player called William Cuthbert - a friend.

At first, Mr Harris was enjoying the gameplay, but he then started hearing noises, including sounds of his playing.

He also noticed that Mr Harris had been playing with his right hand on his joystick. One of his hands was shaking.

Mr Harris later told police he became confused when they stopped playing. He could not tell them where he was nor who had killed him, although he did remember hearing George scream "stop it".

At some point during the game, George asked William Cuthbert whether he had seen James on the monitor, and then said: "I'm scared, I've been playing a game all night."

James Harris had been going through a hard time, and the two men had gone for a drink with the victim, who had recently been released from prison after three years.

They returned home after a few hours of drinking, and at about 2117 BST, James Harris said he wanted to finish the evening out, so they headed to the toilet.

He left his family home in Middlesbrough, and then drove to the parking lot of his local pub.

George - who was playing with a knife - entered through a kitchen window, went through the back door, and asked for him to come down the stairs.

He told officers later: "I was getting out my car, I was really scared, I had a knife, so I got out."

When he asked him if he had anything to say he didn't remember saying, he replied: "No, I don't want to speak to you."

The car went into what became a chase, with George Harris chasing James Harris. Eventually, they reached a cul-de-sac on the road where Mr Harris collapsed, but he did not die from his injuries.

George was then arrested by police in the town of Preston, and the evidence was recorded from a covert video camera worn on his person by police officers.

It showed George driving towards James Harris, stopping briefly near her home.

After they were arrested, George said he had been playing through the night and was trying to calm down - because he had been worried about James's reaction to him.

'He would have been happy' James Harris' father

Speaking outside court, his father John said: "George is a very responsible person. I think he knows right from wrong.

"We're not happy about this decision and I don't know how we will cope living with this for the rest of our lives.

"James's family are all doing fine - he always said that he had a very loving and caring mum.

"It's not like George and James were enemies, they were not enemies, and they had nothing to do with one another.

"I don't think George will ever have any closure."

Mr Harris has said the trial process left him feeling like a "pawn".

Judge Gilligan said he was not satisfied that the jury were misled but said it was "unclear" how Mr Harris could have identified George.

He also ruled out a retrial and said George was found not guilty in two out of the three proceedings.

A statement from the family of James Harris said: "James was a wonderful, loving son, brother and friend. Our family feels very sad that we have lost someone we love.

Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman has spent much of this week expressing his displeasure with the team's performance, going as far as to publicly criticize the offensive line. The line, he said, was responsible for the team giving up 24-year-old quarterback Cam Newton, who had a torn labrum in his shoulder in Sunday's loss to the Giants.

The Panthers have now lost four in a row -- including games to the Seahawks and Panthers -- and quarterback Derek Anderson has thrown two interceptions through Sunday after throwing no interceptions the week before against the Chargers. It appears Gettleman is doing some soul searching.

"The defensive side of the ball is going to be more important than our offense," Gettleman said, via ESPN.com. "That's what coaches always preach with you. When you're in a situation that you're struggling offensively, it's always my job to look and see if we can find some kind of balance or some kind of confidence in our defensive line. We're not playing the best football we can be at this moment, and we have to do anything we can to get that fixed, but it's the defensive side of the ball.

"We've got to continue to make it a little bit harder on defenses with what we're doing offensively in the passing game. That's what we're going to continue to do, and the coaches have talked about that. We're going to play better defense when we have better passing games and run games."

The Panthers are last in the league in passing yardage, but when it comes to passing scoring, they're third in the league.

But the offensive line isn't the reason these Panthers have fallen to fourth in the NFC behind the 49ers, Rams and Cardinals. The defensive backfield and special teams are the key culprits.

Panthers starting safety Tre Boston is among the NFL leaders in penalties, according to ESPN Stats & Information notes. The Panthers are one of only four teams to have two safeties lead their team in penalties -- the other teams to have more than two safeties at the same spots on the field are Seattle (one), the Jets (two) and St. Louis (one).

The Panthers are tied with the Dolphins for most fumbles in the NFL at 16 and have lost their starting left tackle Matt Kalil to a season-ending ACL tear that appears to have been a season-ending tear. Backup tackle Daryl Williams also left the game in the first quarter with an injury, forcing starting left guard Trai Turner into the lineup for the final 13 snaps of the half.

The good news is that the 49ers' defense is tied for ninth in the league, but that's only because Gettleman drafted linebackers NaVorro Bowman and Michael Wilhoite in the first round. Bowman has two sacks and Wilhoite is tied with Aaron Donald for the NFL lead with 3.5 sacks.

Still, it will be up to the line and the coaching staff to do better.<|endoftext|>It has long been thought that the early human diet was largely vegetarian, with animals comprising about 3% of all nutrients, although recent studies suggest that it was not always so. Our understanding of the human diet has certainly changed since the introduction of agriculture over 10,000 years ago, and it is now thought that human nutrition in the past was much closer to that of chimpanzees. The majority of protein consumed comes from meat-based diets, with about 75% of all calories coming from protein foods such as meat, fish, milk, milk products, eggs, and dairy products. In addition, the human diet is high in fat, which in most cases is from animal sources such as animal fat, saturated fatty acids and free fatty acids.

Animal protein

The most commonly consumed animal protein is made up of meat from mammals and birds, including chicken, beef, pork, and dairy. However, the human diet is far from exclusively a diet of animal protein, and a growing proportion of all the protein consumed comes from plants-mostly legumes, or legumes that are low in fat. There are no direct comparisons of the protein values of different foods and their animal sources in our study. Nevertheless, studies indicate there may be significant differences (such as yield of protein) if one considers only animal sources (such as milk). In addition, the human diet does not contain as much calcium as a typical Western diet, and the lack of calcium in the diet could be causing problems, including a higher risk of osteoporosis as the body attempts to remove the calcium through the urine. However, studies have shown that plant proteins are generally more beneficial to bone than animal proteins.

Vegetarian diet

One might then assume that the overall animal-based nature of the human diet should mean that in our study, the proportion of animal protein in the diet was high and therefore, more than twice the average proportion for the sample. However, the average proportions of animal and plant protein were more or

LONDON -- If the American Medical Association's board of directors and delegates want to take into account scientific evidence of the health effects of hydraulic fracturing, then they'll need to act now, before drilling in America reaches its zenith.

The oil and gas industry has been able to get away with saying that fracking doesn't increase health risks without much real-world evidence to support the claim. That's not the case anymore.

It should be obvious that the oil and gas industry relies heavily on a vast and unwieldy combination of misinformation, misinformation that is being repeated time and again on a range of mainstream outlets.

The latest, from the New York Times, comes on the heels of a recent report from the State Geological Survey, which was released late last month. That report found that fracking has increased seismic activity in the United States since the early 2000s, which suggests that it may actually lead to health hazards similar to those described by the EPA.

In some cases -- but not all -- earthquakes have occurred close to oil and gas facilities and fracking has played a role there. But in no case, the Geology report found, has fracking induced any increased seismic activity, and the magnitude of seismic activity is only a tiny fraction of the energy generated by natural gas.

According to the report:

It is premature to attribute increased seismicity to induced seismicity from hydraulic fracturing. ... Although most natural earthquakes occur in areas not connected with the oil and gas sector, several of the cases cited in this report are in regions that previously experienced seismic events.

To illustrate what the Geology report actually concluded: the state of Oklahoma and its surrounding area has had more than 900 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.0 and higher this year in the depths of the crust, compared to less than 25 earthquakes between 2004 and 2010.

While the scientific evidence that fracking leads to earthquakes is growing, the media, led by the New York Times, is still trying to spin these findings to fit their ideological agenda.

The New York Times' lead editorial states they are trying to figure out how the New York Times' own data has been manipulated. Perhaps the best example of how the Times tries to spin these findings is a graphic published by the paper purporting to prove fracking increases earthquakes, but with a twist. The graphic shows that, according to data it obtained from the federal government, the earthquakes that have happened in Oklahoma over the last few years have not occurred near any fracking-related sites, but rather near two towns that have both banned fracking and have moratoriums on it.

But the Geology report clearly shows that there has been no decrease or change in seismic activity across the United States since fracking began in earnest -- not in any area where fracking has been prohibited.

The Times' lead editorial tries to spin the results of the study by arguing that an increase in earthquakes is not necessarily related to fracking, but the Geology reports show differently. In fact, the report finds, there is almost no evidence of fracking causing an actual increase in earthquakes.

It's just like telling someone that because there has been an increase in suicides, then this must be related or triggered in some manner by their suicidal thoughts.

When people begin to question the veracity of the industry's claims about fracking and related earthquakes in the United States, they're pushed back into their corner, telling them that the studies have "failed" and they need to "take their medicine."

The Times' editorial is a perfect example of that. In the course of discussing the seismic events in Oklahoma, the editorial board claims there is no "smoking gun" in the New York Times study that ties fracking to an increase in earthquakes:

The Geology report contradicts claims that earthquakes related to hydraulic fracturing were occurring "all across the country," as the Times put it in the lead. The reality is that a very small number of cases in several areas were associated with a specific hydraulic fracturing procedure called hydraulic fracturing or ''fracking," which has recently been used to produce a lot of natural gas, especially in recent years.

The Times editorial board seems convinced it's the geology itself -- which can be influenced by fracking -- that is creating an increase in seismic activity around the United States. The industry's own records show this is untrue.

The editorial board isn't satisfied until they've convinced their readers.

This editorial is also a perfect example of how the editorial page of the Times functions. It attempts to tell you what to know without actually telling you what to know. And when there's disagreement about the science of health risks from fracking, the Times editorial board, along with mainstream media commentators, tries to sway public opinion by portraying scientific evidence as "conflicting."<|endoftext|>"It's not clear whether that's something that should have been done.

"We are an African country of European descent, and we need to protect our identity," Milan's deputy mayor said on Friday during a meeting of the Italian Migration Council — a body with legislative authority on immigration that has endorsed Rome Mayor Ignazio Marino and his proposals to close the detention center for migrants in the Italian capital.

The meeting was also attended by a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and by two UNHCR representatives from African delegations present in Milan.

Italy is one of several European countries where asylum rules are applied primarily according to the country from which people seek refuge. This is in sharp contrast to Western countries including France, the US and Britain, where asylum seekers are automatically entitled to international protection.

Italy has the highest number of irregular migrants to European countries — more than 10,000 people arrived in Italy in 2013. Many of them are economic migrants fleeing poverty, but some are genuine refugees.

Migrants are usually detained in Italian cities for six months until they are either deported or allowed to make an appeal against the deportation order in court.

The government maintains that in Italy, "illegal residents" are people "whose residency, while lawfully held, has never been valid, nor has they had any legal basis for staying in the country" and therefore may be deported "at will".

The group of women and children from Kenya, Sudan and Ethiopia were among those detained at the Milan detention center last October, after an order by the Milan governor to deport them back to Libya. However, the refugees say they have not yet been deported.

The Italian Immigration Police say they were prevented from giving the women and children a full health examination by the Italian State Secretary of Immigration at the detention center, and therefore "have to accept the diagnosis of the center as unfit to treat the detainees."

The group of refugees are being represented by UNHCR for the upcoming appeal by the European Court of Human Rights against Italy's actions.

"It is clear that Italian authorities are attempting to prevent the entry of refugees. If Italy does not respect the international law on migrants, this makes its relations with the West much more difficult," said UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming in Rome.

According to Italian law, migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia may be deported back to their countries of origin, if they violate conditions for entry into Italy for an unlimited number of weeks.

Madison County District Attorney Mike Fitzhugh said at 12:45 p.m. today that the charges and the evidence showed that Madison Officer David Anderson shot and killed 37-year old James Boulware in Nov. 25 on Route 45 on a rural road in rural Madison County.

Fitzhugh said the grand jury will meet again in January. He said the charges will likely come after those discussions.

He said the evidence against Anderson is pretty "solid." Fitzhugh said that the indictment is based on the fact that he did not have a duty to retreat.

Fitzhugh said the indictment is not a finding of guilt against the officer.

As a result of the indictment, Anderson will be taken off the street and have some restrictions while he is on bail pending trial.

It is time for a change.

The City of San Juan, Puerto Rico has a long history of using public funds to build, maintain and run public utilities and services that have failed in the face of competition from a growing private sector.

The government is now putting forward a plan to privatize these services and invest the money back into the communities. But the plan has not yet been accepted by Puerto Rico's voters.

What are the options?

There are five main options under consideration.

Option A - Puerto Rico's utilities privatized

A privatization plan that includes a public utility company and a number of municipal services – water, sewer, gas, electric, roads, waste - would be implemented over a decade.

The plan would then be monitored and evaluated over the following years to see the efficiency of the programs.

The plan would use the revenues from privatized services to build up a Public Asset Fund (PAF), which would generate revenues to pay down debt, create jobs and fund services for low-income residents

A separate revenue stream would be created by transferring municipal and public services from the public sector to private private partnerships (P3s.) These P3s would receive funding from the PAF and be able to recoup their investment by charging their customers market rates. (We will provide more detail on this system in a second.)

Option B - Puerto Rico's utilities remain public

In this option, private, for profit corporations would still control all public utilities on the island.

However, municipal utilities would be phased out altogether, with the most profitable companies receiving the bulk of the cash, and the government could offer tax breaks to attract corporations to operate them.

The PAF would not be allowed to earn profits, but instead used as a source to pay down debt from previous public expenditures. A third, publicly financed revenue stream would be created.

Option C - Puerto Rico's utilities remain public, but privatized

This option was the subject of a study submitted as part of the fiscal 2017 bond referendum in 2018. The study was prepared by Moody's Analytics; The Center for a New Economy; and the University of Puerto Rico. It looked at the costs of running a network of municipally owned utilities and a more traditional public/public partnership (P3) system.

The study concluded that using the privatized utility to generate the revenue for debt repayment would improve the long-term financial outlook of all Puerto Ricans, but most consumers would end up paying more in the long run.

In this scenario, the government would continue to control public service operations and charge market rates to all consumers, but it would allow private companies to invest and own infrastructure.

Option D - San Juan's public utility privatized, but the private companies are owned in partnership

At this option, the government would continue to control most operations and charge market rates, but will allow a limited number of P3s to manage city services. A private P3 and government would operate the same government-owned utilities on the island, but would partner to reduce maintenance and to reduce costs.

Option E - Public utilities remain public, but P3s to run service are not permitted

In this option, cities and municipalities would remain free to decide their own services and their own contracts with the P3s, but the government would provide only a nominal management role.

This would allow for greater flexibility with respect to public operations and would allow for the creation of a P3 to invest in municipal infrastructure without having to pay the higher PPI that would come with such investment.

Alternative 3 - Puerto Rico has two P3 options

At this option, as with Option B, the government-own networks would remain in place, but only two P3 companies would be permitted to use the infrastructure.

The remaining cities and municipalities would have the option to establish their own public/private partnership and choose to take on debt themselves, but they must do so with the help of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which would remain the entity controlling the infrastructure and charging market rates. It would also be required to make investments in the system as a condition of receiving loans and grants.

Moody's study also looked at alternatives 2A – 2B, which is one of the most popular of the two alternatives offered by the current government plan.

At this alternative, cities and municipalities would remain free to choose which P3 they want to use, but they would still have to pay a share of the infrastructure costs in addition to the public funds from the PAF.

Human Rights Watch compiled data showing that, on average, workers under 16 years of age are 12 times more likely to be employed in factories than are similar workers who are over 18. The report found that one-third of all factory factory workers are children. The average age for female factory workers in China is 19, the report found.

As The Christian Science Monitor wrote:

Many of the companies listed in the Human Trafficking in China report that they employ a portion of their factories—a handful, they often acknowledge—as temporary shelters for workers who, like hundreds of thousands of other women worldwide, are trafficked into forced labor in factories—often in rural areas. […] This was the third largest number of factories surveyed by Human Rights Watch, and more than 20 percent of those identified as temporary shelters are in the construction and manufacturing industries. The number of those factories employing workers under 16 who work at night—and the percentage who are female—represents nearly 20 percent of the total number of female workers surveyed. The Human Rights Watch report makes clear that these factories and shelters are not safe.

The Chinese government has repeatedly promised to improve working conditions in order to reduce child labor, but Human Rights Watch believes that it has done little to date. It says China is still the largest importer of child labor in the world.

"One in three Chinese children still work in factories in 2013, despite pledges by most governments to end compulsory labor since 2007," said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of U.S. and China advocacy at Human Rights Watch. "But government attempts to crack down on child labor have been plagued by human rights violations that include physical and sexual abuse and forced labor by child workers who should be at school and have access to health care."<|endoftext|>There must be a way to fix it, it cannot be an oversight, it needs to be fixed soon, this is an expensive way to fix and has been for years

[UPDATE: This post was originally published as a follow-up to an article originally published back in May 2016.]

If you have ever made a list of the things you love, I'm betting you've encountered the "I love…" phrase in somewhere. "I love working on cars" or "I love baking cupcakes" or "I love having cats" or "I love to travel and go on adventures" and so on. But "I love…" can be tricky. And because it's ubiquitous, this is the post that is supposed to help you get that one that really makes you say "Oh, that makes me happy."

One of the hardest things about loving someone is knowing when to stop. That's why I often wish I could just say, "I love you!" in one fell swoop. The problem is that "I love you" is something you want to say when you truly think it's true, when you really mean what you are saying. And then you can stop doing it whenever you want, without being judged. I'm lucky that I get a pretty sweet ride every time I say it, but many people find it difficult to keep the love they have for people alive.

The good news is that "I love you" is a good statement for a lot of things. It will make you feel good in some contexts, like when you just want to be with a person, like when the person is doing/talking/feeling good, like when you're talking to a partner about something that's important to you and needn't seem superficial. You can say "I love you" during any kind of emotional situation, in moments when you want to share the most intimate details with someone else, when you're trying to comfort someone you find sad (or angry or frustrated), or just when you want to get something or to hear another person's feelings aloud. But "I love you" is not just a statement of love. It can also mean that you're happy for a partner, someone you've given love to, someone who has given you love in return. Saying "I love you" to someone who has recently lost a friend or a family member or a pet or anyone else who makes you feel connected and cared about is a pretty powerful statement.

The thing is, you don't always mean the same thing when you say "I love you." So if you're not sure whether to say "I love you" to someone, there are five reasons you should always choose to say it.

Love Can Be More Than Just Intimacy

I've heard a lot of advice in the past few years, and I'm not sure why, about what you need to say to an ex-partner if you're going to stay in a relationship. But the advice I've heard almost always comes after a story like this one. "Do I have to go 'I love you' at every turn?" "Do I always have to be like 'Oh, you're so wonderful'?" You know how when your parents say that they love you they say it lovingly and earnestly, and then it comes across as if you never said it at all? That's what it feels like when you have to give an explanation when your partner calls and says "I don't have a job." It's like they're saying that they're "not sorry," and it just kind of goes away without making any changes to your relationship. That's how "I love you" can often come off in your non-spouse relationships.

On the other hand, you might not understand another person to that degree on a day-to-day basis. That's a very hard thing to communicate. Many people would describe their romantic love as "being on all the time, making plans, spending lots of time together, and enjoying spending your days together." When you're with someone, you can feel that you're at the "fun" restaurant or the movie theater at the same time as the person you're with, and you don't feel that same sense of excitement when you just want to spend time with them once in awhile. "I love you" is about being able to make plans that you are excited about and enjoy spending time with, and you need to be able to do that in all your relationships. I know it's a lot harder to be intimate with someone when you don't know them that well than it is to try to communicate when a few months into a relationship, you're still trying to figure out everything about this person. In short, "I love you" will always translate to "I care about you, and I care about you in an intimate way," whether or not you're together and you were just in a really good day with them.

Some people even go further and tell their exes to "do better than that" by not being such a jerk to their partners. That's true, but you can try to show that you're

[Editor's Note: This review contains spoilers for the season finale of Game of Thrones]

There has been only one season before this of Game of Thrones for the show's fans, but it appears that the HBO series has been in the works since before the series started. We're talking about pre-season, pre-publicity and, potentially, pre-production for at least two series, since the first season's plot points and characters were still being built.

For those who didn't know, Game of Thrones, a medieval fantasy series based on George R. R. Martin's novels, is created and developed by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who in 2012 joined a cast that originally consisted of Lena Headey, Lena Headey, Sean Bean, Liam Cunningham, Lena Headey, Michelle Fairley, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Natalie Dormer and Iain Glen.

But that cast couldn't stay together for long. After the second season was renewed for a third season, it was revealed that Kit Harington was leaving the show. And in January 2013, it was confirmed that Ian Martin would also be leaving the show, leaving just Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), two characters who have not yet undergone their respective metamorphoses.

While there have been occasional rumors of Thrones being adapted into a film, the show has so far been more than content to play out on the small screen. The show's main characters have gone on to star in multiple feature films. (Game of Thrones is one of the only TV series to make a film-length transition so far.)

If the show ever gets to film a third season, Benioff and Weiss say, there is a good chance that it will be its pilot episode. "Maybe we'll do it, maybe not," one of the showrunners explains. "It seems to have the right vibe, so it's going into production as planned."

In an interview with THR, Benioff and Weiss revealed that they have already begun making preliminary plans for a third season. "It's in a pretty heavy planning stage," said Benioff.

There is also talk of making other TV shows out of Game of Thrones. For example, some of the series' characters and plot points are so huge that they can easily fit on multiple episodes. "There are definitely ideas for other shows beyond this one, but the plan for them is for them to exist in George and Dan's world, but also be more standalone," said Benioff.

Benioff and Weiss also discussed that they have some ideas for other series that could possibly take place in Westeros.

"There's also the possibility for a whole series of other HBO series," said Benioff. "There are certain things about the characters of Game Of Thrones that just come from the sheer brilliance of the writers, and also from the story itself, which we believe is the best of any kind of TV show out there. We'd be insane to not explore different worlds. We've tried to stay true to the source material in a way that's as true to the source material as we can in terms of tone. There might be places we go where we lose some of the authenticity, but it is a world we're extremely proud and happy to have created, and want to see people enjoy."

As for whether Game of Thrones could ever get turned into a movie, the showrunners say it isn't out of the question. "It's always been an aspiration," said Benioff. "And no matter how much it may feel impossible, you can always dream, right? In a certain way, we've accomplished everything we ever asked of ourselves, and so it may be that there's a few series that we'd be excited to explore that way."

Game of Thrones continues to air Sundays at 9/8c on HBO.

" The Covenant's primary weapon is an array of plasma cannons mounted on its supercarriers and battleships. The Covenant wields these plasma cannons like a weapon far more powerful than even the Promethean constructs it defeated the UNSC. "

Covenant plasma cannons are large weapons manufactured by several groups of human organizations and sold to the UNSC for use by the military in their operations. Covenant plasma cannons are usually mounted on Covenant warships and capital ships.

The Covenant uses plasma cannon as a primary weapon, which are capable of disabling capital ships, including the Forerunner Dreadnought, in mere seconds.[2] They were used against UNSC ships in the human-Covenant War and the final battle on Earth.

Fossil fuels do not provide jobs, they are an economic drain on society, which only makes them worse when they are used, said an environmental scientist at the University of Alberta.

In his keynote address at the University of Calgary's annual Royal Society of Canada talk, University of Alberta environmental scientist David Schindler talked about how some fossil fuels can be truly "jobs killer" and that others should be considered "waste products" to be used whenever possible.

Schindler's lecture took place as part of the symposium "Globalizing Fossil Fuels: Energy Future and Resilience in the 21st Century". He was selected by the Royal Society of Canada to deliver the speech titled "The economics of fossil fuels," said the Royal Society in a news release.

Schindler is part of a team of researchers who examined the world's fossil fuel reserves and how much of them are economically recoverable as well as which of them will become economically viable.

He said the economics of fossil fuels is still difficult to define and that different groups will often have very different views.

Schindler said in an email, "The economics of fossil fuels is still difficult to define and what different groups think and think they know often turns out to be wrong. This may seem obvious, but it bears repeating."

One of the problems, Schindler added, is that it takes a huge amount of money and resources (in energy, land, and water) to do a fossil fuel extraction process, like mining.

"The problem is that most of these resources, if they are recoverable, need significant energy to be extracted or, at best, they require small amounts of natural gas or other sources of 'free' energy," said Schindler.

Schindler said in order to make a fossil fuel extraction or refining process sustainable, there must be a lot of renewable energy such as solar (which can supply all of a fossil fuel extraction process with energy) to power it. Solar produces a lot of waste but it also makes a lot of energy, which can be useful if there are places that cannot afford solar, as well as making it more expensive for those that cannot afford it. Schindler said even if fossil fuels do become a more affordable fuel option, the price of fossil fuels will still be expensive for consumers.

The economic problem of fossil fuels is made even worse by the negative effects of burning them and their subsequent effects on the environment and the human health, said Schindler.

While fossil fuels have many beneficial applications, he said using them can create social problems because of the impact on the environment, human health, and the economy, and even the future of the planet.

Schindler said, "What's more, as we use the economy to grow our economies, more and more land is being taken off the land."

"This leads to higher environmental degradation, water scarcity in regions like the Nile and the Euphrates, and a higher demand for food and other materials," said Schindler.

He added, "Overfishing, which is already an issue in the North Atlantic, has become a serious worldwide problem which will affect our own planet in the future."

The United Nations estimates that one out of every 11 marine fish stocks, which can only survive at high depths, has already been overexploited to the point that they are currently facing extinction. Schindler said that one of the most serious of those is the sea trout, which we eat on fish sticks in many parts of North America. He said that in some parts of the North Atlantic, the sea trout has already become too depleted to maintain a population and its population, which includes many species of fish that live at sea (such as cod and halibut) will disappear if we go on using fishing vessels. So what will happen? The fish will die off, along with the oceans.

He also said that as fossil fuel technologies increase in efficiency, it is clear that the use of fossil fuels will lead to a larger environmental footprint because it creates more energy-intensive processes to extract energy from the fuel. He added, "What's more, the use of fossil fuels increases the risks to human health as a result of toxic effects on air and water."

His point was a simple one, he said. "We must choose the right uses of our fossil fuel resources. If our goal as a species is to make earth a livable earth that supports life, we should not use it. If our goal as a species is to preserve biodiversity we should not use it. If our goal as a species is to protect fragile ecosystems for future generations, we should not use it."

What the "wrong uses" of fossil fuels are is often discussed. Schindler suggested that in many locations, we use the most energy from a fossil fuel and produce the lowest quality product because the best of us can't make an impact there, such

"We believe that some of the changes that come at the end of a war — the need for a transition to a new regime — will be lessened if we have at least some way that will be able to provide the United States military with a credible and effective means to take out targets in the most dangerous places where terrorists are hiding. … The other thing we believe is very important is for us to be able to make the transition from an intelligence-focused campaign to one that takes more of the fight to the fighting and allows for better cooperation within countries with which we're working against these groups.

"If we are able to put that in place with a few weeks' notice, it would change the tenor of the campaign dramatically … This change that Mr. Trump has proposed would make the campaign harder to do. It would increase the risk of civilian casualties on both sides, so I think that is one area, when we talk about the impact of Mr. Trump's policies, where we think that they have not been thought out very much." – National Security Advisor Susan Rice, March 5, 2016

Secretary of State John Kerry said he and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter "are working with the incoming administration. Our conversations include the use of U.S. military force as an option; the use of force to try to get regime cooperation. … There are a lot of discussions between the president-elect's team and the transition team." – Secretary of State John Kerry, March 5, 2016

If Obama had really wanted regime change in Syria, he wouldn't have sent the YPG to fight Assad, he'd sent the US Army to help the SAA.

Rice says the U.S. can't "make the transition from an intelligence-focused campaign to one that takes more of the fight to the fighting."

If it helps US war-planes get closer to ISIS and other terror groups, that's one thing.

If it gives the YPG and its backers a "decadence" victory over Assad and their Russian foes, that's another thing entirely. If it gives the Syrian Army's allies a "decadence" victory against Syrian Kurds, that's going too far, too fast.

US military strategists know full well the dangers of using force to overthrow foreign governments in the Muslim world. During the Spanish-American War, Gen. John "Black Jack" Pershing sent American tanks, cavalry, and artillery to destroy the Philippine Army forces. But it was the Philippine National Guard who killed thousands, not the Americans, and it was Pershing who sent his troops back home to slaughter many of them in the bloodiest civil war in history.

In Vietnam, as US units destroyed hundreds or thousands of Vietnamese cities, their Vietnamese backers sent American troops to kill them. As Washington's "vietnamization" continued in Southeast Asia, civilians were rounded up and sent to prison camps. The US forces were fighting the Viet Cong, but the war did not end. It just shifted from one kind of regime to another.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States has destroyed many countries, including Iraq, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, North Korea, and Iran. But, to the consternation of many Washington-fearing elites, these wars have not ended the regimes targeted by the United States. Instead, Washington has imposed "democracies" in some of the countries that were destroyed.

It has done this in many cases to make room for the US-backed Saudi regime, in which women are treated as second-class citizens. It also has intervened to topple Qaddafi in Libya in order to create a new, pro-US puppet regime.

A "Democracy" that has killed tens of thousands is not, on its face, a "credible and effective means to take out targets in the most dangerous places where terrorists are hiding."

If Obama wanted regime change in Syria, he wouldn't have sent that tiny, ragtag, little army of Kurds to fight Assad in January 2014. But now he and his team are saying it's worth sending those soldiers home just in case.

US war-planning is being run by the Pentagon, and the CIA in particular, against a much wider battlefield than just Syria.

The war-fighting priorities for 2015 and 2016 are not just the war on ISIS, but also against Iran, the Shia theocracy of Baghdad, Sunni terror groups in the Middle East (such as the al-Nusra Front and the Kurdish militia, YPG), and the ever-expanding "Russian Axis," led by the regime of Bashar Assad — a regime that has murdered and slaughtered countless numbers of his own people just to preserve his own power.

Image caption The government's policy is to focus on economic success rather than poverty alleviation

A policy paper by senior politicians which suggests poor people in England's deprived areas pay too little tax and cannot be expected to live on benefits has been criticised by the Conservative party as "simplistic".

The report is in response to research by the Trussell Trust charity and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

The UK government's policy is to focus on economic success rather than poverty alleviation.

Labour MP Ann Coffey said the policy risked undermining efforts to tackle the housing crisis.

The report, published by the former home secretary Sir Alan Beith, says more than a quarter of people who receive "rent assistance" in England are living in relative poverty.

Rents in the UK have risen by almost 4% over the past year and now average £1,724 a month - up 2.3% since April 2008, according to official data.

The National Housing Federation said there were now 2.6 million households in poverty in the home counties - where the largest numbers of people have been hit by spiralling house prices.

In Wales and Scotland, where public subsidy is paid for housing, more than three in four living in poverty are rent-burdened.

'Burden on society'

The Trussell Trust found that the average rent in Greater London was £3,976 while the average in the rest of the country was £1,638. This amounts to a difference of 1,250% (if you can bear to type that number).

For a family of four, the cost is £4,100 a month - £3,560 below the poverty line.

The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, meanwhile, says many people in London are renting from private landlords, who have an estimated annual bill of £8,000 per household per annum.

This compares to nearly £2,000 in the South East and £1,000 in the North East.

It adds this is "putting an enormous extra burden on societies".

The government's own work capability assessments suggest 2.3% of adults and 3.5% of pensioners are living in poverty.

The Labour MP said: "This report by the government's own think tank and its former home secretary Sir Alan Beith doesn't tell us one iota about the real causes of our social and economic crisis and the urgent need for radical reform of the way we pay for the services that most support our families.

"I have long called for a mansion tax to crack down on people who are being paid an allowance that leaves them trapped on the poverty line. I welcome this report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation but will be disappointed that the government isn't moving sooner."

Government figures show 3,000 more pensioners than in 2010 are earning less than the current poverty line.

And in the north east more than 50,000 more people over the age of 16 are out of work than in 2010.<|endoftext|>(CNN) As Donald Trump nears a potential November showdown with Hillary Clinton, who leads in most national polls, the Republican nominee's allies have been looking for ways to woo disaffected voters without alienating them.

That approach has included the hiring of Breitbart News executive Stephen Bannon, who has been pushing the populist message favored by Trump backers. Trump has also sought to woo women in swing states , with the support of his daughter and son-in-law.

His surrogates have tried hard to reassure voters that he would take their concerns seriously. But Trump's allies have also made an effort to court disaffected voters before the Republican National Convention begins in late July, in a clear effort to secure a convention bounce.

And as they push for a convention bounce, many of Trump's allies are also trying to figure out how best to court black voters in battleground states.

The Trump campaign is expected to continue hiring black operatives in the coming weeks, according to CNN's sources, after initially putting out feelers ahead of Cleveland about whether Bannon and other candidates would want to join the team. But it is not clear that those hires are helping the campaign at this point in the race, particularly given that the general election race between the two major-party candidates looks increasingly lopsided. The Clinton campaign believes a high-profile presence in the race from its black surrogates helps galvanize African American voters, particularly in states with high African American populations.

Even more worryingly, however, is the potential that Trump's allies may have lost influence in key battleground states after a series of controversies over Trump -- some of which have been centered around racially charged rhetoric -- including his recent comments about Sen. John McCain's POW status, his comments about a judge of Mexican heritage because his parents were from Mexico, and his failure to disavow the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

The American Civil Liberties Union, on Monday, filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump to challenge a federal order that bans immigrants from six predominately Muslim countries from entering the U.S.

The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco federal court, seeks an injunction against the order, which will take effect January 20. Trump issued the travel ban after the Syrian refugee ban was blocked in U.S. courts. The lawsuit notes that Trump "has used his official power and authority to discriminate against people because of their national origin."

The ACLU also argued in a statement that it has provided "ample evidence of discrimination" and "repeatedly warned government officials that their decision to order ICE agents to disregard due process rights would have serious consequences."

"The executive order is unconstitutional and un-American, and we intend to use every available means to defend this decision, including in court," ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero told reporters outside the court.

Trump's executive order has faced criticism within the media, and on social media.

If the injunction is granted, the ACLU said it would ask the court to issue a permanent injunction on the "unconstitutionality" of the order.

"President Trump has promised to reinstate President Obama's order that protected more than 75 million people from being torn apart by President Trump's Muslim ban. We're confident he'll do the right thing and end this unconstitutional ban," ACLU National Political Director Faiz Shakir said in a news release. "The ACLU will fight Trump's Muslim ban tooth and nail, until he admits to his supporters that it's immoral and illegal to ban refugees and anyone who's not a U.S. citizen from entering the country."

The statement from the ACLU comes a day after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was among the attorneys general who argued in federal court against Trump's travel ban. The ban was blocked by judges and later struck down nationwide by a number of judges.

The White House, in its statement, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

In a flash, thousands of online services and products, from Twitter and YouTube to the web browser and email client, disappeared, along with billions of dollars in web traffic.

The internet has since rebounded. But in the process, millions of companies have vanished.

As companies migrate their information to the cloud, they have to deal with the same issues. Here are five of the most common challenges they face.

Rendering to the cloud is hard

When the internet first started making its way onto home computers, it took years to get it to look just the way you expected. That wasn't the case with the cloud. Even today, you can get pretty good web design if you spend the time to make a decent looking website before publishing it to the cloud.

But rendering a website to the cloud isn't the same as rendering it to an actual page. Even for small tweaks, that's going to require a lot of engineering. When a website first leaves the desktop, it takes some time to render. When the internet got the cloud, everything has to render on demand. That means the same technical limitations that come up when publishing to the web remain the same even with the cloud, so web designers have to re-educate themselves on render to the cloud again.

Web developers have to create the same kinds of optimizations into their code, too

Even more complicated is the fact that some of the most popular pieces of web software depend on the same code rendering on demand. Some services, like WordPress, use the same rendering engine in mobile web pages to improve reliability. Others, like the Google Drive storage service, rely on caching algorithms that can be quite effective. The best of these works on most computers, but it doesn't translate to all of them.

It's a complex balancing act. All these features, while essential for their specific purposes, also make maintaining a site complicated.

Making the web faster again means taking the best feature of your code and giving it to a cloud service that doesn't have the same issues. That's why developers must carefully think through which of the features they'll choose to give up. A simple, lightweight rendering engine can be useful when there aren't any specific optimizations in the code you use. But to get the best performance you need the most power possible, which makes the choice more complicated.

For instance, an image loading animation is something you can easily optimize. But some web pages can actually hold images without breaking performance. The key is understanding how to optimize an image without breaking the site itself.

There is no single solution that fixes everything

Just because you have a cloud-hosted web site does not mean it will load as fast or as reliably as a site hosted on a single host. The key for your web application to get the most out of cloud

There were few women's shelters for abused women at that time, but some women did see lawyers who would take their claims. An adult could be arrested and jailed for an assault but not jailed, in part, for not being aware that the person had abused them. In the absence of evidence about why they might have assaulted someone other than for sexual gratification, the adult could be convicted of assault, with a maximum jail sentence of two years (the maximum sentence was reduced after 1896).

Sexual abuse of an adult male child was more likely to be punished than non-sexual abuse against a male child. After two rape convictions in London, the Crown Court judge expressed concerns about the high number of men convicted for sexual offences against boys. He wrote, "I should have thought, if anything, more was needed than a few additional cases, on which, in a jury room and where the defendant is represented by counsel, I think it difficult to convict." The only other known court decisions of child sexual abuse were the jury decisions in the cases of Alexander Verellen (1873) and J.H.F. (1874) where the father were found guilty of abuse but the father was convicted of child molestation.

Other jurisdictions took the Crown Court's observations and held that an adult male child could be convicted for abusing a victim who was a boy. In New Zealand, the law was changed in 1891 so that when a boy was sexually abused, it became an offence, with a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. In Australia, legislation was passed in 1907 for child molestations of boys, that included a maximum sentence of four years.

In the United Kingdom, child sexual assault was considered a crime of "the lower order of offences", which, according to a report in the Daily Mail in 1888, was because of "the difficulty of proving in a court of law that the accused knew the age of the young victim."

I would love to see that.

I would love to see this! I'd absolutely love to see this!

I would really love to see this.

I would love to have a companion in this.

I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I would love to see this game get an update. It's one thing that has bothered me for as long as I can remember, but after seeing some of the reviews for the original, I can't help but feel like that's the problem with most of the games that are sequels.

The story of this title was so amazing for the first time that it just seemed to make a sequel impossible. But now that the story has been revisited, it just seems that the whole "new" story and story to the characters just doesn't have the same impact or the same kind of feeling.

The game has some cool elements, which I'm just going to mention. It's very well crafted. The way the story worked with the game mechanics was great, and I really can't wait to see more.

For a game that was released in the 90's and has aged very well, this is an old game. I'm surprised that we have no official remake. Even on Youtube there are a few versions of this game, but the "new" version isn't anything close to being a remake.

I would love to see a remake of this.

It's been 3 years, and the only thing I can say is that this is a wonderful game with a brilliant story and that's it. The characters and the voiceovers worked so well to keep me invested in playing again and again. The game was so unique and had such a unique feel. I had fun with the game and will continue play it. I just hope that this story doesn't change the character so much that I can't see myself playing it again.

But this is all I have to say about this wonderful title and this masterpiece. As someone who is new to this series, I did not realize how beautiful and unique it can be. It is still a good game in its own way, and I really would love to see more of this type of game.

I would love to see a sequel to this!

Smith was one of the first journalists on Wednesday morning to ask Obama who he would vote for in November.

"I can't tell you that just now, as Congress is on recess," Obama said as the crowd cheered. "But I certainly know who I would have voted for."

As soon as the president continued with what he meant by "vote," Smith interrupted him, saying "But you said that before."

The response from Obama was a series of "no, no, no"s.

At one point, the journalist began to speak while another, Fox News Channel's John Roberts, cut his line of questioning. The segment came to a close by Smith saying, "So I'm assuming you don't intend to endorse any of the Democrats for president?" and adding that "they're the people I care about."

The journalist followed up that line of questioning by saying that the president seems "kind of distant."

Roberts agreed, saying that he "didn't really detect the Obama who we saw, just last night at the State of the Union."

"A different president, yes. More thoughtful," he went on to say. "More thoughtful."

When it comes to the internet, you do not want to mess with your ISP. But if this goes wrong, a website could stop working and then you might not get your money back.

If you've ever bought something on Amazon, you'll know about Amazon's refund policy. But a website could simply shut down, and you don't have a recourse.

This problem has become even more apparent as companies like Netflix continue to expand across the globe. But the best way for companies to ensure customers aren't ripped off is to provide good service that works when there are things to do.

In a new essay, tech entrepreneur and professor of software engineering at Stanford University, Matt Mullenweg, offers a way to ensure websites function when something goes wrong.

Mullenweg said in the essay:

One idea would be for a site to automatically pause loading for a period of time when it's getting hit. This would help the site continue to work, but would keep you from losing money. Another way to do this would be for the site to automatically go offline if the server goes down.

This isn't the first time Mullenweg has discussed the ability to control what happens when things go wrong. Back in February, he wrote a blog post about how businesses, like the likes of the BBC and Starbucks, were using tools to prevent customers from losing money.

Mullenweg explains that businesses need to have control of both ends of communication:

This is a great step forward, but it's not just for businesses: it's for websites too. Imagine if a website went down because the web server couldn't handle all the traffic. As a customer, you could have had a whole site to browse, but your money would be gone.

He adds that it means companies must offer customers a service they expect, and will stay up and running:

When a service fails, a site should be prepared to go offline for a very short time. This ensures that the site cannot break users' ability to buy or sell, browse, use the site while it is down, etc. And you can't pay to have that service work until after the site goes down.

What do you think? Will you sign up to service like this? Would that be the best tool for keeping your site up and running if it goes down? Do let us know your thoughts in the comments below…

I received this book via the author's publisher, Bloomsbury, as a gift for my birthday in January, 2014. I have read it thoroughly for more than a month while being away in India and the experience is that of a book by and for a woman – a very important point to consider if you are a woman wanting to write about feminism or women's issues. I enjoyed the book immensely and recommend it unreservedly. This book does not preach, preach and preach, however. While it may not have words that will stir the passions or change the lives of its readers, it does present an approach that is useful. For a first attempt, even an expert, it is a step in the right direction. And not just in India.

The first sentence – "There was a time, when everything was black and white" makes me want to cry. The author describes a time when we all stood and saw only the world in a black and white way of the world. We saw things in black and white, like the two sides of the same coin: dark and bright, good and bad. Everything that happened could be understood in the manner of good and bad, so why would we believe in anything positive to come of something bad?

There is a sense of hopelessness and pessimism in this sentiment: the black and white view of the world has been replaced by an outlook of not-knowing-if-anything is happening. The story of Ramashraya (or Ramjasumara) begins with the first day of the birth week of the boy. The book deals with the first month of his life, starting from that day when his father's name is given to him. The author takes us through the entire year when Ramaswami goes through various phases of his life. The birth of the son is not the centre of the story, rather it is the constant. It seems the author was inspired by this book, The Life and Times of Astrid, a book by the renowned Norwegian writer Lotte Håstad that deals with the life of the same character. (Lotte Hästad was a very important figure to me during my stay in India. She often travelled with me to meet with friends and fellow feminists. She used to teach at Harvard Law School. You can read more about Lotte Hästad's career here.)

The author mentions two stages in Ramaswami's life that are the subject of the book. One is when he is a baby and the other is later on when he leaves that state. After some thought, we learn that the first stage was the most formative one in terms of his character: 'When he was a baby he didn't know that everything is a choice'. The second stage, about three years long, is the time of the boy growing up.

Ramaswami's mother, named Panchami, tells us that when Ramaswami was small as a baby the mother-father duo sat in the house on the left side of the room. The father, the father-head of the household, would read a passage in the scriptures, while the mother-head sat on the other side of the room. 'Whenever it was our time to eat, we would stand on both sides of the table.' The father told her what he wanted to hear, 'What I had read in the scriptures and what I imagined for Ramaswami.' The mother-head would explain what she thought was important in that passage, while the father would 'look at her and listen intently'. 'The one who spoke the words he liked would receive the food…' The mother would be responsible for the care of the baby and the father for looking after him 'as he grew older'. All this was done 'with the purpose to make the boy grow up in a manner like that'. (p.17)

We also learn that when Ramaswami reached 18, the couple got divorced and the mother-head returned to her native place. Panchami was then faced with her task to put Ramaswami through the rigours of worldly life. A man needs to understand how women have been treated by the world. She tells us that Ramaswami 'became a woman'. Now Ramjas is a man with a job, a house to decorate and everything to do, without the burden of the old woman. But there is much to learn from this chapter: 'His mother-head was right all along and she could still look at them both and make a lot out of them. But the older he grew, the more she worried and he needed a woman's advice…'

From the age of 18 to 30, Ramaswami is very active in politics. A political party named Ramaswami (Mahasabha) is formed. Ramaswami is the head of this party. This chapter tells us not only about this political party but also about the personal life of

There was a lot of movement, and I would say 3-4 in front and behind my body but not to the point where it was uncomfortable. It didn't even bother my neck during a deep breathing session. I had just the slightest bit of pressure on the side of my neck which my neck does not use, which is probably why I can sleep with my head completely above neck level. It is also hard to believe that something is moving all around me, my body is completely covered. But I would say that I feel better and is definitely worth the money just because it will help with your neck problem, you're so small so don't worry about that. The other thing I did like was the design of the headset because it is not made from foam and looks so much better than a pair of normal looking VR headsets.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON — Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, on Tuesday released the summary of an interview with Hillary Clinton, in which she acknowledged using a private email server for her official business, but she said she decided not to forward any of the emails to the State Department.

Mrs. Clinton provided the email, written in February 2012 by her close aide Huma Abedin, that was sent to her from someone else. Mrs. Abedin was serving as Mrs. Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the State Department at the time.

Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, also admitted that she had consulted with "State Department legal counsel" for advice about managing the correspondence. Mrs. Clinton said she decided against forwarding the emails, noting that they were not in the record.

"I knew this matter might be perceived as potentially more than a simple convenience, but it ultimately was not. I decided, based on the factors and work involved, that using one's own email account was a reasonable and responsible way to conduct State Department business, and I took full responsibility for making that decision," Mrs. Clinton said.

"The decision was not taken lightly, but given I was focused on setting up an email system and did not have time to go back and search for other solutions. I wish I had more time to go back and look at everything, but I could not find another option that met my standards," she said. "I did decide, however — in consultation with the Department, and with guidance from the Department's lawyers — I could not safely and effectively complete my work of setting up and maintaining a new email account with the security measures in place."

Mrs. Clinton explained the email system was set up at her request, after she received a subpoena from a House committee investigating the 2012 attack on the State Department. Mrs. Clinton, like other secretaries of state, has relied on State Department lawyers to determine how and whether sensitive, classified information was handled and transferred.

It is not clear how much the conversation with Mr. Gowdy and Mrs. Abedin about personal email accounts and State Department email systems has affected the timing of the disclosure of her own emails. As recently as a few days ago, several members of the GOP-controlled House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wanted to interview Ms. Abedin to know more about the emails, but she reportedly told them she couldn't speak about it.

Mrs. Clinton also said in the interview that she was "not in the least bit surprised" about the existence of classified material on her server, but that it "wasn't something I was particularly concerned about." Last week, the State Department said the agency could not find any instance when email sent or received through Mrs. Clinton's server came in contact with classified information.

In a statement, Mr. Gowdy said the interview showed a "total lack of concern" for national security.

"She gave evasive answers with regards to national security issues," he said.

Mrs. Clinton, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, was interviewed by the committee on Dec. 2, after the State Department and former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell gave sworn statements. Mr. Powell said he had no knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server.

"There's nothing to hide - they're just trying to protect the country ... I'm confident that they're going to do what they told them to do and that's it," he said. "There's very little else they can do and we're going to see the consequences of that very soon." The comments come amid ongoing scrutiny over the government's surveillance and counter-terrorism powers in New Caledonia, which is in the process of becoming a UN protectee. Mr. Veney said the N.T.S.B. had provided details of the surveillance to the Canadian government.

Smith said.

Smith said the evacuation was initially called on an emergency of a suspicious package near the Copley Square subway stop at about 7 p.m. He said the area was being evacuated because of a "pilot error" that led authorities to believe there was another suspicious package a couple blocks away.

Advertisement Related Content Explosives found and Boston bomb device deemed safe

He said several Boston police officers, firefighters, and federal agents searched the area but could not locate the second suspect the initial search had yielded.

According to authorities, no explosives were found, though Smith said it had not been determined if anyone had been at risk.

One woman who lives near Copley Square said the explosion felt like someone was digging a trench through the ground.

"I feel like my house is being ransacked," said the woman, who did not want to be interviewed on camera, but said authorities told her all she had to do was run into her house to hide.

Smith said there was an active crime scene. "It's still open at this point," he said.

Police were still investigating where the package may have come from, but the area was cleared by noon Tuesday.

Several streets were blocked when the evacuation occurred, though it was not clear how long the road closures may have been in place.

As we were told recently, The Man in the High Castle returns with its seventh and final season in May, and EW has learned that season 7 will begin with the Man in the High Castle being revealed as its villain. In the first six episodes, fans had thought it was only a matter of time, but now it's happening.

Creator Matt Zoller Seitz told EW about The Man in the High Castle's villain:

As a longtime fan of the show, I'm looking to bring together the best elements of my past creations in order to do something new. And what better way to do so than reveal it is the most evil thing we've ever done — to have The Man in the High Castle be the villain in season 7? I hope that it plays to the kind of scale and scope that we've seen in season 6. We've been shooting in the Pacific Northwest. We're working with the original team — and we couldn't be more excited — because the new team is going to come in with an eye towards the bigger ideas that we're trying to get out there. In the past, Matt [Zoller Seitz] and I have both said that every year we go after the same story that's in the books, but then another element happens and it becomes a completely different story. This gives us an opportunity to do an entirely new story.

Fans of the original series will recall that Man in the High Castle's main antagonist was actually the United States Government – a far larger threat than Nazi Germany and a threat that would ultimately bring the series to a close.

The last time Man in the High Castle was mentioned in the credits for a new season, was in the fourth episode in the first season. It was during a montage depicting the history of the series.

The second season will be released simultaneously with the seventh season, which is expected to conclude in the spring. No official date has been set, but it can be assumed that it's around the same time as season 6 ended.

Most if not all of my designs and printers have been featured on E-Stunner, Makezine, Bunnings, Maker Shed, ModMyI, 3ders.com, Thingiverse, and dozens of popular Youtube channels.

I started out as a full time freelance CAD / CNC machinist working in a major commercial factory. I spent a huge amount of time perfecting the tools I need to produce the designs I sell and the machines I build.


Recently in February 2014 I became a full time full time 3D Printing entrepreneur and part time art director. The 3D Printing Entrepreneurship was the brainchild of my business partner, Josh. Josh had always wanted to take some time from his work to work on 3D printing full time. At just 17 he was very close to completing a degree but when the opportunities to learn more about 3D printing were taken from him the opportunity was too good to pass up.


My business partner Josh, and I met online and had been talking for years about my interest in 3D printing but we found there was no dedicated community for people like ourselves. It was a long time before we both finally started our own social media channels dedicated to 3D Printables, and in the next few months both the business, and the channel have been growing every week. I'm excited to announce that we've raised $2.1M in seed funding to date from over 100 investors with an average investment of just under $300k each.<|endoftext|>The video will start in 8 Cancel

SEATTLE -- The head of the Seattle Department of Transportation is warning drivers of the risk of deadly distracted driving incidents from passengers in rear-seat passenger seats.


The department says it's a top priority to educate drivers and provide safe driving practices to make sure everyone stays safe.


On Thursday, SPD Chief Kathleen O'Toole urged drivers to pay close attention to passengers and make sure their safety is at the forefront of their mind.


"I think it's a huge concern. We certainly all want to have a happy and safe ride and if that distraction makes it to the point where you become inattentive, the consequences could be pretty dangerous for everybody involved, including you," says O'Toole. "I think it's a real concern from a driver's standpoint. I know that from an enforcement perspective we do get a few [distracted driving-related] tickets each year that we can investigate."


O'Toole says the first thing she tells drivers is that you should always be in control.


"When the car is in motion at any part of the travel cycle, we are operating the car and we are looking to see that people are not in a distraction and it is not in their best interest and then we will look for an opportunity to make changes to the vehicle," she says.


The department also encourages anyone under the age of 16 that is using a cell phone to pull over and not drive unless they're using a hands-free device.


In fact, all new drivers are required to use a hands-free device for one year in advance so they know that the rules are being enforced, too.


With the increased focus on distracted driving, O'Toole says they're currently working with retailers, local agencies and the transportation agency, King County Metro to see what they can do to make life an even greater distraction for all drivers.


She says if that doesn't work, they can issue warnings to drivers on roadsides where there are frequent distractions while in transit.


"I know that we have the option to send an enforcement officer [onto the roadsides], but as I talked with the retail owners I know that they are willing to work as part of the solution as well," says O'Toole. "But we need to have more people working together on this so that this isn't happening every day."


O'Toole says she'll continue to do everything she can on her end to keep people safe on the roads.<|endoftext|>In the latest twist to the saga of former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a former Bain partner has filed a lawsuit alleging that the presumptive GOP nominee profited from a firm's alleged use of offshore tax havens during a period spanning his time at the helm of the firm in the early 1990s.

The lawsuit, obtained by Fortune, was filed in Delaware Superior Court and seeks to depose Romney as well as Bain Capital executives Kenneth Lay and the company's former president, Richard Brookfield.

According to the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday, Romney used his role at Bain "to exploit a tax haven scheme" that permitted him to avoid a tax bill related to a "sham investment," in order to increase returns for Bain.

As Fortune previously reported:

In the most comprehensive investigation of Romney's relationship with Bain over his years with Bain Capital, The New York Times last week asked readers to help it verify one thing: that Romney had worked "with partners on complex deals to take advantage of a tax arrangement that had been established to help protect U.S. companies in European Union countries from cheap imports."

The Times looked no further than Bain's former head office in Switzerland (where investors in the offshore companies who invested in the firm's pension funds, in turn, were located) for an answer.

The Times asked readers to send in information about offshore investments that Bain had made for its clients. If Bain had invested in offshore companies in offshore tax havens, the Times asked, "Do you have any knowledge of Mr. Romney, then a partner, participating in any of them?"

Of the more than 400,000 replies sent to the Times, only two mentioned Bain at all—one claiming he had invested in a company in Luxembourg that Bain did not manage and the other confirming that Romney was a Bain employee and that he had been "involved in a deal where he had to sign a release for a project that was not Bain's responsibility."

That's an odd way to get any "knowledge" about Bain.

As I previously reported, as well,

[E]verything is different today. It is now widely known that Romney was a corporate jet pilot for Bain at the time of their business partnerships—he was one of the largest beneficiaries of the fund. Romney, a private equity expert, and his partner at Bain was Robert T. Kiyosaki. When the tax advantage of putting the company's investment in Europe in

One, the whole "hacking is bad" business and the people that have made a living off of it. Two, the idea of having a "safe space." The idea of the Internet being a safe space because it doesn't encourage people to be mean. I like the idea of the Internet, mostly because it's safe. This leads to the third thing I'm going to talk about, which is the idea of "inclusion," aka equality with people on your side of the table.

I like many of the things about the Internet, but I also want it to be as inclusive and friendly as possible. This was my reason for starting a blog called The Unbearable Whiteness of Women. It's about the problems of whiteness in the media, and as such, I think it can be very helpful for people.

Recently, I've been listening to a few podcasts about how women in sports get treated. Like an "In your face," I guess, they're getting harassed everywhere they go online. What does it look like when you take people like the NFL and the NFL players, the people from the NBA, the people from the NHL, or people that cover basketball, and put them in a room against each other? Does one be more hostile to the other? That's what these podcast have been talking about. They're talking about the "In your face" treatment that men have in front of girls. This is something I'm also starting to care about, like I don't want to be the person I look like, I don't want to have to deal with that every day of my life.

It wasn't until I learned about this stuff that it all became clear for me. I'm so used to the people from media being friendly with the people they cover. I love their coverage of different sports. I love that they come out to the city where their story is set, they show their fans the love, while at the same time being a real person. I love that they have the confidence to bring the most popular sport in the world to their hometown, to the people in their community. What I didn't know about is the harassment that can come with it.

We saw something like this with the NBA, when their commissioner was booed off the court for saying something that was against Twitter and Twitter rules against vulgar language during an interview. The audience was upset by that. People made an angry comment or two against the commissioner and that was that.

When a man and a woman are on my side of the table, I'm not going to worry about how we treat each other. I'm going to worry about how we treat the people in this room. How we treat me. How we treat other people. It's important to talk about it when someone like NBA commissioner Adam Silver is being booed off-court on a live TV broadcast. It's important to talk about it when NBA players are getting booed at games all over the world for having sexual relationships outside of their marriage.

It's important to talk about what we're about and where our priorities are. In the comments section of any site I have any connection with (The Unbearable Whiteness of Women, my site, other social media accounts, or even just a phone call), we get to talk about this stuff. It's important to talk about it, and we can all agree that it's a pain for the person that is getting bullied. There are so many people that are trying so hard to make us all feel comfortable and safe, and this is the one thing they're being denied! I want to try and make the community at The Unbearably Whiteness of Women a place I feel safe and welcome. The one where people are allowed to talk about whatever and feel comfortable, because I would hope that's the case in every community, but I do know that it's not everywhere.

In his recent post, a reader asks the following question:

What do you do if you just found out you have type 2 diabetes? The good news is that it isn't terminal (according to the Mayo Clinic) so don't immediately start panicking. Here are three things a diabetic should do to keep healthy: Get tested for diabetes at least once every 3 years (see above for what to do if your test comes back negative).

Have a blood panel. We have three major blood panels: a fasting blood test, a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test, and a lipid profile (basically fat and carb breakdown, plus inflammation and blood sugar). Your physician or a health consultant can help you find the healthiest one for you.

Eat more whole grains, fruits, veggies, and lean protein. These will help reduce your blood sugar levels, which can lower your risk of kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Eat healthy fats — olive oil, nuts, avocados — that also help lower your blood sugar.

What if I have diabetes and am not yet on medication that controls sugar? You should start on diet and lifestyle changes as soon as you become aware of your condition. Check out our list of the Top 7 Ways to Stop Diabetes, which includes things like not smoking, not drinking, and getting enough healthy fats.<|endoftext|>Welcome to the

A football fan who was caught drinking while watching Wales v Republic of Ireland in the Euro 2016 semi-final has apologised for his behaviour.

Kai Reale, 28, from Cardiff, was seen drinking beer and wine at an Irish pub in Cardiff while watching his country in a Euro 2016 warm-up match in Marseille on Wednesday night.

The sports drink manufacturer's website warns users not to drink alcohol while consuming a sports drink, according to the Independent.

But Reale told the newspaper: "I was drunk and didn't realise how much alcohol I had."

Reale, who also played for the Cardiff Blues RFC, then told his wife about the incident after the match.

He said: "I would apologise to anyone who was offended, and if there is any offence caused I apologise for that. I wouldn't want anyone to feel that way – I never want to be seen in a bad light."

The phone will get faster data speeds on one of T-Mobile's HSPA+ or LTE mobile networks when it is connected to Boost Mobile's LTE network, as the name suggests.

"Boost Mobile is the first and only commercial ISP capable of providing the high-speed LTE coverage that consumers need to keep up with their mobile needs," the carrier said to Ars Technica. "Boost customers with Boost Mobile are able to access faster speeds with a broad selection of devices."

In short, you can have a good experience with Boost. But not really.

Why are you talking about a "boost" network in the first place?

If your device is capable of using LTE, you probably know that there is a Boost Mobile network that exists, available in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Guam. And while it's not an entirely free network, we would say it's a pretty great deal, particularly if you're moving between LTE networks quite often.

HALIFAX — The Nova Scotia government says it has lost $13 million over a period where it did not provide medical marijuana to terminally ill patients.

Nova Scotia's health minister, Leo Glavine, said Wednesday that the government made a mistake last year by not providing access to medical marijuana to terminally ill people that was allowed under the Canada Health Act.

In April, the province announced it would not allow patients, caregivers and their children to grow their own marijuana. They would have to buy their marijuana from licensed producers.

The decision was criticized quickly because a 2014 survey indicated that 74 per cent of Nova Scotians support a move to allow marijuana for medicinal purposes.

But Nova Scotia Health says it has now lost tens of millions of dollars as a result of that decision.

Glavine said a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers has revealed that it will cost $13.6 million to get patients their drug supply that was supposed to be available by the end of July 2016.<|endoftext|>The number of people who have died as a result of the H5N8 bird flu virus has reached around 2,000.

That is according to the WHO's new report on the H5 outbreak and is far higher than the 800 cases estimated by the world's health organization, the World Health Organization. WHO's new report published on Thursday also found that no countries have yet eliminated the virus.

At the end of January, a total of 582 cases of human H5N8 influenza virus infection had been identified in 37 countries, according to the new WHO report. The WHO reports that 1,527 of those have died since the beginning of this year, while the remaining are still ill.

The WHO said that of the remaining 1,813 cases, it has recorded 1,005 deaths from January to October, bringing the total to 2,007 people who have died in the past 31 days. H5N8 is believed to be a human strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus.

Meanwhile, cases of human H5N8 influenza virus infection have also been reported in the United States, Korea and China.

"H5N8 is now a global health risk. This virus is rapidly spreading to new countries and is now associated with serious human illnesses," Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, WHO, said.

"WHO will continue to work for the elimination of this virus, and for global support to global and regional efforts to halt its spread."

My anxiety seemed to be based upon the fact I didn't belong. I thought that by showing weakness it would be an indicator of weakness and that I was not as important, or that I was not as intelligent. I was told that my natural anxiety was a form of insecurity, that I didn't like myself, and that I was unworthy. These messages were not helpful. In time, I realized that my anxieties were caused by these two sources: a faulty view of myself and a lack of confidence about my abilities. In the end all of my anxiety could be traced back to this single flaw which I had never addressed. In time I learned the difference between confidence and insecurity. A confidence based on success in life and love, is self-reinforcing. If the confidence is not self-reinforcing, the anxiety will remain, and it will continue to eat at us.


In the past few decades we have seen an increasing demand for information on the origins of anxiety and its treatments, and of course with the advent of the internet, we have an ever expanding range of available knowledge. We are also seeing an increase in the number of self-help books, seminars, and self-help gurus. There are now an abundance of books (mainly self-help guides) and there are seminars and workshops. It seems that anxiety has become a big business. I would suggest that the growth of anxiety is being fueled by a fear of growing old, being lonely, and being unappetizing. In his book Why Men Fail, Malcolm Gladwell notes how anxiety and self-defeating thoughts have traditionally been addressed by people that are on the fringes of society. Gladwell calls these people, "the weak-minded" and they are more concerned with appearing weak and being in the minority. These weak-minded people have been identified by Gladwell as, "the weak-voiced." What this means is that the weak-voiced person believes he is smarter than others and thus he tries to stand out.

The most dangerous weak voice is the weak-voiced person who is so confident that he is too confident. A strong-voiced man is less concerned with being seen by others as powerful, and more concerned about being in control

The American Bar Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges today issued statements urging public health officials to prohibit the importation of imported Kratom after its DEA administrator announced its scheduling.

Kratom was introduced to the United States in the late 1980s as a traditional "indigenous product" that is used in Southeast Asia as an herbal remedy to control opioid withdrawals. However, this was a misnomer since the botanical leaves contained no opioid-like activity. Since its appearance in the U.S. market, the herbal supplement has become increasingly embraced by consumers looking for alternatives to prescription opioids.

The American Pharmacists Association has stated that there is no evidence to support that Kratom products present an unreasonable risk to users or others around them. The AMA and AAMC have long advocated for a thoughtful, evidence-based approach to the legal classification of the herbal supplement.

The following is a statement from the ABA and AAMC on the matter:

"The decision by the U.S. DEA to include kratom as a Schedule 1 substance is an unfortunate development and, by extension, represents an unnecessary infringement on the individual freedoms of citizens. The U.S. Attorney General's decision to seek a temporary injunction against the importation of kratom from Indonesia and Thailand is wholly inappropriate, and the DEA should refrain from taking similar action in the future.

"Kratom has been used throughout history to treat many conditions and, if responsibly researched, potentially has tremendous benefits as a medical treatment option. Unfortunately, that promise has been overshadowed by claims by some proponents and in the media that kratom is somehow harmful or addictive and an imminent public health crisis. These claims have been consistently rejected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and all other credible scientific studies, including a recent review of kratom's status published in the journal Addictive Behaviors."

The lawsuit marks the first time the FBI has weighed in on the growing torrent community, and also serves as a reminder that many people in the torrent community are also copyright pirates.


In a complaint filed on Friday, Rightscorp, which makes its money by tracking down suspected pirates, claims that KickassTorrents has been using the BitTorrent protocol to distribute thousands of copyrighted films to its users.


The company believes the torrent site is using the BitTorrent protocol to distribute films illegally, and that its servers contain copies of hundreds of thousands of pirated movies, TV shows, and songs.

Specifically, Rightscorp says that at the height of the torrent site's activity, in January, it "determined that 1,056,832 torrent files containing thousands of copyrighted movies, TV shows, and music tracks were being delivered across the KickassTorrents network."

Rightscorp's claims are based mostly on a comparison of BitTorrent traffic at the time the complaint was filed, and estimates of a total size of the traffic using an estimated BitTorrent client. Rightscorp was able to confirm that the KickassTorrents network delivered 7.4 billion torrents.

The company went on to say that KickassTorrents' servers contained copies of millions of movies, TV shows, and music tracks.


"[It] appears that the KickassTorrents network was primarily targeted for distribution to the public, and specifically, was not targeted toward the particular IP addresses for whom the KickassTorrents network was built in this case," Rightscorp said.

KickassTorrents has not yet commented.<|endoftext|>The New York Red Bulls (6-3-3, 26 points) are set to travel to Columbus (5-3-4, 17 points) this coming Saturday at 9 p.m. The match will be televised on Lifetime at 8:30 p

What Is It Like To Live Inside A Big Screen?

By Matt Stoller | Industry | June 19, 2012 |

You've probably seen it a million times by now: a group of people huddled around a big screen. It's their only entertainment. But what's it like inside that big screen? The New York City subway is lined with theaters, and some of them can actually be more fun to hang out in than some of the bars and clubs of the city.


It helps if they're built in historic buildings, but the best ones are in buildings that look like they were built on a beach—that look like buildings everyone's had an argument with. Think of them like an extended outdoor play area, or something between a big-screen theatre and a bar.

On this list we're looking at some of the most exciting theaters in New York City. You'll probably find your own favorite, so put your suggestions in the comments.

*Note: This list is sorted in order of my favorite thing to do on the subway, which is always pretty fun.

Theaters

Grand Central Market

Grand Central Market, New York (Grand Central Station)

We're not sure exactly how they got on our list, but that's probably the most fun movie I've seen (or a close second).

The building is filled with giant food carts, the largest one of which might actually be too small to fit on that big screen.

We also get a few cool locations in the basement, which was probably the largest part of the restaurant the theater was built into.

Museum of the Moving Image, NYC

New York Museum of the Moving Image

It's difficult to pick a favorite. The museum looks so great and is packed with unique films (including those starring Tom Hanks).

The museum has an incredible rotating screen, but it's a bit of a dive, which means it can be hard to keep up with the movies being shown. But once you're there? You'll be like 'why didn't we all do this earlier??'

Union Square

Union Square (Union Square Park's west side)

It's kind of magical to be on the lower level of a theater—which is where you'll find more free popcorn (seriously!), so much more free hot dogs (seriously!), AND a bunch of free popcorn.

There's a giant screen and a stage. The stage, by the way, is actually the second longest stage in the museum. The larger one of the two, which is located in front of the main building, is much lower, as I said.

Grand Opera House, Chelsea

Grand Opera House

I just love the feel of that building–there's just nothing better than taking a train through an opera house! You can walk around on an enclosed balcony or climb the big screen.

But the best part of taking in a performance is when it's time to leave for the next one: there's a parking lot outside. People on subway cars would just hop in their cars and do the same thing. It's awesome.

MoMA PS1, Chelsea

MoMa PS1

That would be the MoMA's beautiful large screen, which is located near the lobby.

The PS1 stands alone in the theater, which makes walking through it a little confusing…until you realize that it's kind of a weird way to view live theatre. But hey: you can sit on the stairs!

Rockefeller

Rockefeller Center

The lobby and lobby area of the Rockefeller Center is filled with a lot of the same types of businesses that you see in other large parks like the Metropolitan Park or Central Park. They also show a lot of movies on flat screens, all of them are good for a walk around…and also make it easy to find where you are–just walk north on 42nd St.

A number of the theaters on this list will be opening new movie theaters later this year or early next year—so check in each time we update this list to see what movies may be playing.<|endoftext|>Trevor

The latest in a long series of lawsuits against the Empire State Building that has been pending since 1993, has now resulted in a $10 million payout to a homeless couple.

Joseph Andres and his girlfriend, Barbara Ann Zabinsky, were living on the building's upper levels and said they got into a fight with an NYPD officer, resulting when the officer used a baton to stun Andres and a broken cigarette lighter to stun Zabinsky.

The lawsuit claimed that at no point before the first, and then second, baton strike that ended with Andres in the hospital and Zabinsky in the bed had Andres or anyone else ever approached them and asked for help.

In response, Empire State Building said in a statement Thursday it had settled with them to avoid all litigation, according to WCBS-TV.

The settlement, which the couple must pay themselves, is part of a "significant payout" to homeless people "who have endured years of frustration and hardship, both physically and psychologically," according to a legal filing from the Empire State Building's lawyers.

A spokesman for the Empire State Building did not return calls or emails Friday.<|endoftext|>There are some areas in your neighborhood that you would not think are bad, but that could have a significant impact on your health. There are some streets in the city where you would probably never want to have a baby. You might not even care if you had one, but it's just something you just don't think twice about.

Here's just a little taste:

The 20 Worst Roads in NYC

According to the City Planning Department, most of these streets are in poorer neighborhoods, as opposed to some of the safer avenues that most of us take every day - like the FDR Drive in SoHo, the I-90 Belt in Brooklyn or The LIE in Williamsburg.

And it turns out, not only are these streets bad for you, but they impact more than just your family and your life and your safety on the road - the neighborhoods around them. Many of these streets are also bad for property values.

The City Planning Department analyzed the 20 worst roads that pass through our neighborhoods and determined that all of these roads have been rated "poor" or "moderate to poor."

Some have even been awarded the "poor" rating, which means that it's "the weakest links in the safety architecture of neighborhoods and the most vulnerable areas around the roads."

What's worse is that some of these streets are in areas where the residents are already experiencing higher crime rates than other areas. And while the roads themselves are poor, the residents who live in them might not be!

What's your view of these roads? Which should you try, which should you not? Let us know in the comments section!

The new species and its DNA was found inside one of the smallest, and possibly oldest, organisms known – the fungus Agaricus blazei.

Scientists call it a new genus, and they think they have identified the DNA of around 80 species of plant-like fungi.

"I think that we've probably seen the beginning of something really special," lead researchers James F. Delaney, from the University of Pennsylvania, told the BBC. Delaney and his colleagues have published the findings, which they said would require a "massive amount of work" to analyze further.

Agaricus blazei is considered one of the first cases of its kind, so there's no known species in that genus. They were able to figure out what species they were looking at thanks to a combination of genetic testing techniques and DNA analysis.

"We're not going to know, we don't know, until somebody takes a stab at looking at the genome of this organism one more time with a more powerful technique," Delaney said, but noted that "one thing that is certain is that there is something new in the picture."

It's unlikely that the new species will pose a threat to a human, but Delaney's team believes it could potentially be an environmental pest, which could eventually be controlled using traditional fungicide.

The researchers are planning future genetic analysis of the new species' DNA, in order to better understand what exactly it does and which traits it has, in hopes of using them for new tools.<|endoftext|>SINGAPORE - The National Environment Agency (NAO) has denied a request by an environmental conservation group for a report which could have provided evidence of the impact on marine life of the construction of the $1.7 billion East Coast Pipeline (ECP).

The poll, conducted between October 19 and 24 by Health Care for America Now and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, reveals that nearly half don't intend to keep an Obamacare policy for the rest of their lives — if they do, they're unlikely to sign up for an Obamacare policy next year.

In case you don't fully grasp that figure, I've put together a short graph to summarize the top-line findings of the survey. (In case the visual doesn't make it clear, those are "insurance policies" and not "health insurance," or perhaps not even "insurance." My bad.)

As the chart demonstrates, roughly one in five voters (21%) said they had decided not to renew their Obamacare policies from 2014 — meaning that about 8 percent of the U.S. population have found a way to find an alternative health insurance policy that works for them this year and next. One in six voters (21 percent) have no plans to renew and, by extension, have lost this insurance coverage.

While these results could point to continued opposition within Congress to the Affordable Care Act — the survey shows that "one in three Republicans are not familiar with the law" — at least one thing is clear: A decent chunk of the American population are finding a way to avoid Obamacare.

How do you feel about Obamacare's enrollment?<|endoftext|>Still loading...

How much do you want to know?

The other day, I was talking to someone who worked in media. I talked about the history and implications of the term 'sexist' and how it had grown out of the original anti-feminist backlash (I wrote about this in more detail in my Gender Wars book). They said:

"Sexism has always existed, for as long as there have been male and female roles. The problem with feminism is that it is focused on destroying gender roles. It is the problem of men trying to control women."

The phrase 'the other side of the fence' comes to mind. But what do I mean by this? I'm not talking about being on our other side, as some people have suggested. I'm talking about how we talk about the issues of sexism in popular culture and in the broader social landscape.

I've noticed how much we focus on the female perspective, even though we are still dominated by women in the workplace and in social relationships. So often, we're accused of sexist bias. We're accused of perpetuating sexism when we talk about women being more 'emotional' or "neurotic," even when we're saying things like: a) we have to work harder, b) we have to talk a lot, c) we're less intelligent than men. It's the same thing as blaming men for 'mansplaining' or 'mansplaining.' I've experienced this too – I was accused of sexism when I criticized a popular TV character for being a 'damsel in distress.'

And of course, there are plenty of very negative things said about men who are angry, aggressive, dominant, etc. But of course, men are also accused of that stuff too.

So what's the real question: how would you describe yourself?

What would you say we do wrong?

If we're doing it wrong, then let's talk about it.

The National Security Agency has the authority and the means to access your private Internet traffic as well as the communications from your phone calls and Web surfing. How to protect yourself?

There are four basic steps in protecting yourself against surveillance:

1. Never give out your personal password

While there may be a time or place to divulge the password, this isn't one of them.

Don't share passwords with your friends or anyone other than the person who needs them.

2. Keep encrypted files (mail or web)

Your email and web traffic aren't private – not if you're using the encryption technologies built into the programs that protect you.

Encrypting your files is easy, safe, and secure. Encryption is how you protect your most sensitive files, such as your financial and medical records and even your children's personal information.

3. Use encrypted emails (e.g., PGP)

The popular email encryption software, PGP, is easy to use and will help you keep your data private. Even if someone gains access to your email account, they will not be able to read it, even by brute force.

To learn how to use PGP, check out this guide.

4. Enable VPN for encrypted communications

As far as Internet traffic goes, encryption is the only way to go. But don't just rely on VPN services to provide this – many private Internet networks that you'll find through search engines or social networking sites have end-to-end encrypted communications in place.

How to enable VPN for private network communications

The easiest way to see how the Internet works is to use one of these VPNs:

A few VPN providers allow you to use their service without registering on the website, without registering your email address in the database, and without requiring anyone to be online during the duration of the session. Check out these VPN providers and how they handle the data they maintain about you.

While we strongly encourage you to do the research necessary to protect your privacy, you can protect yourself without doing any research.

Your Internet Service Provider can help you encrypt your home, work, and social media, and even your mobile devices. Check out our guide to encrypting your computers.<|endoftext|>Papachristus Papachristus

Common Name: Papachristus Common Name: Papachristus

Papachristus, like most birds, is covered in feathers. However, Papachristus does have a few differences to its relatives. For one, it is the only other bird in the world named after a Roman Emperor: Emperor Maximilian.

Papachristus is a medium sized bird with a stout head, long feathers and a pair of heavy front legs. Its plumage is dark brown on the breast and wing tips, light brown along the back and yellow on the breast. The bill is brown with dark red tips.

The male, or larger, and female, or smaller, members of this species are quite similar. Although only a few of the species have been observed in captivity, both members of the species have similar vocalizations and territorial displays and are relatively easy to domesticate.

There have not been nearly as many species discovered as there have been records made of a few common Papachristus species. Most of these have been known from living populations of captive birds. Thus, no information is available concerning this bird's genetic diversity.

A good place to start is to read some descriptions about the species from birders of the last ten years.

Biology: Papachristus is a tropical species of Old World finch. However, populations are found to varying extents in North America, South America, China, and Australia.

Its distribution is restricted to an area of roughly 50,000 square kilometers. Most of Papachristus' wintering areas are in South America. Its breeding range is the Indian Ocean.

This bird is an immigrant to North America, a migratory bird. Although migratory birds can go on to breed anywhere in the world, migratory species tend to be most often seen with the exception of the avifauna from Europe and Australia.

This species is not known to be a breeding bird of humans, or other warm-blooded animals.

In the wild, Papachristus will often fly from one perch to another, often to a place where they can find a place to roost. They also feed on a wide variety of plants of the genus Pyrus.

The wing membrane of this bird is composed of two membranes that are intertwined and connect to the bird's feet. The two membranes are attached to the feet by an elaborate system, composed of a flexible webbing of fine fibers called filaments.

Male Papachristus are known from the southern parts of North America, from British Columbia, to the Florida Keys and southern Texas,

In the coming weeks, many people expect a new episode of the American health care conversation to hit an iceberg in this country. President Trump and congressional Republicans have announced a new version of Obamacare they say will bring down costs. The latest version was introduced in the Senate a couple weeks ago and is still not a bill yet. Democrats have already said they would block any such bill.

But a number of the most important factors in the creation of Obamacare — premiums, deductibles, cost-sharing assistance, coverage requirements — have been in place since 2010 and could continue well beyond 2017. (That does not mean that the new plan will be great; it is not.) But there are some big changes expected, ones that would greatly affect both consumers and insurers. Here's a list:

1) Premiums

Obamacare's premium hikes are already happening. A group of 13 health care analysts that includes four Republican and four Democratic analysts found that the average "silver" premium for a midsize group plan (that is, a plan with around 100 enrollees) will increase by 20 percent next year, compared with this year.

Another group of researchers found that premiums will rise another 6–12 percent on average in 2018. Even if you only look at the individual market, premiums will rise an average of 20–24 percent compared with 2017. And insurers have already been cutting back on their generosity, as the New York Times's Robert Pear reported in December. Some insurers have begun canceling plans that cost more than 8 percent of employees' income, according to Robert Laszewski, author of a blog called Healthcare Marketplace Watch.

A handful of states that set their own premium rates have found their exchanges are facing more instability than expected, and they're still working out how to get the federal funds they need to keep paying subsidies without going broke.

2) Co-pays and deductibles

Co-pays and deductibles, though, were always a part of the original plan. The original health care law (and, for that matter, the tax policy plan of the 1990s) included provisions to reduce out-of-pocket health spending.

But while Obamacare made some headway last year, most people are still paying way too much of their medical bills out of pocket to be "affordable." The average deductible for an individual plan last year was about $5,000 — in 2015, that cost $17,000.

In a 2014 paper for JGR, Jeffrey Young found that there are many ways for insurance companies to reduce the impact of medical costs on patients, such as "contributions by patients and employers" and "the use of the financial risk-sharing mechanism that is intended to encourage patients to adopt preventive care, save for their medical care expenses, and reduce the need to engage in high-cost emergency care activities."

Coinsurance plans, designed to prevent high-cost patients from being billed too much for treatment, have been popular among consumers. But they also make it harder for people to get the coverage they need, according to a 2015 study from the Commonwealth Fund, a Boston–based nonprofit organization that funds research on health care costs and outcomes.

The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to how insurance companies assess medical needs and their ability to reduce coverage expenses. This has contributed to lower-than-expected rates of co-payments: In 2014, for example, 64 percent of insurers said they had lower co-pays compared with a year before, according to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services report. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also published a survey of insurance companies earlier this year that showed that they were expecting about 70 percent fewer enrollees this year, partly as a result of the new "essential health benefits" rules — for example, that health care covered by an insurer must include "hospitalization, emergency services, physician services … and hospice care." (Some health policy experts worry that limiting benefits could result in insurers hiking the costs of the plans to cover them.)

But insurance companies are already pushing back, as I discussed in an earlier post. "We do know there are going to be significant challenges," says Charles Gaba, senior fellow at the Century Foundation. "But the administration is really getting its feet wet on the Obamacare regulatory agenda right now, and we're just waiting and watching to see where it goes."

3) Co-pays and deductibles seem more generous

This was a big goal for proponents of the Affordable Care Act. They wanted to give consumers more money to spend on their medical needs and keep insurance more affordable for consumers. Unfortunately, as we have written before, some consumers who have to pay so much out of pocket simply do not pay it. In 2014, after reviewing data on premiums and deductibles across the 50 states, the Commonwealth Fund found that on average, Americans paid $2,532 for their medical bills in 2014, with co-pays and deductibles averaging $2,160.

As a kid I never knew of the "T" in the word Tramp, but as someone who came of age in the '50s, I'm glad I did. It's a word that tells us that, at the very least, the Tramp was a man who didn't shy away from hard work and risk.

The word can come from two different sources. First, in the words of Merriam-Webster, the name is derived from "Transylvania," a region in southern Romania. The town is named after the nobleman who settled there, so perhaps the Tramp was a man who came from Transylvania, or who had spent time there (or was related to those who had).

More likely the origin is the word Trombe, meaning "a man or boy who has worked, traveled through or lived in some frontier district" or a boy who was a "tramp or runaway."

There is, then, a strong connection to Transylvania. A common theme in T-roll story are the poor, wandering T-rolls who traveled to and lived in the wilds of Transylvania. The Tramp fits well with these motifs, and as the stories developed he came to be known as a hero that crossed borders both on foot and by horse.

What makes the Tramp so iconic, though, is also what makes him so misunderstood. In the first place, there is no connection between the Tramp and "Trombe." Trombe was a man who "trafficked" for money, not for anything else, not even for pleasure. He was more like a traveling salesman. He went from village to village. You could call him a trader who traveled for gold. In fact, one of his most famous poems is about buying and selling gold. Here's a little excerpt, though, from one of his poems called "The Golden Goose":

I had just come back from Transylvania,

Where I'd bought gold for twenty pieces,

Two pieces from each peasant I sold

But now for gold I come to find

Four pieces to me.

Tobacco pipes and bags of grain

And gold in the pockets are not the Tramp's

Reason for being.

The Tramp may be a traveler, and his journey is in part a quest for his own personal gain, but he still has a heart of gold and a sense of honor, despite the dangers he faces. In his stories, he travels throughout Europe and even the Middle East, and he doesn't care what his destination is—he just wants to get back on his feet. He's a man who doesn't try to live a luxurious life, and who isn't ashamed to be poor (though it's not clear as to what his income was as a kid).

In fact, the Tramp may be a bit less wealthy than he appears, and he may not have had the greatest means of transportation in his youth. The author of "The Golden Goose" tells us that he got the idea for the poem from a story told by a traveling salesman. The salesman had gotten lost in a forest, and was afraid, when he realized he couldn't find his way back into town, that he would never be seen again. He would be a lost man, and he would die a lonely death. When asked where he would die, the salesman replied that he wouldn't die; he would just give up. (His words, not mine.)

There's more to the story, of course. What the salesman didn't tell the traveler was that he had made it to the small town of Bracken, near Bristol, during the last days of the Roman Empire, where he lived and worked in a tavern, and later, lived in a manor there. And, while the shopkeeping skills he learned in his travels are evident in his work, he couldn't have been poor for long; he had a wife and a farm and a stable. The Tramp may not have had the money, but he's not a "tramp" as such. He doesn't try to live a luxurious life: he just doesn't live so lavishly that he can't keep up with the cost of buying all the food he eats and all the money he travels with—and with his daughter and son.

By most accounts, he was about twenty-four when he left home and went off on his travels—though we all know that was before the invention of cars and the telegraph and the telephone with which to relay messages across the world. He might have even died during his travels. His daughter eventually remarried, and it is rumored that her new husband, who lived in the area as a soldier during the war, might be the one to discover and bury his father in Transylvania. And it is rumoured that when the T-roll's

John Stossel

When something is worth saving–anything–you will struggle to live without it. This is because for humans all valuable properties are inherently valuable. The difference is, for a human to possess something that's worth saving–anything–it must be scarce. In other words, there must be something you can't have. So the value of whatever's being saved must be proportional to its scarcity.

Now suppose an interesting man named John Stossel tells you that saving money is more valuable than your wife's happiness. He's a wise, interesting guy, and he says that saving is more important than your wife's happiness. What do you do?

Of course you save, because that's what John Stossel recommends. You're an intellectual. That's what you do. The only way you can not save is if your wife is worth more to you than your wife.

So John Stossel is telling you, "You can lose a wife, but you can't lose

New Delhi, May 26: An FIR has been registered against an anti-racket agent in a case of kidnapping of a former Congress minister and her family members.

The FIR was lodged by Nupur Sharma, the former secretary general of the Congress and the wife of Subhash Sharma, the son of Congress leader and former Law minister Jairam Ramesh Sharma.

The FIR was lodged under sections 498A, 498-A, and section 66 of the IPC at the Sadar Bazar police station in New Delhi, on May 26. Police said an FIR has been filed against Subhash Sharma under provisions of the IPC's stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences.

The complaint dated 28 April claimed that former Congress minister Sarbjeet Kumar Sheek and her family members were abducted on the way to visit their office in New Delhi at approximately 2:30 am on the morning of April 28. The complaint named the two accused, Nupur Sharma and Sarbanand Sharma, as accused. The complaint stated that Nupur Sharma was accompanied by her brother and another family member.

The complaint alleged that Sarbanand Sharma and Nupoor took Sarbjeet Sharma to a secluded place with a man named Rustom Samaali and forced her to withdraw money from a bank before abducting her. "Sarbanand threatened to take both of them to the district court for lodging of complaints. Sarbanand used the same ruse several times," the complaint stated, adding that Nupur Sharma returned home in the evening following the incident and narrated the incident to her family members.

The FIR was registered on the basis of the complaint received by Sarbanand Sharma, police said. The police said that Sarbanand Sharma had earlier approached the police department seeking their help in preventing Sarbjeet Sheek from leaving the country.

For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App<|endoftext|>A new report reveals that the city of Chicago will have to cover $150 million in additional legal expenses in order to compensate for the loss of $1.25 billion in revenue as a result of the long wait times that victims of police misconduct endured at the city's public defender system.

The Chicago Tribune reported that the city will have to add another $150 million to cover the lost payments, and Chicago Public Schools will have to pay for another $500 million in extra defense costs, bringing the total to $400 million.

The city's court costs and litigation costs could cost the city more than $10 million a day if the investigation and settlement is not concluded by the month's end.

In order to cover the additional funds the city is seeking, it will not be subject to bond increases. Instead, the city plans to go with an increased use of a combination of cash and borrowing for the cost of the investigation in order to avoid having to sell city assets.

The investigation comes as a result of a damning 2015 report from the department's own Inspector General, who cited repeated failures by the city's public defender, who was accused of covering up and failing to investigate sexual assaults and robberies by members of the Chicago Police Department.

"While the attorney general, the city's inspector general and a wide range of experts have noted the systemic deficiencies in the [Chicago public defender's] system, the CPD officers' misconduct and cover-up continue to go largely unchecked," the report said after it was written.

The report found that the Chicago Police Department, which is a wholly owned division of the Chicago Public Defender's office that was created in 2002, fails to "adhere to established procedure and law" and "is subject to a wide range of procedural violations that can be directly attributed to inadequate supervision."

The report detailed how the Chicago Police Department was "unable to effectively discipline the officers for their misconduct," instead citing misconduct by officers in a "number of other cases."

The office that oversees the attorney who handles cases with Chicago police is required to send its investigation results and recommended action to the city, where officials must act on such findings, "when they find that city employees have failed to provide appropriate due process to alleged victims."

After the report was written, the city turned to its inspector general at the request of Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez.

The police officers who were accused of covering-up the crimes were identified by the Chicago Tribune through a Freedom of Information Act request, where it found that a total 15 officers were accused of failing to report to police reports of crimes in which they were actually part of the investigating team.

Five officers were accused of withholding reports altogether, with reports that alleged multiple rapes from incidents in the days before Christmas and more than a dozen attempted attacks that occurred on the morning of Jan. 2, 2015.

The Chicago Police Department said that, with the exception of an officer who violated department rules, no officer has been disciplined over the cover-up and that it

The "Hooking Up in the Back," a column about a hookup culture that's out of hand in today's hookup culture, is a popular column from many a young writer. It can be an eye-opening glimpse into a young man's inner life and a refreshing read for people who are tired of the same old stories. If it is like most other "Hooking Up in the Back" columns, it contains what are deemed "unhealthy" and often "unworthy" stories of hookup culture. We're going to do the same, but to a different audience.

A "Hooking Up in the Back" column, in part, is a piece of art that needs to be heard and shared by someone with the audience, because it takes a lot of time and sometimes money to make art that everyone gets to hear. We are here to do two things: show you our art and give you the truth.

We don't just want to tell you how to get laid. We want to talk about why you're in the same boat and let you in on one of the biggest lies your friends tell you about sex and hooking up.

Here's that truth:

Hooking Up in the Back: A lot of women have a good idea where the fun begins, because it's at a club.

Well, yeah, a certain portion of young men will hook up at a club, but as long as some guys aren't going to a club to hang out and get to know these women, it shouldn't be too hard to find some women you'll like. The truth is, there are some clubs that women just aren't feeling at at this point, but that also doesn't make them any less of a good place to try to meet those women if you want to. As we said, there's no reason for these places to be bad at this particular time.

Hooking Up in the Back: Guys who go to one club to find that one woman aren't actually looking to meet a lot more women and are looking for what we call the "fun," because they expect to meet some hot and horny girl.

Again, we're not telling you that the club scene is full of men in their 20s who are getting together just because that's what they were born to do. These are guys who have a lot to learn when it comes to hooking up, and they just aren't aware of what makes the club scene different from the other places they might be at that night. If they were, they'd be looking for a different type of hookup. We're telling you there is, indeed, a "fun."

Hooking Up in the Back: There's no single reason why the club scene is so bad at this particular time of night.

There are so many reasons that hooking up in a club won't work for you, but here's what really does.

It doesn't matter where you go to get women anymore. If your girlfriend is already in the club, a place where she's hanging out anyway, you won't stand out as a guy who hangs out and makes sure to get a woman there. And once you get a good group of girls together, where they want to be, why not show those ladies your stuff, get some girls to like you, and leave? Not everyone is comfortable in the party scene and it just takes one girl who sees you and likes you to make things better. And guess what? Sometimes you're going to have to be the one to give the girl the attention she needs and the attention that's necessary to make all the bad situations of sex easier for you.

Hooking Up in the Back: Some of these girls are hot! Maybe that's why so many guys go to the same places. Maybe they can't get a girl at the clubs because of their personality!

It doesn't matter. If what you want is not there but if what you want is hot girls, don't worry overmuch about the places where you go to find them. The only way this situation gets better is if you find a hot girl who's ready to like you and then make her yours, and you do all this by yourself. There's just no other way.

Hooking Up in the Back: These girls have nothing to do with you and you have nothing to do with them.

Hooking Up in the Back: They'll still take advantage of you and you will still be a slut.

Okay, so I don't mean to say women who go to clubs have no value other than their looks. Many of them do. As we said, they want to be with the hot guy and he wants them, or she wants to be with the handsome guy and he wants to be with her, and both wants to screw someone else. These women have other goals than hooking up, and the only way for

Eilis O'Doherty made her first appearance for the All-Ireland champions against Kerry in the All-Ireland Senior Football Final at Croke Park yesterday.

Eilis O'Doherty celebrates as she scores for the All-Ireland champions against Kerry in the All-Ireland Senior Football Final at Croke Park yesterday.

The 26-year-old scored twice to become the first and only woman to score for one of the most famous sides in All-Ireland history.

O'Doherty, who is from Letterkenny, was picked to play the game following a lengthy application process in which All-Ireland champions Clare were one of five clubs that entered a bid to keep a woman's name on the All-Ireland team.

Eilis O'Doherty scored twice for Kerry against Donegal in their third All-Ireland senior football final at Croke Park yesterday.

In the women's game, players are not limited to an amateur status. However, the All-Ireland Football Championship, known locally as the All-Ireland, does not recognise women's professional football.

As a result, female professional footballer have played only in women's leagues or the All-Ireland Women's League.

O'Doherty, who last scored for the All-Ireland champions in 2009, has been with the Clare County Academy since she was a ten-year-old and is expected to begin regular team training this week.<|endoftext|>"We know you'll do everything you can to keep our country safe," Mr. Trump said in a brief statement to the audience of roughly 4,400 at the Mar-a-Lago private club. That the White House has taken so long to make its case to support the president underscores the degree to which he is still finding his footing. When he took office, Mr. Trump said he would be a president for all Americans and, in his first month in office, has repeatedly called out the travel ban as hurting minorities, women and veterans in a way that benefited the most powerful and wealthy people in the country.

He has been unusually silent about his team's ties to Russia, although several members have been forced to step back from public roles after their ties to the country were revealed, and others may soon be. But he has refused to disavow either Michael G. Flynn, his former national security adviser, or Paul J. Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman. The two men have also provided White House officials with regular updates about their contacts with Russia, although neither was ever fully corroborated.

"I think you will be very impressed," Mr. Kelly said.

The president's decision to go to Mar-a-Lago for lunch was met with some skepticism by White House officials who believed that he could help his allies by addressing a more intimate event. Some said Mr. Trump could be forced to give more details about whether he had met privately with Russian officials and others in the Oval Office last month. But some Trump supporters said the president's behavior over the past 10 days — a chaotic start to his presidency and his continued insistence that he can't release his tax returns and criticize news organizations — had emboldened the president.<|endoftext|>"There are those who say the United States should pull back from the world because it is becoming a failed state, and they are right," Mr. Obama said at a news conference at the United Nations. "But they are wrong to make the world less safe and to put in jeopardy those values that we cherish around the world. And so for me, the question is this: Are we going to let those who would divide us by our differences lead us to be afraid of the future?"

The president said the United States, the United Nations and the rest of the world would continue to work together. He called for people to unite in opposition to terrorism. "So, let me be very clear. The United States remains committed to the freedom, the justice and the dignity of every person and every community in the Middle East," he told a news conference.

American military officials had for years pushed for an increase in military aid to the United Nations system. American officials, mindful that they had helped fund Iraq and Afghanistan and other countries' wars, sought to shift the burden to the world body to fund its peacekeeping efforts.

Mr. Obama, in his remarks, stressed the limits of American military power — and its limitations, too. "No nation cannot solve the world's problems by itself. And so no nation can do what we have to do alone, no matter how large or strong."

I have heard there are a few people who have heard stories about the "Wisdom of the Ancients" or "The Wisdom of The Ancients" for short. People know of the ancient wisdom and their connection to the gods, but no one really knows what they are. Some are saying this is a story told by God, and others have said it is a way of life for humans. You've got to see this movie and find out what your fellow world citizens believe about the ancient masters.


WARNING TO SPOILERS - This movie is full of deep, dark and powerful messages. Please do not watch this movie if you are not mentally ready for these subjects. If you are willing to take the time to see this movie with eyes open, then this experience is very worthwhile.


The film presents an ancient Greek myth told through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy. He is placed into the world of a normal kid, as a result of the "Wisdom of the Ancients," a secret society and philosophy created in the ancient Greece by the legendary philosopher Plato. Plato's message to the citizens of the world is that there is a way to get out of reality and live a life beyond mortal life.


In one instance, the boy's mother is visited by an old, elderly man, and tells him he must learn about Plato's philosophy. Her grandson then sees a statue depicting Plato. In that vision, the boy's mother says the figure is Plato, and the man tells him if he lives a life of philosophy that he will live a very long life.


On a quest for wisdom, the boy meets Socrates, who is a representative of this ancient school. Socrates guides him to some of the philosophies of the time and teaches the boy the meaning of life. The boy is taken aback by the philosophy, and he begins to change.


He begins to think about the world around him, and why he is in it. Plato sees in him the potential for enlightenment, and asks him to read his book. As the boy reads, he begins to develop a love for truth which would become a key theme throughout the film.


The movie ends with a final scene of the boy reading his book and looking out to see a beautiful day. He then looks up and we see him in a cloud of dust. It's then that we realize the story is not over. This film is full of messages to live in truth and honor each other. This is the most important life lesson the film presents. It has also received the most critical acclaim from film critics.


So if anything the movie does it teaches you to always check your intentions at the door. No one is safe from what is in the shadows. Do the right things and you will always be rewarded.


The Wisdom of the Ancients is a unique movie. It is a movie you cannot forget. It is a movie you must view with fresh eyes. There are too many points of view and ways of thinking and experiencing this story to describe.


The film is beautifully directed and it shows the truth that we have lost since WWII to those who seek it. Even though we have had 50 years to educate ourselves on what the world has gone to, we have lost the ability to know the truth.


It teaches you to live a life of truth and honor that leads to your own ultimate bliss. There is no such thing as a free lunch as you will not be able to have it forever. The movie does not take credit for its ideas or its themes, which I consider it to be one of the best things ever made. It merely offers a powerful message and a story to live by.


The movie is one of the most beautiful pieces I have watched and to be quite honest it is one of the most powerful movies of all time. It is a movie that will change your life, but not for the better.

Lets start by the fact that all other things being equal we should always aim to have as little impact on a system as possible. I.e. the less you have the more you can take. For a starting character, this means you will usually have a minimum of 2-3 things you want in the game.
In most cases you can probably pick something nice and small for your starting area. In my case it's a small house in my starting village of the town of Rovinon.
As you can see I have already put some decorations and items in it so hopefully it will feel like my own little house. This is how you get items in your home.
As you are probably seeing, there are three slots in my home for items.
These items are just the kind that you would probably find on someone else's farm but not actually on your own.
For example for a food stuff I am using a lot, I would pick up wheat, carrots, and wheat flour.
I'm using a lot of cooking items too, like the recipe book for cooking.
Also, if you have your house setup then this would be a good place to use a small chest to store your stuff.
These are just a few examples.
You should now be sure what you want in your house.
Now lets try and see what kind of stuff we can put in there.
So here's an empty food table.
There's nothing in there, you can't put anything in there.
I also want a small chair, so I grabbed a small bed from our crafting table.
As you can see there are some items in there.
They are items that you would find on a farm somewhere. You can buy them from other towns to save money, these items are also called farmable items.
You can find more of those in the game but you have to pay for them (or find them from town)
But we want to put some actual items in there. So I got some buckets and some bottles.
These are kind of cool, you can make your own water. I'll get into that later, but if you use these you can also make your own beer, wine, or tea. Also if you get a new house or something and need more items, you can just go to the same crafting station and add more items.
So to put it back together, its time to put those things in it!
Once you have put all of your things in, it's time to try to move items into your house.
Again, you want to put the item in one or more of the slots, so here it is in the kitchen.
This is the place I would get all of those dishes as I would want to do a lot of cooking on my farm.
Some of these items are a lot like the food table. If you're looking for any of those then you should probably go to your farm right now and make food.
Once you've put all your items into your home then you can go back and forth between your house and a farm. Here it is, my house with the farm.
There's a water well in my house, which isn't very useful. I put it behind the house so I can go right to it when I need water.
If I needed more things like a cooking pot or even barrels, I wouldn't use the kitchen in the house I got it in. I would use my house, then go to a farm and put all of those items in there. This is how you make most of your items, just by moving stuff around from one place to the next.
Now to talk about the crafting table that is at the top right of the screen.
Here is my table with all of the things I've been putting in.
I would use this to make stuff on the farm too, if I needed a cooking pot, and would pick up a new one from the crafting table.
Then, if I needed something more, I could just go back to the crafting table and add more ingredients.
This is how you can do most of your crafting and recipes on your farm. Once you do a lot of it, you start becoming very good at it. This is how crafting items go from starting items to really useful items.
Now that I have a crafting table and items in there, I start trying to put them together.
Here's what it looks like.
Here I am putting in barrels and barrels of things I've already bought from towns.
Then, if I need something, I can grab it from the crafting table and put in the spot that I need it.
After that I put in a barrel for my water well.
Here it is, my farm.
All of the items that you get here you can put anything on, but I would just do all of these with something like the crafting table. You could put in a kitchen or even a dining room or whatever

A very good day today. I did 10 miles of running, my first day of exercise in a year. Then I went on a trip with a group of friends at the lake with a lake view. It was a blast. The only problem is, I got to go a little too far away. The park is about an hour from where I live. But it was my first time ever going camping with friends and we all had a good time. 
My new friends and I had a good time.  A little hard to keep out of my eyes. 
The water is blue!
I'm glad I went. I think it's important to get out and explore things. It's a big country.

With the Quick Settings, you will still have to unlock your phone, open your home screen and hit the Google Now button to turn these options on and off though. Instead of doing all of that, the quick settings menu will be on your dialer.

You can add new shortcuts to your menu, but unfortunately you can't remove an existing shortcut. You can also customize the way each button looks, or even turn it off completely for those occasions when the button is not on display at all.

According to the official Nexus Wiki, the feature will be appearing on the Google Search app from tomorrow. Google is currently testing the feature and a release appears to be a few weeks away. It's likely that this feature won't be making it to your final build of Android, but the developer version of the OS is still rolling out so it's possible that this new method will appear in a future release.

That game may have not gone as planned for the Blackhawks, with defenseman Brent Seabrook dropping the gloves with Zdeno Chara.

According to the Sun-Times, "Seguin's dad had called the Bruins' owner at about 10 p.m. Friday night saying he was concerned about Zdeno's safety after Seabrook, 24, was involved in the scuffle with Chara. In a statement, the Bruins said it has been in contact with Seguin's family."

Seguin was not injured and both players later apologized.

The incident is not the first time Boston and Chicago have had a heated confrontation. Back in 2005, Patrick Kane and David Backes came to blows after a goal was scored on both sides during Game 4 of their first-round playoff series. It did not end well for the Blackhawks and Backes, who was suspended 10 games.<|endoftext|>From WikiFur, the furry encyclopedia.

Biography

When Tsubasa Hanekawa began studying the art of Nihon Bunri Kenkyū in 1942, the former Princess of the Iceberg was offered the position of an experimental pilot in the United States and sent to California to train as an experimental Navy Pilot. When the US Government began to see her training as a threat after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hanekawa was sent back to Japan with a bomb.

When the Japanese government ordered the invasion of the United States in December 1942, Hanekawa returned to the United States with her bomb and joined the military at the newly established Battle School. Hanekawa is the only woman in the entire class of 200 of the Battle School and is the only woman ever inducted into the Navy.

I bought this pen for a $150 pen on Amazon. The pen arrived in a very nice box that includes the pen and converter. What I didn't like was where the shipping label was cut out. I was able to cut the label out with a small knife blade and stick it to the outer cardboard and there's no way to see where the pen was shipped. I don't care for the shipping costs. I did manage to find the original website so I can find a second one and hopefully get a refund, but I'm sure it's already been refunded.

I wrote this post more out of an attempt to inspire the writing world to find a solution for the problem of "writing by hand" versus "writing on a computer." This isn't going to be a long-winded, one-hundred and ten-page rant about why "write by hand" isn't the best tool for just about everybody, like most writers are. This post is just something that I thought would be interesting to people, to try to show that you don't necessarily have have to give up something to give your writing an increased value.

If you're looking at this blog post as more of a sort of "Why do you still believe in writing by hand, anyway?" then please read on.

The simple answer to this question is that, for me, there is no quick or simple answer for any of this, just as there's no quick answer for everything. I'd honestly be happy with writing on just about any writing platform (including electronic ones; in fact, writing on a computer is kind of a bonus for me when I write on a computer) but for me a large part of this comes from my need to be involved in the writing process. When I sit down to write I find myself not only not sitting with a blank page, but also not really caring about what would happen to my story if I never wrote it down, because I don't know. This isn't just something that I have discovered through practice — I've actually found myself not even really caring about what happens to my story at all after I've finished it if I don't finish it. Sometimes I feel like I need to sit and think about what I'm writing, and that feeling of self-concern comes from wanting to know what's going to happen to my story.

I've found that my lack of concern about my story's development because I am in the situation of letting the story happen to me in pieces, each of which I will have to sort myself for as it comes along. In a way I don't even have to sit down and write, I just go with it and let whatever happens to me unfold with me. I do have to sit down and think about what I'm writing and how it fits into a bigger whole of things, and that's something that's difficult for me. I write fast, the stories that I write are short, and my stories are full of details. I find I have to slow down when my story will take forever (or is just boring), because I don't know what's going to happen and I don't have enough knowledge to predict my story's development. I don't have enough time to plan for what's going to happen with everything.

When I'm in the situation where I have a story that I've spent a lot of time thinking about, writing, and planning out, I'm in a situation where I trust myself and my writing ability to deliver a story that can be enjoyed by other people. When I give myself this license to let something come to me because I feel as if the idea I had a while ago is interesting enough to tell other people about, then it turns out to actually be kind of interesting for me as well after I finish it. (For more on this, see "Letting Something Come to Me.")

The idea of writing by hand comes from the fact that I really don't have that much control over my writing or the way the story is going to develop. I don't know how it's going to end, and I'm not doing research to figure it out or figuring things out by feel or trying to "see" how things will turn out after I've had time to sit down and think about it. I can only use the experience I have of sitting down with a blank sheet of paper to give me ideas for my writing, which I then use to figure out how the story will progress before I end up with writing that has a good chance of being enjoyable for people to read. I'm still learning how to write by hand though, so some things
======================================== SAMPLE 423 ========================================
What it does:

This mod adds a single-storey building near the westmost tip of The Rift, just south of the waterfall, with a small courtyard. Inside the building will be an empty shop; inside it will be an NPC who is going to sell the main quest ingredients. If you're playing another quest mod this is NOT the place you are looking for, but it might be useful for other people. It's got a working fireplace, too, just in case it gets too cold (with a few modifications).


This mod doesn't require you to use a quest, it's meant to be a place to sell some stuff and perhaps get your inventory cleared. At this point only the vanilla ingredients for the quest have been added (though more are planned) and the NPC is in a fairly empty way. For now, I'm just showing the shop layout. You will see items stored here, but they will not be loaded by the game if they are NOT in the house.


This mod can be used for a lot of things, but probably the best use is simply for your own home if you're going through the rift and want a little place to store any items that you bring back with you. Or, when you're doing a quest in one of the houses, it will be great for that, because you can have your home there AND you can sell stuff from your main house just down the road. The house is in exactly the same spot and can safely be replaced by any mod of any kind, with or without a quest attached. If the house gets too full, you can move a couple of containers out and add some more stuff that goes along with it.


Note that the NPCs are there for a while. I really doubt you'll see them in the shop after you've bought anything, unless you move some stuff from your main house back into your home on the west side of town.


I'd recommend using this mod with your quest mods just to do some extra stuff for the quest, but if you just want to sell stuff you can do that as well; this is meant to be a temporary place for sale, so all you have to do is get your quest done, walk over here, set it to go open at night and everything will be fine.


Requirements:

--This mod requires Dawnguard, Hearthfire, Dragonborn and the latest version of Skyrim.


--This mod requires you to go to the interior of The Rift and activate it.


--This mod requires you to have an empty storage chest on the ground floor of your home, somewhere near the alchemy and enchanting display. You may skip the alchemy and enchanting display if you wish.


What will you see when you activate the shack?:

Inside the shack there will be a simple but useful shop with one merchant offering basic items. The shop owner will not make any conversation, so don't try to get too close by asking questions like "I'm thinking of taking up brewing in the future... does anyone know somewhere good for me to start?". To the right will be an empty counter with an empty inventory. On the left, in a small enclosed room, will be a table, with stacks of empty bottles. It's just for decoration, of course, and doesn't carry any items. To the right will be an empty bookcase with three random books in it, one of which is an enchanter book. Inside them will be a couple of bottles of a liquid called "potion of clarity", which when used on the NPC "Gale," will clear all of his negative, negative effects while granting him a permanent amount of health. I also added the potion to a safe location (in the basement) after I realized that the NPC didn't have a proper healing shrine near his home.


Also, as a side note, the NPC "Gale" has his own quest, and his quest starts at the exact same place as yours. He is a member of the Dawnguard and has been tasked to take you over to The Rift to find one of the "found souls" before the Dawnguard has a chance to come and take them from you. You will also be working hard against some other Dawnguard members too, who may offer to escort you or even kill you if you don't find the final soul before the Dawnguard. I suggest you kill those two members as well because they both get stuck on the roof and can't leave.


Installation:

Copy the contents of the downloaded archive to your Skyrim data location.


Uninstallation:

Delete the contents of the downloaded archive from your Skyrim data location.


Notes:

-I'm not sure that the location you're using is compatible with this mod. I'm putting a version of the shack that doesn't have the fireplace inside, so if you want to be able to use the fireplace you'll be better off using this mod. I don't think

It's been more than five years since the last movie for Pixar's 'Coco' franchise, but as fans wait for the next installment in the story to be released, the company just announced a special pre-show event for the film.

The event will take place at the Los Angeles Convention Center on Oct. 12 at 12:30 p.m. and will run through Oct. 13. The event will mark the first time at the convention center that fans will be able to see the movie on the big screen as it's officially released in theaters.

The film, which will open in theaters on Nov. 22, will also be screened in Imax theaters (at a cost of $85 per ticket while supplies last) on Oct. 12.

Pixar's Coco: "This dream you've been living was a lie until you learned there's another world out there."

Also announced at the conference was a new teaser trailer for the film that opens above.

"As we head into spring this year there has been a lot of speculation about the next Coco. You can hear Coco's dream-filled message on the song, 'Here We Go Again,' and it's also in the movie. When you meet Carlos and his friends they are really living their dreams too. This dream you've been living was a lie until you learned there's another world out there as Coco tells you about. The film will be rated PG and feature characters of varying ages and genders," explained the company on the blog they released when the teaser was released.

The new teaser trailer for Coco was also teased in the same video promoting the new teaser at Comic-Con.

Pixar's Coco will be followed by Coco 2 on Oct. 17, Coco 3 on Dec. 20, and Coco 4 on Jan. 16, 2019. Disney will release the new films across a whole new wave of films to be released in the next four years.

Coco will open in theaters on Nov. 22, 2018.<|endoftext|>After a year-long absence during which the studio was still exploring new platforms, the first trailer for "Dumbo" returned to theaters on Thursday, thanks to a new home on Netflix.

Universal Pictures released a new version of the film on Netflix, and the trailer's second clip is exactly the same as the one we first saw on YouTube back in January — and it's not bad.

The new clip shows the character Tod-Sodden in the big top of a "Dumbo" carriage house, watching Dumbo from afar as the elephant rides down the street. It's just the latest in a series of new Dumbo trailer clips we've seen since Netflix first announced earlier this year it would be distributing the film, which begins a limited theatrical release on March 31 in the United States.

Also in Netflix's "Dumbo" trailer: a big-hearted and playful dance number from the film's song "Big Song," and a new song from composer Tim Rice; the new and old songs "I'm Dumbo, You're Dumbo, We're Dumbo," "I Dream of Jungle," "I'm in Dumbo," and "This is Dumbo" (all by Rice).

Dumbo, of course, is the magical elephant who flies as if he's on a string. The Disney classic — originally published in 1941 and first released in 1932 as "Alice in Wonderland" — went on to earn nine major Oscar nominations, including one for its songs.<|endoftext|>The latest data on job creation comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides real-time data by state. According to its latest Jobs and Wages Report, released on October 5, the U.S. economy added nearly 3.3 million jobs in September and the unemployment rate fell from 4.7% to 4.6%.


On the state level, there was a slight increase in jobs in the U.S. as a whole, but not many, and that the state with the fastest job growth of all was Hawaii (6.4%), which was followed closely by North Dakota (6.3%) and West Virginia (6.1%).


New York, South Dakota, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Wyoming led all states in terms of average annual employment growth, with New York, South Dakota, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Alaska and Wyoming each growing 4.7%.


The fastest-growing states were: New Hampshire, with an average annual growth of 7.3%; North Dakota, at 6.1%; Wyoming, at 5.3%; Arizona, at 4.9%; Hawaii, at 4.3%; Rhode Island, at 3.4%; Colorado, at 3.2%; Maryland, at 3%; and Michigan, at 2.8%.

By now it's clear that if there is hope for a resolution to the Syria crisis, and for better relations between Israelis and the Palestinians, it will be achieved through compromise on two key issues: Israel's security concerns and Palestine's right of self-determination. There can be no meaningful peace with Iran without resolving these issues.

Yet, at the UN General Assembly, Israel made the bold and seemingly dangerous assertion that it will not recognize Iran as a nuclear state. In doing so it was attempting to isolate and sanction Iran, both diplomatically and politically, to prevent it from obtaining enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon. The US Congress responded to the US threat of economic sanctions by rejecting the Obama administration's request for additional funds for such military action. For Israel, the threat of a military strike by the US, and even Israel's strong political allies in the US Congress, is a clear sign that no one side has the upper hand in the crisis.

On September 28, after the Iranian deal was announced, Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon declared that, regardless of how the UN vote goes, Israel will oppose Iran's membership in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

The Iran deal was announced on July 14, 2014, more than one year before the Israeli announcement. So what purpose, if any, did Ya'alon's declaration serve? At the time, Israel had previously opposed the Iran deal, in part because of the IAEA inspection of military sites that had been established under the 1994 Additional Protocol. Since then, Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear activities, yet Iran remains a target for international sanctions from the United States and Iran.

Ya'alon's statement was further proof that the Israeli government is concerned about Iran's security, not merely security of Israeli citizens—in other words, that Israel is unwilling to accept any deal that would give Tehran a nuclear weapon.

For Israel, the idea of Iran developing a nuclear weapon has become a defining issue. In recent weeks it has been publicly stated that: The Islamic Republic is building a secret uranium enrichment facility of its own to continue enriching uranium for use in nuclear weapons. Israel has also been extremely outspoken in its insistence that the IAEA should have immediate access to Tehran's military sites.

The IAEA is supposed to have access to Iran's military sites upon notification by the IAEA or on the basis of a request by a member of the IAEA board of governors. Yet in response to Israel's threat, on September 25, 2014, the IAEA announced that there had been no request from Israel. The IAEA says this is because the agency's director general, Yukiya Amano, "did not wish to provide the additional information that the Israeli Defence Forces had requested."

The IAEA's official press release does not acknowledge that Israel has a military interest in preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. The press release also does not mention Israel's position that Iran's military facilities have no military value and have no nuclear material stored therein.

Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said: "This deal will enable Iran to become a nuclear threshold state that has unlimited ability to rapidly build and deliver a nuclear weapon." He and other Israeli officials have made other statements claiming that Iran's leaders are bent on acquiring nuclear weapons to help shore up Assad's Assad regime.

For Israel, the "threat" to destroy Iran's leadership in the name of national security, which is the rationale presented by Ya'alon's statement, is absurd.

The United Nations Security Council will review the nuclear deal next week. Israel's government is likely to block the passage of any resolution that would impose sanctions on Iran over the Iranian nuclear deal.

The US-led economic sanctions against Iran, including that on shipping companies, are a major obstacle to any deal between Iran and the P5+1, whose goal is to stop Iran from enriching uranium for a nuclear weapon. The economic sanctions provide the principal leverage over Iran, enabling the US-led international sanctions regime, supported by Europe and Canada, to pressure Iran to limit its nuclear activity.

As a member of the Security Council, the United States could potentially play a role in setting up a new mechanism involving the countries of the world to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. In the meantime, the EU and Canada can continue to sanction shipping to Iran, which has been a major source of funding for the Iranian regime, while the US remains one of the largest providers of oil to Iran's petrochemical industry.

But it is the notion of military options that should trouble the international community. If Israel's warnings about Iran's nuclear program really are true, why would Israel not be able to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?

The Obama administration's diplomatic response to Israel's threat of military action has been to encourage it to accept the terms of the Iran deal, including the limitation of Iran's nuclear program. The United States

A federal judge today rejected a request for preliminary approval in a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against the state over a 2011 law requiring voters to present government-issued photo identification at their polls.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in New Hampshire issued a temporary restraining order halting enforcement of the bill, which the National Rifle Association and other groups have deemed the "photo ID to kill voter fraud" law.

Illston's ruling comes in response to a separate lawsuit brought by the Attorney General's office against Gov. Maggie Hassan over the law. A decision is expected in the case as early as Oct. 6.

Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence counsel Kristen Clarke criticized the federal judge's decision today in a statement sent to Guns.com.

"The Second Amendment is the only amendment under the Constitution that actually protects our fundamental right to keep and bear arms. The Department of Justice should be enforcing these laws," the statement read.

Clarke also called the National Rifle Association's argument "patently frivolous." She said: "This is a classic case of the NRA fighting against their own record. They have long been against any effort to keep guns out of the hands of felons and the mentally ill and now they're trying to fight against efforts to keep guns out of the hands of voters."

A number of legal scholars, organizations, and individuals, though, applauded the judge's ruling.

Dan Stein, president of the pro-permit gun rights group Third Way Education Fund, called Friday's order a "huge victory" for the Second Amendment.

"By blocking the most extreme provisions of this law, the judge ensured the protections for the general public, including voters, the rights of the elderly and voters, and the right to participate in elections without being subject to the threat of intimidation at the polls," Stein said in a statement. "This case demonstrates how the Second Amendment doesn't only protect individual rights, it also ensures that the government cannot prevent the public from exercising its own fundamental rights or basic political participation in the electoral process."

And David Kopel, vice president of the Independence Institute in Denver who has been active on the issue of gun rights, said, "With the ruling, we move one step closer to ensuring that the rights provided by the Second Amendment do not become a mere fiction,"

Hassan said this evening, "This is another victory for my office in our effort to ensure voters feel safe when they exercise their constitutional right to vote."

Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence attorney Stephanie Schriock praised the judge's ruling as another important step in advancing her client's case.

"Judge Illston's decision to block the voter ID law is the latest in a series of rulings by judges across the country that the Department of Justice's attempt to enforce the voter ID law is unconstitutional on its face," she said. "Today's ruling is a welcome development in this fight to safeguard voters from intimidation."


This story originally appeared on Guns.com<|endoftext|>As promised the second of our two-part conversation with David Lynch was a lengthy and deep one. So here are the main points about David Lynch the actor, the director, and his influences.

On working for David Lynch:

"I was on a shoot for a while. That was really cool, because the whole thing with this shoot was that it's a very big dream coming true, so I got to work with David on it. This was my first major directorial gig. So I got to work with a director that I just knew that people would like and appreciate and have a very deep understanding of. And also, this was sort of a very personal thing for him, because he's been wanting to do this very thing. The idea that it would come to life in a kind of wonderful way, you know? That was, I think, what was interesting. I don't really know his motivation, but it was an opportunity for him to kind of play it out.

On shooting the sequence that was originally titled "The Little Prince":

"Well, it was actually called "The Little Prince." You know, because it's a little prince that's getting sucked into a hole in space. But he ended up going down the rabbit hole, and so I had to figure out a way to put the words down. But then when we did that the director of photography said, 'Look, David, would you ever consider taking this out? That's just too long-winded, you know? ' And I was like, "No! This is great! You don't care about me!"

On the idea of a surreal episode:

"I wanted to do a weird episode, because I hadn't quite figured out yet who I was in this world and what I really wanted to do with it, and I wanted to really take what I had done so far and push it and break it apart, just to see what I could build. Because

The first thing to be said is that this book is so incredibly, mind-blowing fun to read. And I mean that, I mean that in the sense that, yes, the author has made a bunch of people go "Oooh" in a very specific way. It all goes back to that first bit about not knowing where to start when asked to describe the book. I could go on and on. But, we'll get there.The second thing is that I'm very interested in the concept, what some folks refer to as "The Golden Age", or what some folks refer to as the time of books or the time of reading as a cultural activity, even more so than I'm interested in how much of it is real. Because again, it's interesting to me to know how some people would react to fictional versions of events, or even real fictional ones. And so in that sense, I find it intriguing to know how people would think about some of this stuff. And it's interesting to me too because I have some opinions, and it wouldn't be an entirely accurate observation to say, "This is how it would be like to be in our time," without knowing how people would behave if they were really in our time.In this way, it's somewhat a bit like playing a role-playing game. (And yes, even if some people like to make that comparison, it does have implications that we're trying to avoid.) Because playing a role-playing game, you're in a world, but you don't necessarily get to pick what happens, because the GM will decide what happens. In the same way, someone could play a fictional game in which they are a character and then go, and they'll probably decide what the character does, and it's up for interpretation by the reader, so I'm not quite sure how it should work, I guess.But, I mean, that's the thing. It's a fun question to ask, because there's going to be people in our time, who probably wouldn't like it if the author of this book just left it at the first page and took her readers on a very fun ride. It's a fun question to ask.And, I mean, you know that first page when she says:So, we have a story about a time in which there was a huge explosion at an ancient cathedral, which is in London. And we have a character named Sophie whose husband and two children are killed in that explosion, and she's basically, basically a basket-case by the end of the second book. The character's name is Lark. And her family has been living in a very large mansion, that used to be the London Basilica, but is now one of London's top landmarks, because it survived the Blitz and still has all kinds of architectural secrets and things, and it's full of historical treasures. Lark is very well-off and educated, and really is very much part of the upper class. She's not a poor person, but she's not very rich either, and it's interesting that she can afford to buy the most expensive cars in London.But her real problem is what she wants, not what everybody wants for the common good. What she wants is that the cathedral building should go back in time, so that the people who were killed there will be in a better position. And she sees this as a kind of historical injustice, because her brother-in-law died and her father was dead, but her husband was alive, and he was still alive. And the reason that he died was because he was a thief, and he was a criminal, and he had killed his wife in cold blood. But she doesn't see that, and she tries to convince the people of the time that this is a moral issue. And, I think that's exactly the way that it feels. It feels like a moral issue, and she's trying to correct wrongs.And, she ends up not making a lot of friends. And, to a certain extent, she also sees it as a personal conflict, just that she has her priorities at odds with what other people need. So, there's a very interesting conflict between what we like to see as personal and what we call for. And that conflict also carries over into the conflict between what Lark wants and how she wants it to be.But it's interesting because in a very interesting way, you know, you can start to see a lot that isn't strictly historical or true to nature, that isn't strictly true, that it's interesting. In that way, it's like a literary novel, and we can be influenced by what people are saying and how they're saying it, and we can put something in our own time, and there's some truth to it that's not really true, but we like to see it as a kind of history or a historical fact or what has happened.And I'm not really even talking about it as historical. It's, sort of

The official website for the upcoming TV anime adaptation of Yuki Saei and Ryoichi Suzuki 's Girls und Panzer manga revealed on Monday that it will begin airing in Japan on TBS, Tokyo MX , and BS11 on April 2.

The anime's staff also revealed the anime's main visual for the first time on Tuesday, along with the anime's theme song "Guren no Yumiya." The website describes the anime:

Koume Tada is just another ordinary high school student -- until she enrolls in the All Japan Girls' Academy, the "school for the elite." There, she finds herself surrounded by like-minded girls who are determined to protect the honor of their school's tankery club.

Tada meets Miho Nishizumi and Aqours during her first day at the academy, and she quickly finds herself caught up in their adventures as the tankery club's ace female pilot! Together with her crew, and in an effort to build relationships with the other girls, she begins to understand the "other side" of the game.

Tada makes her tankery debut during a match against her school's rival Nihon Gakuen Girls High School. However, Tada is soon shocked by the sudden appearance of the "Red Dragon," a gigantic, tank-like alien, that aims to destroy Gakuen and the girls.

The anime will feature the song "Guren no Yumiya," performed by Suzumiya Haruhi ( Nagaru Tanigawa in Love Hina ) and featuring the main voice cast from the series: Yumi Asano as Tada, Maaya Uchida as Miho Nishizumi, Mikako Komatsu as Aqours, and Kana Hanazawa as Akari Nishiwaki. The new PV of the opening theme song single is "Ai no Kaze na Kimi no daisuki (I've Got No Choice)," performed by Asakura Miyuki ( Aoi Bungaku Jikenbo ~Jigoku no Kizuna~ , Shirobako ~Sakebe ni Natta ne!~).

In addition, the official website will begin hosting a character poll in two weeks. Answering the poll will reward those who answer with their favorite character. (All of the characters in the manga are eligible to answer.) Those who answer as Shingo Kurata, the school's "cool and collected" second-year student at first, for example, will get an "Ima Uchuu Nami" (I'm a Uchuu's Friend) T-shirt.

The Girls und Panzer game series is the eighth best-selling game series of 2016 in the United States, according to data from the NPD Group's Entertainment Software & Hardware Survey (via Polygon). The game series launched in 2006 on the PS2 console in Japan, and in 2013 it released for the PSP. Over 1.5 million copies of Girls und Panzer are sold each week for the PSP, the PS3, and their respective consoles, the PS4 and Windows PC.

Suzumoto launched the manga in Square Enix's Monthly Comic Zero-Sum magazine in 2007, and Suu launched the Girls und Panzer: Tag Team!! game series in Square Enix's Betsu-Weekly magazine in 2011. Suuka Kazama 's original manga inspired a television anime series in 2012, and a film adaptation opened in Japan in May 2014. The sequel Girls und Panzer: Dai-Shoga Friends is slated to open in Japan on June 2. Crunchyroll is releasing all three series in North America digitally as they premiere.

The Republican candidates' rhetoric sounds so much like the rhetoric used by the radical Right that it's hard to tell where the line is. On the Right, that line is hard to discern because the language used is so far removed from reality that any person with a modicum of political science knowledge can tell there's a big difference between how the Right sounds and how the Right moves.

Just as the radical-Right uses phrases like "national identity," "ethno-state," "white identity," "anti-Western," "pro-white," "traditionalism," "culture," "family," "country," "patriot," and "Christian moral values," the conservative Right seems to be using a similar set of words. In fact, if you look in certain corners of the conservative movement, you may catch a whiff of the radical Right's rhetoric when you encounter the phrases "culture of life" and "natural law."

It's time to take a closer look. Just a quick look shows that there are real differences between what conservatives say and what extremists on the Right mean. Here are four examples of what conservative people actually say, versus what the radical Right thinks they actually say.

What would be a good time when we would see a major new release from the Linux Mint developer team? There are a thousand or so things, but they all depend on our opinion. Our community always gives us suggestions when it comes to new features that we want to have in our distro, and we are always interested. One thing, however, is certain – it is always time for a new release.

At the moment we have just one beta release that you can find on our website, which comes with Linux Mint 18 "Saraha", a long awaited release that will be announced on April 10 this year.

We've got our hands dirty testing it out for a while now and we think that it's one of the best new versions we have ever had the pleasure to see. And it is not to be missed!

For the next couple of weeks we are going to be discussing about the new features in Linux Mint 18 which, as always, don't require a release candidate.

First of all there is a brand new, elegant new user interface that the developers have been working on for a while now, which they call the Mint desktop. It might have looked familiar to those used to Ubuntu, because the look and function is close to that of the Ubuntu Unity.

The new, elegant interface includes an improved dock, which is very convenient to work in and is pretty easy and seamless to use. The dock has icons for most of your applications, folders and shortcuts that you commonly use often. There is also a settings menu, a search field and a fullscreen panel, which you can always switch to with a keybind. The menu also shows the menu items you may want to use.

The new look and feel is not just a UI update, it also helps with performance, as we can notice the difference it makes on the desktop:

As you can see, the system stays stable and performs well, which is a big step for the overall user experience.

It's not just about aesthetics, though. We have seen some improvements to the Mint login screen, the notifications area of the system and the boot process. Those improvements will probably be the most talked about ones.

Login Screen

As we told you just last month, you can now choose whether to log in with your profile, your display name or your user name. It's better to set it that way, because the profile name is now saved when you log in and can be easily used at any time for future logins.

It's also possible to use a display name whenever you log in, if you prefer, but be aware that if you do so you won't be able to save it in a profile anymore. It just won't be accessible. We don't like it that way and the system is easier to use without it.

The user interface is easier to read and easier to use in general. It is much smoother and easier to navigate over, too.

Notifications Area

The notifications area allows you to see which app or app that is responsible for a certain action. For example, the browser has a hamburger button that you can find there when an email arrives. The interface is very easy to use when you are reading your email and want to jump back or search for other emails.

A new way to search for emails would be through the toolbar, so it doesn't matter which email was sent by which app. The icons are very readable and look great, too.

Boot

When booting into Linux Mint 18 we have found that the system boots faster than we expected it to. We had some problems with the older versions that took longer to load into the first post-Mint boot, but those problems are over. The system simply boots more smoothly in Mint 18, and we haven't experienced any significant problems.

There is even a new way to restart your computer and it's better than it was with other similar systems because the system won't ask you anymore for your password, even through graphical login. We have noticed a little more stability in Linux Mint 18, too.

Overall Impression

What did we think of the Mint 18 release? We felt that the new user interface is a very beautiful and elegant one that you won't find with other distros. It is the perfect way to navigate around and is very easy to use. In addition, it makes the user experience much more pleasant even when doing tasks like searching the internet!

Now, if we take a step back and look at the release itself, the main changes are mostly under the hood. We have been very pleased with the stability of the distribution, and also with the improved performance. We think Linux Mint has finally found its own flavor of stability and is very, very usable, for the regular user.

We are looking forward to testing the final release and will be reporting on its release as soon as it's ready. You can keep track of the development

Citing "concerns about the safety" of the facility, the city's top transportation and infrastructure supervisor and the City Council took no action against the project, which has been under review in this area for years. As part of Wednesday's review, the City Council sent letters to residents of four homes on Biddell Street that will be inundated by the elevated roadway.

As part of an ongoing project to build a new road under the Biddell Street overpass, the city is going to move flood risk assessment from the Department of Public Development to the Waterfront Development Authority.

It's part of a new development plan presented by the city this month, which includes "waterfront facilities, amenities and a high-quality pedestrian and bicycle trail." The City Council adopted the master plan in June.

There are about 11,000 residents who live within a block of Biddell Street, along with a few hundred businesses and restaurants. For the city to move on the project, it would have to find a permanent residence for its "high-cost flood hazard assessment" staff for the next 20 years in the office that now handles flood risk assessment for the city. That's a long time with no end in sight.

Last week, the Planning Commission endorsed the master plan for the Biddell Bridge. City Manager Harry Black told the commission the project was too big a project to get through the planning process without a "seminar."

"I don't know how much the new staff can do in the time that they have," Black said. "We want them to be working with us throughout the planning process. … We want to make sure we have a clear understanding of the full scope of what this will mean."

Black also talked about concerns with the new city manager "not being focused on the waterfront and infrastructure" before the city commission's decision on the master plan for the Biddell Bridge project.

In his letter, Councilman James Gray called for the project to move ahead as the city looks to expand its role in infrastructure development for the waterfront.

"Given the growing concern about the current status, I have requested that the City Council review, and perhaps take further action, when the project moves to the Waterfront Development Authority," he wrote.

Meanwhile, the Planning Commission has issued a notice of its intention to continue to review the project.

The City Council has yet to adopt a resolution on the proposal.<|endoftext|>The idea of a full moon and the effects it has on the economy and the stock market may seem at odds with each other. But a new research review reveals that as the full moon rises each day, people are more likely to buy.

In a paper published in the Journal of Business and Psychology, researchers set out to determine if people were willing to pay more to purchase a moonless Friday, which would have been the day before the lunar period occurred. However, a full moon is not necessary to trigger the effect, and most studies have already shown it occurs when the moon is above the horizon.

The analysis revealed that those who believed there to be moonlight at their home on a moonless day were 3.1 percentage points more likely to purchase than those who thought there were none to begin with. "If you want to increase sales during sales peak time, or at the end of the sale period, the moon will bring out your best sales pitch," the researchers wrote:

People are more willing to purchase if they believe there is moonlight, even when it is cloudy and there is the risk of the effect. This effect is driven not by price or sales of those items that are sold during the pre-lunar pre-sale or sale periods, but rather by purchases of sales-priced merchandise before or during the lunar period. We find the lunar effect occurs more frequently on the night of a full moon, or higher in the sky.

Although the authors note that the full moon effect "may be a psychological placebo" in part, they found it more than once over many studies. On at least two other occasions, when the full moon was below the horizon or obscured by clouds, the effect was not visible at all and didn't appear to have a monetary effect on sales.<|endoftext|>In today's news roundup, The New York Times, CNN and NPR are all reporting on a bombshell report, and the New York Times has published part of it. The report is titled "Donald Trump's Foundation Might Have Breaking Law: Illegal Foreign Donations" and provides a number of damning insights into the history of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

The piece also includes several revelations about Trump's charitable foundation. As we've written extensively about before, Trump's foundation solicited a huge number of contributions from foreign nationals in order to curry favor with his staff and the people he worked with, according to this report.

At the time, the foundation reported only about $1 million in revenue from foreign entities; however, IRS documents obtained

As an active-duty service member, you're free to get an abortion. But that doesn't mean you can do so without a lot of paperwork — and a lot of questions.

The Army's abortion policy requires a medical waiver from the Secretary of the Army in order for women who've been deployed for a period of at least 6 months to terminate a pregnancy or seek a medical deferral. Medical exams, a background check and a request in writing from a female service member's commander are necessary for approval.

The waiver is meant to protect the woman, and not to "fraudulently circumvent the policy," said Capt. Marissa Pazzon, a spokeswoman for the base public affairs office, adding that it's "not required, recommended nor accepted by [the] administration."

The policy's "exceptions exist for situations of life endangerment, where a woman has to be hospitalized to receive care, and where the unborn child may be a danger to her or others or where a pregnancy poses an unacceptable health risk."

Women who seek a medical deferral are only permitted to get one of three abortions: a non-emergency second-trimester abortion, a surgical abortions performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy following a "medically justified and documented fetal anomaly. This exception is specifically tied to life endangerment and not abortion due to threats of domestic violence," the policy says.

The policy also permits female enlistees to get a waiver if they "are undergoing a process for separation from service under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."

The Defense Department will not issue a medical waiver for female service members who've been deployed at least 30 days, according to Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis.

"There are many factors that go into making determinations on medical conditions and waivers... It is not uncommon... [for] an application to come in," he said Thursday.

The Defense Department does not keep statistics on how many women receive waivers or whether the Army is the only branch that allows them.

ABC News learned of the policy and the specific requirements after multiple women shared their stories with the Military Times.

One woman said she became pregnant after she got married, and that she had a difficult time getting a waiver or seeing a doctor.

"I tried a few times, but there was nothing I could do," said the woman, who asked ABC News to remain anonymous.

When she began training for a deployment in November 2016, she had difficulty passing routine physicals. She said she called her unit's medical office for a waiver.

"I remember the lady on the phone looked at me incredulously and said 'are you stupid?'" she said.

She never received a waiver. Another woman told the Military Times she was forced to take pregnancy tests during a deployment.

"When I did, I had to get my blood work done for me and sign an agreement saying, 'I understand that I will not discuss my condition with anyone, nor will I show them any of my medical material,'" she said.

She was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which has symptoms that include weight gain, acne and irregular periods. A medical team, including a gynecologist, diagnosed polycystic ovarian syndrome, the woman said.

In a report that she signed during a medical test, the woman noted her doctor had recommended terminating her pregnancy.

"He was very upset about this pregnancy that was very close to the delivery date," the woman said. "He said it would be best for me to try to manage this and help the pregnancy naturally, as much as possible."

A third woman said she was not able to get a medical medical deferral for her deployment to Germany. She had a "lapse in her medication," and had developed "a really bad infection after the soldier we were going to be serving with in Germany got sick" and died, she said.

"I really had to fight for the waiver," the woman said. "I got a waiver for two months out of six months. I got a medical deferral and it was very difficult. I was in constant stress that it wasn't possible, but I was able to fight for it."

Despite her efforts, her pregnancy was still terminated. She received her discharge because "it didn't work out," she said.

The Army policy also requires women to sign a document acknowledging their pregnancy while deployed.

A woman told the Military Times she'd had three abortions during her military service — each while deployed in a different state.

"I was really upset that my doctor couldn't do anything because we were in a different state and if he would've done something I would've been discharged. I felt really like I was a criminal," she said.

After her first abortion, she "

As with many great stories, a number of them have been told by multiple artists: the great artist Thomas Kinkade, the great artist Ralph Steadman, perhaps even Thomas Doherty and John Harker, if I recall correctly. Today's blog post will try to combine the best of these works into one great video game…or rather, a video game that combines the best of them.

For the game, we wanted to create a story that's accessible to all and one that's entertaining and engaging to most. While it will be a long time until we can see this game in person, and not all aspects will be polished enough until release, there's a lot in place already.

Story

The narrative of The Curse of Monkey Island is based around a group of misfit pirates that fall in love. After a couple years of wandering around the world in their small boat, the three main characters get a ship at the same port. The four of them have their lives become more exciting, each with their unique skills and personalities. As the years go by, many different parts of the story appear. The tale of their relationship, their adventure and ultimately their downfall also play a part in the story, providing more context for what's going on.

We first met the protagonists of the story after they had already taken off their masks, as they would return as pirates on countless occasions until they were eventually banished. They would become the faces of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, and their adventures were a joy to watch. The narrative was often a fantastic mix of comedy, comedy, adventure and action. The humor often came on the backs of a great cast of voice actors, some of whom, such as Tim Curry, have since gone, and some of whom, such as Kevin Conroy, still to this day can be found in movies or video games.

However, with the release of Pirates of the Caribbean 3, the series had come off of it's peak status, and people wanted its characters back. We'd had a good bit of talk with some of the writers from the game on what they wanted to do with the characters, and the characters we wanted to see. It seemed all was well, the team was excited with it's development and then we got the bad news that it was over.

The Curse of Monkey Island features the main characters as a group of misfits trying to escape the evil Monkey King's forces. It is set in 1769 in the Bahamas in the New World, and the main cast (and the game) are set in the village of the Lost Boys. A lot is going on here with this plot line, and each chapter of the tale is divided into acts, such that the story unfolds in sequence. As we start to see more of the story unfold, these acts will become more and more intertwined as the tale unfolds.

The Curse of Monkey Island is a world with an overworld, which serves no purpose other than navigation for the game for the most part. While the overworld is useful, there's a lot of exploration and mystery that can be seen through it. The story takes place on two island (at least for the short times they're on screen), which the main characters travel to and back from quite often. When they arrive, the main character's friends, or their friends of the opposite gender, often ask if they should take off their masks for the day.

There is a great sense of fun inherent in having your friends do this with you. You know you're going to get an awesome reaction when you see it, because you never know if those good willed people in your life can relate. One of your friends can have been the victim of a mugger and someone whose house is currently on fire can call you to tell you that her dog's dead.

The adventure is set in the past and the present of every act. Each act is played out in three different time periods, though they are very likely only seen in the past. Each time period is more of a world in itself as the action takes place on it's own island, and the main characters are seen interacting with it for the first time: the time travel is actually quite subtle at this point. The island has its own set of unique puzzles and puzzles that will challenge you in different ways.

For example, there is a small, yet challenging room that requires a puzzle involving the use of a number to remove a rock, from which comes a small piece of wood. Once placed, a number appears and must be added to the puzzle. There's a simple logic problem that requires someone to place a number into a box before it is taken out, but it also requires you to look through a small hole. It's a puzzle that requires a slight adjustment of logic, but it also requires your thinking and your puzzle solving skills. This puzzle was definitely not for the faint of heart. We really wanted to create a sense of humor and a challenge, which is something we

Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall says a new report from his government and another from an external agency shows the NDP government "lied" when it said the controversial carbon tax would create up to 30,000 jobs before the 2017 election. CBC's Sarah Ritchie reported this morning that the provincial government expects a similar number of jobs from the new carbon levy on all carbon emissions, including industrial polluters.

The NDP ran on a platform that promised to get 300,000 people jobs under tax increases and reduced corporate taxes, but Wall said those numbers were a "misleading" lie, Ritchie reported.

Wall said Thursday's report — from Environment Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency — confirms what his government has said all along, that the carbon levy would lead to at least 30,000 new jobs.

Environment Canada projected the government could lose up to 50,000 jobs, due to the closure of some existing businesses, such as the Regina Freight Corridor. Ritchie reported that Environment Canada also estimated the province's direct GDP would decrease by up to $1.8 billion between 2017 and 2020.

Wall said he wasn't at liberty to discuss details of the study with Ritchie until he was informed the report had been released.

However, it appears the report was not produced to help the NDP sell its legislation, but to inform the legislature and public. Opposition parties have accused the government during question period of not presenting reliable numbers on job creation. NDP leader Cam Broten has claimed the government has released only one-third of the information it needs to defend its carbon tax.

Wall said he was told by the report that he would need the government "to provide a better picture of the net job impacts of the carbon tax than it has provided up to now."

In an emailed statement, Wall acknowledged the report was not produced to help sell the carbon tax, but to inform the legislature and the Saskatchewan public of the job impacts.

"I understand that the findings in the report were developed in light of the current uncertainties surrounding the future costs and impacts as outlined in the government's pre-budget consultation paper. We will work to ensure that information on job impacts is presented in a more transparent and transparent manner in the weeks ahead," the statement read.

During a question period session today, Broten acknowledged, "The estimates were not accurate." But he asked for input to support his claim that the government only has one-third of the information it needs to defend the carbon tax.

"We don't know yet the number of people that will be employed or lost in the industry," Broten said.

Asked to comment about the report, a government spokesperson said no additional estimates will be presented.<|endoftext|>A group of men with their faces painted black and wielding clubs have taken to the streets of Mexico City, setting the city's streets aflame.

The rioting began at the end of last month as protesters tried to block an access point to Tlatelolco, the site of a controversial new highway.

Local television footage showed rioters carrying hammers, baseball bats and bricks through the streets, and at least one person was seen being pelted with rocks.

According to Mexico's Public Security Secretariat, the rioting reportedly began after "unidentified individuals" threw a petrol bomb at a police van.

"I would like to clarify that there was not a single attack against private property," the Secretariat claimed.

"Violence was not unleashed in the Tlatelolco area."

Local police are said to have detained a number of protesters, and reportedly opened fire at one "man in a mask," resulting in the injury of one bystander.

Violence has reportedly spread to other parts of Mexico City since the uprising. Reports say police have been fired upon, their equipment damaged or taken during the unrest.

The government's response has reportedly been to call an "emergency" national federal security meeting, and ask the military to assist.<|endoftext|>The number of children killed or injured by gunfire in New York City declined sharply in 2016 as shootings remained well below the peaks they experienced in previous years, an analysis of police records shows.

What's that? You don't have all day to play with your new Raspberry Pi? Don't worry, it will be there in 15 minutes! You can see more about what Pi does on our website.

But that's not all! If you like playing with computers too, you should also check out this excellent guide on how to use a Raspberry Pi as a wireless access point. It shows you how to connect wireless displays to the Pi for a fully wireless experience, while using the Pi's USB Ethernet to deliver a wireless Internet connection to your local device. It also takes some of the guesswork out of setting up WiFi, since you are pretty much set up all the way from scratch when you are done.

How to build your own wireless Raspberry Pi display

I first learned about this technique from Matt Harvey's guide, and it makes a lot of sense. It makes it much simpler to use the Pi as your wireless display. Just keep in mind that the power source is a battery of some kind, so you'll need to set up a powered USB hub with a 5V hub, and 2A power supply.

This guide will take you step by step through setting up your Pi as a wireless display

This is really exciting to anyone who wants to use their Pi as a wireless display. Just one small box of components can change the way you use your Pi's GPIO pins when you use it as a monitor. This is a great way to get more out of your Pi, and it will come in handy for lots of other projects like Pi Towers, 3D Printers, etc. It's something that I'll be exploring.

If you'd like to build this to do something specific instead, you can download the code and instructions from Github on this page. It's open-source, as far as I'm aware of. You'll also use the Pi-Bot, as I said earlier, which is an awesome project to use it as a wireless display with.<|endoftext|>The most important job in America is at the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI is a monthly index of prices. On a monthly basis, the CPI is calculated by dividing the prices of many commodities (i.e., food, clothing, fuel, etc. and many other items) by the number of people in the U.S. The number of people is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The U.S. national average CPI is compiled from the CPI for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. territories and Puerto Rico, and includes the average cost of a typical basket of foods and services. (For a description of the cost of a typical basket of goods and services, see "Buying the "average American" – the U.S. average cost of consumer goods and services," by S. Daniel Carter, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.)

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average monthly CPI increased 0.2 percent in November from the same month a year ago and was up 0.9 percent from October. On a year-over-year basis, the national CPI increased 1 percent in November and was unchanged in October. At the national level, overall consumer spending remained at a moderate pace in November, rising 0.5 percent from the year-ago level and 0.3 percent from October. Growth was stronger for major spending groups.

The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 1.9 percent in November from the same month last year and was the highest reading on record. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for personal consumption expenditures grew 3.5 percent in November from the same month last year to its highest level since May 2008. The PCE increased 3.1 percent in October and was unchanged from a year earlier. The CPI for prices other than food and energy grew 2.1 percent in November from the previous month. These indices are based on a sample of prices paid by individuals, firms, and farm organizations.

The CPI for all urban consumers rose 2.9 percent in November from the same month last year, exceeding the 2.3 percent rate of increase observed in October, though not as far behind as October. The overall consumer price index increased 3.1 percent in November from the same month last year. The CPI for all urban consumers was up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, and the retail industry index for personal consumption expenditures increased 7.3 percent from a year earlier.

Consumer prices were 2 percent higher in November 2010 than in the same month of 2009. The year-over-year increase in the consumer price index came after two years of declining CPI levels. The year-over-year decrease in inflation was 3.2 percent in November from the same month in 2009.

During 2007, 2008, and 2009, the CPI reached its historical high levels of 4 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. On an annual basis, CPI was 3.1

(NaturalNews) We're going to need more than a little help from Mother Nature on this one. According to a new study published in the journalFood & Chemistry International, corn and soybeans contaminated by pesticide residues can be transformed into extremely potent, but non-toxic drugs, which have the ability to destroy cancer cells, protect against infections and improve the functioning of normal tissue, in just seven days, the BBC reported."These findings indicate that these two foods can be used as a model for developing novel new drugs," said study researcher Dr. Huda El-Ghobi, from the University of Chicago.The two drugs, called dithiothreitol and prochloraz, have the ability to be absorbed by the human body and cause the body's own enzymes to break them down to a chemical form that does not have the same effect. These molecules can be stored in the liver and used in an oral medicine application to inhibit the growth of various cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, pancreatic and liver, a study published in the journal, Food & Chemistry International, indicated."Dithiothreitol may also have an additional beneficial effect, which is that it can be converted to prochloraz using an enzyme, which means the body can then get rid of a toxic substance through excretion, thereby protecting normal tissues as well," said another study in the journal entitled, Advances in Food Science & Technology, that came to the same conclusion."Prochloraz is a very powerful chemical that has a powerful effect on many types of cancer cells and may help fight many types of infections, such as stomach ulcers and diarrhea," said another study published in the journal Food Research International."The study suggests that both these compounds may have a more significant potential role to add to the therapies that are already available in industry and in the clinic. We have seen that these small molecules can be made in large factories that are very efficient," said Dr. Nils E. Skjaerbaek from the department of pharmacology, University of Copenhagen.What makes this even more astonishing is that these chemicals have been known to have potential to fight cancer for over sixty years."There is currently no known therapy for cancer, and so far, there is only one drug that has been made so far that could also be transformed into a metabolite that would be useful for cancer treatment, which is indomethacin," explained Dr. Skjaerbaek.Some experts believe our growing fear and acceptance of food as a weapon against our most vital organ is leading to the next phase of the epidemic, which is where foods that contain powerful antibiotics and natural pesticides are used as weapon.While other chemicals may be used for pest control, these two, as well as the powerful herbicides and insecticides that cause them, are being pushed onto our crops in what is clearly a deliberate attempt to help the very industry that's destroying us.One major chemical compound that's now commonly found in these crops is neonicotinoid insecticides and herbicides, some of which have been banned in the UK for being a danger to our environment and food chain. However, the new study shows that "there is a trend in this direction to introduce new pesticides to food crops in countries like the United States, and this has to be called into question," said Skjaerbaek from the University of Copenhagen, one of the world's leading academic researchers in toxicology.Dr. Skjaerg said that despite this clear evidence to believe it's dangerous to be consuming foods that contain harmful compounds produced by pesticide pollution, we have been duped into buying these products and allowing them to invade our food chain. "People don't realize just how many pesticides they are consuming each and every single day," she said."If you have the right knowledge you can control your own diet to limit or remove as much pesticide contamination in your own food supply as possible, but unfortunately we don't have that now, and even more so due to the fact that we don't know what's being dumped in the food chain," she said.<|endoftext|>Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul join Chris Gardner and Jeff Conaway to play the ultimate game of "Who Let The Dogs Out?" in a game that'll put your favorite shows and movies under the microscope.<|endoftext|>You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters

— State officials are releasing the names and ages of the 15 adults who committed suicide and were reported missing in Orange County last year.

Investigators are also releasing statistics on how people who are missing from Orange County have been handled by law enforcement officers.

Twenty-two people listed as missing from the county were found dead, and three others are still unaccounted for. Of those, 17 were reported missing within 30 days of their disappearance.

Those cases include five cases in which the person was physically located within a month, while the

BENGALURU: In the latest in a string of incidents of violence against Muslim women in Bengaluru, a video of a Muslim woman being molested and verbally abused by a BJP worker has gone viral on social media. The video has gone viral on social media where the woman is seen sobbing silently while the BJP worker is seen berating her for raising a 'false complaint' and telling her that 'Muslims should clean the streets'.This is not the first time that a BJP leader has abused a female BJP worker on social media. In June, a BJP worker had harassed a Congress worker on Facebook, using insulting comments directed at her based on her gender. In July, the BJP worker had uploaded a video where he was holding a copy of the Hindu Dharma Sangam (Hindu scripture) with slogans of 'Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao' and 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' written on it and threatened women using derogatory words.<|endoftext|>Image copyright AFP Image caption The Chinese city's first high-speed train passed a major milestone last month

Beijing has announced a plan to build its first high-speed rail line, expected to take three decades to complete.

"The construction will see the highest level of speed in the world," Beijing Railway spokesman Chen Long said at a meeting on Wednesday.

He said that after the line to Zhejiang province was completed, Chinese authorities would turn to Beijing West Railway to build the second.

Beijing is currently building a line to Chengdu, about 200km (125 miles) from Shanghai.

The news comes amid growing anger in the Chinese world that Beijing is moving too slowly.

On 1 July, thousands of people braved rain to protest in Tiananmen Square against the central government's perceived slow response to a series of smog-related incidents in the city.

According to China's ministry of environmental protection, air pollution there has reached the highest level in three decades.

China has spent billions on new and upgraded roads and rail lines over the last decade.

Its rapid urban growth has produced hundreds of millions of cars and vehicles. But the country is still choking on pollution from its car-dominated economy.

Officials have argued they are moving too slowly to reduce their reliance on China's ageing factories and factories that produce relatively dirty vehicles.

Last week a former official from the state-controlled China Railway Corporation, which built the first railway line between Beijing and Shanghai, claimed he was kicked out of the organisation for questioning the authorities' lack of commitment to reducing traffic.<|endoftext|>Funny and awkward moments from Wednesday's Republican presidential debate are hitting Facebook, Twitter and, at last count, Twitter is breaking record after record.

"My tweet went all over Twitter," tweeted the candidate himself. "What I said went everywhere."

Funny and awkward moments from Wednesday's Republican presidential debate are hitting Facebook, Twitter and, at last count, Twitter is breaking record after record.

Some of those moments included some truly embarrassing moments for the candidates, others just included some hilarious and, at least when it comes to Trump, cringe-inducing moments.

But what they had in store for the American public on Wednesday, according to the campaign: A big audience and a lot of laughs. Here are just a few of the Twitter-able moments we learned about tonight ...

When the "Trump" in "Trump-Ryan" is "tense."

The first moment we heard about the vice presidential debate came when Republican vice presidential candidate Gov. Mike Pence took offense at what he thought was a disrespectful and un-American suggestion that Ryan wants to privatize Medicare.

"My colleague from Wisconsin stood up and called the vice president's idea 'Trumpcare — not Trumpcare,'" he said at the debate in Harrisburg.

Trump's response? "No I didn't," he said. Pence, naturally a little embarrassed, continued in the same vein and added that Ryan and the rest of the Republican Party "don't want your Medicare!"

Here's what Trump said about that moment during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity moments later: "I said I don't want to cut anybody's Medicare, and Mike, I hear that, okay? I heard you last night on air, and I heard it last night at the debate here in Pennsylvania ... because I had a great response."

When Donald Trump said he's "running for a certain term" (and not for re-election).

It's an important distinction to keep in mind when discussing Donald Trump.

"I am running. I have been. I am about to be," he told CNN on Wednesday morning, and then went on to add, "I have never been a politician."

It's not the size of the government that matters, but how big those government services are. In this episode of Business Insider's The Atlas Network, we talk to our co-host Daniel Cohan (@DanielCohan) about the importance of government regulation. Is it the government's job to make sure all that big-dollar corporate money in politics isn't a problem, or is it better left to a free, market-oriented economy?

If you listened to an episode of The Atlas Network before this one, you'll remember Dan also discussed the importance of privacy and how that's being eroded by big-data firms.

The new episode is available as a podcast and audio version here:

For episode 54, "The Public and Its Services"

Are you paying for your roads, water, and the internet? Are you footing the bill for your schools or the police? If so, you might be asking yourself - at least some of the time - "What's the point?" Is it possible to get value out of the way we tax, control, and allocate the public services and infrastructure that we're all a part of?

For episode 55, "The Value of Regulation"

"The government cannot ensure a level playing field of competition or enforce a fair price, but it can certainly control prices, increase the quality of services, and limit the market for bad products" - economist Milton Friedman "In the absence of competitive markets, competition is at war with the consumer. And in the presence of competition, price discrimination is the natural state of affairs. In other words, the less competition there is, the better prices will be. That's one of the primary functions of government, and that's how they get prices above their free-market level" - Charles River Laboratories' CEO, Tom Dickson, PhD

For episode 56, "The Tax and Spending Debate"

As Republicans continue their attack on public transportation, we look at a similar theme in our next episode in this series. Are taxes the only way we can pay for roads, public transportation, and other core services? Or are we better off seeing these services funded by a simple "toll fee" to cover the cost of carrying people through the cities and towns with which they're connected?

On the show today, we discuss the issues with author, economist, and fellow Forbes contributor Richard A. Epstein, along with business and regulatory journalist David U. Huggins, an associate professor at Virginia Tech, and author, entrepreneur, and political activist Matt Stoller.

In this episode, we'll be diving into a topic that is often left out of the national discussion of government and the economy: the government's role in supporting businesses. After all, in America, a "job creator" is really just another "job loser." Is this the role it should play? As we explore this question in this episode, we'll also explore other questions we can answer about government, like what is government doing differently in the private sector, and what role it should have in addressing the pressing environmental, social, and health challenges facing our world today.

In one of the most spectacular performances he has ever had, Steve McQueen managed to outwit or outmaneuver not just John Wayne, but also the whole gang of silent Hollywood stars who accompanied him onto the red carpet at the premiere for his first film, The Great Escape. On September 6, 1949, on the eve of the release of his third film, The Quiet Man, McQueen managed to get Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable, and Gary Cooper to fall for him at the premiere.

The Great Escape was not only the final film released by the renowned director, director of Bullitt, and Oscar nominee, it was a surprise smash at the box office and its legacy is still felt today. Although it has now been over 50 years since the film first hit screens and McQueen has since become just another Hollywood star, he still has some of his fans who can't get enough of his talent.

Steve McQueen always loved to perform in front of an audience. His first role in a feature film was in 1939 when he starred as a young con man in a comedy about a thief who is hired to rescue a rich lady. He was also featured in a few films during World War II, including Casablanca and The African Queen, which he also directed. His big break came in 1952 when his friend Sam Peckinpah recommended him to producer William Fox for a potential movie adaptation of the novel, The Man Without a Face, which would have starred the then young Christopher Reeves and co-starred Laurence Olivier.

During production of The Great Escape, the main issue on the crew's mind was that McQueen had no experience in filmmaking. Peckinpah, however, knew that McQueen's ability to get through a film would make them all better actors. Fox told McQueen he would have an opportunity to star in The Great Escape.

After The Great Escape, McQueen's movies became a bigger priority than any other. He never stopped working in movies for the rest of his life. In addition to his own movies, he also continued to perform for audiences at plays and festivals everywhere.

While his fans may not be able to put their hands on him much anymore, Steve McQueen still has a lot of love for the films and movie stars that have come in his wake. The silent era wasn't all about glamor and acting. This era marked the beginnings of the Hollywood career of many legends like Marlene Dietrich, George Peppard, Jimmy Stewart, and Clark Gable.<|endoftext|>Mumbai: After the success of his book 'The Outsider', Ruchir Sharma is making the rounds across India to help young writers take their talent a stage beyond.

On Sunday, while speaking in Mumbai, the author of "The Last Supper" and "The Last Temptation of Christ" gave an idea on how the community of writers can help them become "global superstars". He told the audience he sees himself as a teacher and that a writer should have a "fondness" for the community. "A lot of writers have left the community and there is no literature here," said Sharma, who has set up the Sushma Swaraj Literary Programme, that aims to ensure that young writers are given a platform. "If you are not writing, you are missing the opportunity for greatness."

Sharma said there is a scarcity of literature in the country. "This is because most writers do not have the talent or inclination to explore new areas." However, he added that if they can write "in any language" then it will help them. "So, if I write in English, I will write in the language of our forefathers," said Sharma, who believes that writing in a language one knows is not a bad thing. "I cannot read Shakespeare in Malayalam, but I can write it," he said.

Sharma spoke on the 'writing' theme. "Writing means doing something. No matter where you go, your writing will follow you."

He then talked about the value of the novel. "What makes a novel good is a character, the plot, the ending, and of course, the dialogue," said the author.

However, in a clear dig, Sharma said that as the country has become more global today, writers need to take better care of themselves. "Literary work is not only a profession, it is also a lifestyle," said Sharma.

He added that writers should remember the value of books as well and that they are "a medium of education too". He advised new writers to create a "personal brand" by "writing in a language they speak, and writing an interesting story they feel proud of".

He added that to encourage young writers to write, the books should inspire them. Sharma asked the audience how they feel about the quality of books being published, and said he is surprised at the difference in quality of books today compared to when he started writing. "

The most important thing to remember about a game's opening minute is that time is running out.

The goal in the fourth minute is to start the first real offense of the game. With three minutes left, the game is decided. The defense will get tired; the forwards will not. The offense will have to work extremely hard to keep up with fatigue. There will be a lot of pressure on the offense. We have so much at stake -- we can't give them a chance to play.

I love games like this. The first half is a grind, but the second half is fun. The defense takes advantage of having the ball against the run of play. It gives the offense more time. The defense knows they have a huge advantage in this situation. The offensive players have to give a great effort. They all know that fatigue is a great weapon and how much time they have at the end of the half.

That is the reason I love the final 15 minutes in the first quarter. You can see that all the energy and effort in the first quarter isn't getting them far enough. In the final 15 minutes, the defense makes a lot of tackles. The offense is finding open receivers. They don't take shots anymore. They don't put the clock down on the ball. They don't score two points on some meaningless field goal attempt. They play hard and play smart, and the game comes back their way.

In the past 20 years, there have been great defenses that have struggled to generate any offense. But the offenses have always gotten it done in the final 15 minutes of the game.

In 1985, the Miami Dolphins went to the Super Bowl having allowed 11.5 points to their opponents in the final 15 minutes. In 1988, the San Francisco 49ers made it to another Super Bowl after allowing 13.5 points in the final quarter. In 1987, the Washington Redskins went to the Super Bowl with 17.5 points allowed in the final 15 minutes. In both of those instances, the teams' coaches and players had an idea about how they could make the final minutes more productive. The Niners' coordinator at the time, Jim Mora, went ahead and tried it.

In 1988, the Denver Broncos' defense, which was the best in the league, gave up nine points in the final minute, with all three points coming on a two-point conversion attempt. They were down four points with 10 minutes to go in the game. The offense, running well down the stretch, went for it on fourth down with 14 seconds left and failed.

Mora was so confident that he tried it three times.

If you're a head-coaching candidate today thinking about running something similar, you are smart as a whip. That is why it is so important that your defense and offense come in the same mindset and have the same mindset.

This is not about changing an offense you don't like or make a trade-off you don't want to make. This is about putting together the entire team, from the quarterback on down, that will give you an opportunity to win the game. Make some adjustments. Be realistic. If it is in the end the right call, then do it! Run the ball and be aggressive, but do not be afraid to run if you have an opportunity to make a play down the stretch. If not, there are two ways to put together a winning team: You can put together one of those teams that give up 10 or so points in the final minute and play conservatively, or you can win on defense.<|endoftext|>In the latest example of how the public is being manipulated by the elite, the UK's most prestigious award-winning TV show has used its annual gala event to launch a program called 'Paedophiles and Perverts' in order to censor the real story.

Channel 4's flagship Today programme – used by most of the world's media outlets for its top stories each day – did its part in this latest media manipulation and hyped the show with a press release from its marketing and communications department on Tuesday.

The statement was headlined "Paedophiles and Perverted People: the truth about the truth of Paedophiles". It was a blatant attempt to downplay the real extent of sexual abuse and grooming of children by paedophiles in the U.K. – and the real perpetrators of the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children.

The programme, titled Paedophiles and Pervert Relationships, used footage from the award-winning documentary Childline, to show the dangers to young people as perpetrators groom and abuse children. The new reality for young people is that they can receive advice on how to protect themselves from predators, which is a step in the right direction. But despite this, the program was still unable to give the real truth because child protection agencies refuse to recognise that there are victims that can be spoken about, particularly as there was not enough time for the guests to properly

It was a bad week for Louis C.K., but it's been one that he didn't want. A report Sunday in the New York Times about the comedian, who's in the midst of a stand-up tour to support the premiere of his Netflix special, revealed that he had been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women in the past, including a woman who had a sexual encounter with him at a television writers dinner. The allegations came after The Times published an investigation into his behavior over the past three decades, including several incidents that involved women at work, and he apologized for the behavior. In a statement posted online, C.K. announced the cancellation of his tour, and he promised to speak out against harassment in the workplace. (C.K.'s statement also was posted on the website of another comedian, Hannibal Buress, who spoke out against harassment earlier in the week.)

Now he's being sued for allegedly violating a confidentiality agreement he signed in 2013. According to the Daily Beast, attorney Jeffrey Herman filed a lawsuit on behalf of another comedian, Dana Min Goodman (which is being represented by Gloria Allred). In it, he alleges that C.K. did not disclose that he had paid himself as a producer of HBO's "Behind the Candelabra," which came after his stand-up show, "Horace and Pete." Herman also says C.K. "threatened his clients" and made "unwanted sexual advances" to many of them, including two whom he paid $3 million to appear in his film "I Love You, Daddy" (which C.K. denied making). (In 2013, C.K. told the Times that he and his wife, Dana, parted ways with the producer after two years of marriage, after he said he discovered an affair with a woman who was working on "Behind the Candelabra.")

Herman says there were "two agreements that Mr. Louis C.K. violated. The first was a confidentiality agreement." He alleges that C.K. provided a false and misleading description of "Underage Girls" in the film to prevent Goodman from disclosing it to female cast and crew members.

C.K's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<|endoftext|>Bikepacking is a way to get away from the hustle, bustle and traffic of city living and enjoy the natural beauty of the Rockies.

I was recently doing some reading on the different types of solar panels for home solar power and noticed that they come in several variations.

The first is what I call a Class I PV panel. This is the simplest type, which is good for small solar installations. The next is a Class II PV panel, meaning that it features larger cells and can produce more electricity. A Class III PV panel is the ultimate goal, with a large (2M+) cells and the ability to produce enough power for even the most efficient solar installations. All of these variations of class can be done on a single module.

Class II panels are easier to make, but it's not as cheap and easy to do a class III panel.

So how do you make a Class I panel?

In this article I'm going to show you how to make a Class I class II solar panel. This is a low power, high efficiency, single module, solar panel that you can use to charge your phone while also producing electricity for your home and your electric grid.

The Module

The first thing you need to do is to decide on the module size and your desired power output. You will see pictures of these options from multiple suppliers below, but there are 4 basic sizes to choose from; 1kW, 2kW, 3kW, and 4kW. The size of the module is a critical parameter for its production efficiency. It's important because large modules will require a lot of engineering effort to increase their efficiency.

Size of Module

1kW: The size of my Module

2kW: The size my module is in

3kW: The size my Module is in

4kW: The size my Module is in

When choosing a solar panel to use for your solar generation home system, keep this in mind. The smaller the module size the larger the solar panels they will need to be to generate enough power to charge a smartphone or battery.

If you're using a Class I module, I can recommend SolarEdge – they are the makers of the popular SunEdison modules. SolarEdge uses a proprietary technique to increase their efficiency. They have found a combination of heat transfer and air flow to increase their output and lower their costs for solar modules. You can't really go wrong with SolarEdge and they are a popular choice for many homeowners. The main problem is the installation.

Installation of Class I Solar Panels

If you are using a 2kW module for your home solar power project, you will need to install additional wiring and install multiple solar panels in your home.

The Installation is not as hard as it looks and will take you around 30% longer than a regular install. However, it is cheaper to do than a regular panel installation. I will show you a video of our installation process below.

Using Class I panels, and installing on the roof or in your garage, the system can have a large solar panel array to generate electricity from sunny windows.

The Problem with Class II and Class III Solar Panels

Class II and Class III solar power systems will have higher panel efficiencies because of the larger sizes. However, these modules are more expensive – around $3 per watt. They can also be quite a bit heavier than Class 1, 3, and 4 modules. These modules aren't cheap, but you can always make them less expensive if need to.

I chose a Class IV PV or PVP module to make my home solar power systems, but I don't recommend you choose an even bigger module if you're using 2kW or less. The cost of a class IV module could be a lot higher than 2kW if the manufacturer can keep the cost down.

I will show you several different way to install single class I and II solar panels. They all have pros and cons. I'll show you a quick way to install class I and class 2 solar panels on a single roof and also show you how to install class 3 solar panels with a 2kW panel.

These panels are smaller than the 3kW class I panels, but their efficiency is higher. As mentioned, it's also a lot heavier than Class 1 panels. If you're doing a lot more than solar panels, this is the type of system you will want to have.

These solar modules are a great choice for your utility, your mobile home, or any type of small home. They also are very easy to install and use. It's like an easy to install energy backup in the garage.

I'll also give you the option to install your solar system without adding any additional wiring to the home or garage. I'll also have you install the panels yourself, or just let me do it for you.

How to make a Class I and II Solar Panel

First things first if you are doing the home solar installation without adding any additional wired wiring, you can make

The first step of the new series of "Unleashed" was a discussion about the role of women in the game industry. Today, I am discussing another topic: the impact of feminist gamers on game culture.

The first step of the new series of "Unleashed" was a discussion about the role of women in the game industry. Today, I am discussing another topic: the impact of feminist gamers on game culture. This issue touches a lot of different aspects of game culture; not the least because the gaming community is composed of a whole bunch of different people, from many different backgrounds, with different social and economic statuses.

On Twitter the first conversation of the topic started with an inquiry by a feminist, Kate Edwards, on the prevalence of sexism in the gaming community:

There should also be an ongoing discussion regarding the presence (or lack thereof) of a diverse enough group of women in the gaming community. If they could come up with some kind of statistics that should be collected and published so that we can discuss them, that would be useful.

I immediately went, I don't know, to look at some numbers, but I quickly learned of a major flaw in Edwards' method. When you have a set of numbers it's easy to try to extrapolate those numbers to the entire culture, assuming that every member of the entire culture shares the same values. It's very easy to forget that people come from different places in their lives and that their situation may not have the same characteristics as yours. As someone who grew up with both an only child and a divorced parent, this is really important to know.

But that was not the end of Edwards' inquiries. Edwards then took this a little further, asking in another thread about the "toxic masculinity of the game industry". I started by offering all kinds of different ways that toxic masculinity could manifest in the gamer culture:

I'm all for having a lot of discussions about this. But it can get quite exhausting when a woman in particular says that all men are like that. I mean, this is a conversation I was having with a friend of mine (about all men in the world!) and she said "You know, I'm so sick of this 'all men are toxic' stuff!". I thought it was pretty typical of her—she likes to use terms like 'all people' and 'all men' and I tried to get her to really think about what she was trying to say. She's also one of the few people I know that is not into gaming and that seems weird to me. I'm thinking about the differences between gaming culture and, like, a bunch of other interests where some people are 'all' into gaming and some are not. I'm not saying any of that to sound like I'm trying to be some sort of misogynist… But I am saying that people who are 'all' into gaming don't automatically fit the general definition of toxic. It's just like, I know a lot of gay people or ethnic minority people that are into sports (or movies or anything else) and the same could be said for gay or black or latino people who are into music. There's a difference between being into them all and then being totally toxic.

The problem is that I was speaking to my friend not the general public and Edwards wasn't paying attention to anything outside of my friend's world. She didn't take into account what people might be going through or what other games they might enjoy. She wasn't thinking critically about a society that she did not have much experience in and didn't truly understand what being a gamer was all about.

And now comes the big point: Edwards is not talking about everyone who plays games as a whole. I would love to have this wonderful discussion about the presence or absence of women in games as a whole (which is very difficult to do) but instead I get to waste my time answering someone who has clearly only a very small amount of experience in the gaming community, not to mention being extremely confused about the nature of toxic masculinity.

This is why I want to focus on what Edwards did say when I asked about the impact of gamer culture on feminism:

I feel like it's kind of an important thing for people to know that not all gamers are like that; I know there are some really amazing gamers out there and I'm a big fan of indie games, but there are some really toxic people out there as well (I don't really want to say which ones because I don't want to harass any of them in real life). If we would be talking about people who make games and why, we would focus a lot more on women in indie games when they're in games instead of the people who aren't even playing games enough to vote on games (or, honestly, the people who want to start games in the first place but don't have the skills and education to do so).

I disagree strongly with the suggestion that we should focus on game

The Oregon Senate Education Committee on Wednesday approved Gov. Kate Brown's proposal to spend $7.7 million annually to provide college scholarships to children of incarcerated men and women. The committee's action followed a hearing in the early morning hours.

The proposal, which is likely to face a House floor vote by the end of the year, is sponsored by Sen. Jim Beall, D-Salem, and Sen. Jeanie Forrester, D-Portland. In a joint news release, Brown and Forrester called the measure to promote education for young people "an important step forward in the restoration of education to kids and adults who have been imprisoned after their release."

The money would come from a $9,200,000 grant the Oregon state Legislature created in 2014 for the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Board.

As with many of Brown's education proposals, the timing could not be better for supporters. The House's 2014-15 spending plan approved in June includes $25 million of that grant for the Oregon Opportunity Grant, the state's version of Title I funding; the governor's budget proposal to be approved on Thursday will likely include $2.8 million of it plus extra money from the Legislature.

Oregon's Opportunity Grants are intended to provide low-income kids with a college education, though many other states use them for funding elementary education. The grant is for a maximum of $19,000, though students with incomes below that amount can apply for grants as low as $7,200. Some of the money is spent on tutoring, college counseling and other educational resources. The state has spent $1.2 billion since 2002 on the program.

In testimony before the Legislature's special committee on juvenile justice, former University of Washington Chancellor James R. Fowler was critical of the Opportunity Grant program, saying it often focuses on a limited range of potential uses, and does not provide enough help to students who come from families with little education. "For decades now, the program as it stands has been designed for families that have incomes below $35,000," Fowler said, speaking to one program intended to provide college scholarships to students from low-income homes.

Many students who participate in Opportunity Grants come from families with serious criminal histories. More than 70 percent of Opportunity Grant applicants in 2012 were students of color, compared to just about half of students in all of the other programs, according to the governor's Office of Planning and Budget.

During the committee hearing, several opponents of the measure spoke, mostly against the idea of subsidizing college education for high-risk offenders, saying it would be too expensive and the state budget would suffer if funds were diverted to higher-needs students.

Forrester, who said she had been working to make college accessible to low-income students for years, agreed with those points and took aim at the program's focus on helping kids who can't afford college even if they qualify. "A lot of these grant programs, you start by saying you're going to help these kids but the money you give to them is not going to enable them to go to college," Forrester said. Her proposal would pay for tuition and other costs and allow eligible students to receive aid for college even if they already have some post-graduation education or training.

Supporters have also argued the grants are an effective way to promote educational achievement among at-risk youth. Forrester said her proposal will make it easier for people to get help from local colleges to pay for college, which could otherwise remain expensive for many students.

Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Klamath Falls, who voted in favor of the plan at Tuesday's hearing, said the Senate could eventually vote on it as an amendment to the state budget, likely in February.

In the meantime, he said, it is important to take care of students already in our community because they don't have a voice in the Legislature.

The bill is SB 959.<|endoftext|>"We all want to keep kids safe. Parents, teachers, and administrators at our schools want to do everything they can to make sure their children know they're being heard," said Toms River Police Capt. George Larkin.


It is the second time in two years a local police department has teamed up with the Toms River Police Department and the NJSPCC Family Violence Prevention Program to fight crime. The first partnership was two years ago when the Toms River Police Department partnered with the Camden County Sheriff's Office Crime Bureau and New Jersey State Police.


"When it comes to fighting violent crime, we need everyone out there with a gun to make sure they're safe," said Lt. Mike Cifuentes of the Toms River Police Department. "We want a partnership with our state representatives so they can help us keep people safe and protect our youth."

After more than a decade of trying to develop a universal vaccine, federal officials say they have developed a candidate with potential, making the first step toward creating the vaccine from which a preventative vaccine could be delivered on schedule and at relatively little cost to every child in the United States.The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced the results of its Phase 3 trial at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) on June 22. If researchers approve a candidate for large-scale testing, they'll use the candidate -- called GSK's tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine -- to make vaccine as an effective, safe and efficacious prevention tool for infants and children who are too young to receive the MMR vaccine for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). If approved, the vaccine would be given via the recommended series of doses, four months apart, starting at 2 months of age.In a paper published on Monday, NIH Director Francis Collins said he's confident in the vaccine's safety, effectiveness and likely route to licensure as part of the U.S. childhood vaccination strategy under the new policy, known as the Childhood Vaccine Injury Prevention Act of 2008.He said, "This study supports the decision that we made over a decade ago to invest in, and test, the first universal immunization against Td. We believe this is now a very strong candidate."Researchers looked at nearly 200,000 vaccinated children and found that a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine containing tetanus toxoid and a single dose of diphtheria toxoid were able to effectively protect them from the disease. The researchers reported no unexpected side effects associated with the vaccine, none of which could exceed five days of mild fever or any serious complications that could cause life-long paralysis or disfigurement. The vaccine was administered to infants at 2.6 months, 3 months, 4 months and 5 months.The vaccine produced the exact amount of antibody in the blood required to protect against diphtheria. The researchers reported that it could prevent 95 percent of diphtheria hospitalizations among 1,924 pre-adolescent children. The vaccine is expected to be licensed for immunization in 2010.To make it effective in children, the vaccine contains small amounts of tetanus and diphtheria toxins from the mother, which are delivered using an adenovirus that infects the mother, who passes it to the fetus through the placenta before delivery. The researchers reported that a combination of six vaccines produced the level of tetanus and diphtheria antibodies needed to provide protection.The government's new policy requires all infants, children aged 6 months or older and infants and children with immunocompromising diseases to receive at least one dose of the Td vaccine by the age of 12 months. That's the same schedule of vaccinations recommended for children who already received the MMR vaccine in school.In addition, the policy requires all infants, children aged 6 to 17, pregnant women and adolescents who have any history of autoimmune, congenital, neurodevelopmental or other chronic health conditions that could interfere with the immune response to the Td vaccine to receive at least two doses in any one year through ages 20 to 24, as well as two doses of the additional Td component later in life.The NIH has three years to submit the data needed for FDA licensure.Collins said he expects to see the new vaccine on the market within five years. He believes that the vaccine will be available for the cost of a third round of MMR vaccine, which is currently $21.50.<|endoftext|>A new report by the Pew Research Center reveals America's political divide, and what that means for the next president.

A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals America's political divide, and what that means for the next president. As Pew explains, the 2016 presidential election is shaping up to be a "deeply partisan conflict over where the nation stands in the broader arc of American history" that has brought Republican Donald Trump into an increasingly heated, and increasingly personal battle that will decide which party holds the Oval Office.


Pew found that the nation is more divided along partisan lines than at any point in 25 years. Only 27 percent of the public describes itself as "moderate." That's a stunning 20 points lower than when Pew last did an analysis in 2004. When it comes to their policy preferences, meanwhile, the public has broken deeply into two groups. The GOP is getting much more extreme, Pew found, while the Democratic party is becoming more center-left.

In addition to these stark divisions, Pew found that the ideological divide that has become the hallmark of modern politics is much more pronounced, and more pronounced along political lines than it used be.

Overall, the new divide is more about the partisan makeup of the nation's political parties than it is about any particular ideology. But it does seem that the Republican Party has become more ideologically extreme in the past decade

"America is now home to a growing legion of citizens who have made pilgrimages to some of New York's most extraordinary works like the Empire State Building, the Great Wall of China, the Hudson River, the Statue of Liberty, the White House, the Central Park Zoo, the New York Public Library, Central Park, The New York Public Library, Broadway shows, and the Brooklyn Museum. These are the city's hidden treasures, and their visitors are not just a public-relations boon for the city. They are paying for the upkeep of these places with taxes that are more than 10 times the average annual local income in New York City….The visitor to Manhattan can now get a glimpse not just of the tallest building in the Eastern Hemisphere, but also the most spectacular building in the United States. In the end, all those billions of dollars of public dollars have made the public feel a bit closer to the things that they cherish and value and share their lives with."

(New York Times)

I read a lot of the same stuff here. I read the book The Great Wall of China in college, as one of my senior projects. I read that it will take at least $50 billion and a total of 15 years, or 20 years for a permanent wall — to complete the restoration. So…I guess I'm pretty okay with the financial burden. But what I'm not okay with is the idea that these places are private property. I'm not happy that they are owned by us mere mortals, that we can go there and enjoy them. I never thought of it like that. I thought the places were in the public domain, and it was up to me as a visitor, as a citizen of this little blue marble patch of the universe, to ensure that my money was being used to conserve.

In the book, the writer, Brian Moylan, says that "some visitors are offended when they see American national parks managed by Washington, D.C., or the National Park Service in other nations run by the U.S. government." And he asks "how on earth the United States government is going to manage a project as monumental as the Empire State Building or the Great Wall of China." It's not just foreigners who feel this way — Americans too:

"American visitors to China often come back more critical of the Chinese economy than they did in China itself. If you go to China, you don't see a thriving private sector," says one U.S. visitor, who works in a Chinese office-supply company and speaks on the condition of anonymity. "But if you go to the U.S.–Western border, like New York City, you see the thriving private sector," he adds, though he doesn't mean the financial sector, but the entrepreneurial sector that serves the public sector.

So I'm just as happy as you that money is being spent to restore some of our best remaining heritage sites. But I'm angry that the public is paying for it.

Kathleen Pao is the interim CEO of Reddit. (Courtesy of Twitter)

In a first, a male executive on tech's hottest firm — Reddit — has resigned from the board after a sexist lawsuit led to a gender discrimination suit. When Reddit's chief executive, Ellen Pao, first took over as CEO in February, she told reporters that it would take time for the site to find its own way. After she faced a gender discrimination lawsuit last week, Pao sent an apology to users Wednesday. She wrote that the board had asked her to step down effective immediately. "I want to apologize personally to each of you for the pain and frustration I have caused," the former Kleiner Perkins executive wrote on the site.

The resignations were a signal to Reddit's roughly 300 million daily users that Pao was serious about making Reddit a better place for women to gather. It came on the same day Twitter announced plans to ban three accounts that impersonated actress Rose McGowan, who had been a vocal opponent of Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey after he was forced out as CEO last month.

While the backlash to Pao's firing has been swift from users, the broader tech industry is weighing in. At least one of the biggest names in venture capital is backing the New York Public Library's purchase of Reddit.

Reddit shares fell 3.5 percent after closing trading Friday at $18.08.

"This is a major development. It's just like what Twitter did," said Brian Wieser, chief executive of Pivotal Research Group, an analyst who has been closely following Reddit and its growth. "It's a sign that more and more investors are getting it.

[Ellen Pao to step down as Reddit CEO, in her own words]

But some say Pao will be able to find support among some of Reddit's board members, which includes former PayPal and eBay executive Sam Altman, Yahoo Chairman Marissa Mayer and Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, as well as venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

"If you're a company on the board of directors that wants to work with Reddit, then this situation is a major sign the board is really interested to see how they can grow," said Dan Schawbel, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been closely observing Reddit and the wider Internet community. That's because Pao's departure won't impact the company's ability to operate its popular online platform, he noted.

Still, the move may not make a dent in the company's revenue, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all the Internet services Google offers. Many investors aren't convinced that Reddit is a better long-term bet than many of the others with billions of dollars in venture capital backing.

"This is a classic Silicon Valley story — a company that's a startup, but has the resources of a big company," said Robert Peck, managing director and director of enterprise and social investing at Ritholtz Wealth Management. "It was very evident that Ellen felt the need to get rid of the board to make moves. She may be right, but this isn't a good outcome for Reddit."

Pao's decision to step down comes six weeks after she brought a female CEO to her office, and a year after a male counterpart.

"Everyone is really focused on the change taking place at Reddit that has the potential to grow the company and attract new users," said Huffman, who had been Reddit's chief operating officer since 2007.

Huffman said he planned to "take Reddit to an even higher level of success than what it is today."

Last month, Reddit's website attracted more than 170 million unique visitors to its websites, representing a 25 percent increase from the same time last year.

Pao was a former chief executive of Silicon Valley's Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, according to her LinkedIn profiles. She joined Yahoo in July 2011, where she served as a business development officer and director of diversity.

Pao, in a statement provided by a spokesman, said she is taking responsibility for her "error of judgment." "I made a mistake by allowing some Reddit fans to engage in harassing behavior," she said in the statement. "I regret that they felt they could make me the worst CEO in the world." She added: "I am committed to creating a Reddit that is welcoming to everyone."<|endoftext|>The following document gives a brief guide to the process of getting an Australian visa or an Australian citizenship.

"When two sides are at each other's throats and that's the way it's going to remain, and it's going to stay and there's going to be no hope of it changing," said John Gaskins, a former United States ambassador to the EU under President George W. Bush. "So, the only thing left for you and I to do is to try to make peace."

Many in Brussels, however, are not waiting around for an all-out civil war that could destabilize other parts of Europe as Germany, France, Scandinavia and Ukraine have done in the past.

"If the United States really believes that Ukraine is an ally, they should try to help this nation not break apart," said a senior EU diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The former U.S. ambassador said that by supporting Mr. Putin, "the United States would be legitimizing his aggression, and the Europeans would have less credibility to criticize Russia."

The European Union has adopted a policy of "a strong stance" toward Russia even as the Kremlin has moved aggressively to bolster its position in eastern Ukraine with an intense wave of activity, officials and Western diplomats say.

The EU has so far frozen some $6 billion in loans to Russia, moved to suspend the delivery of natural gas to Russia and called for sanctions against Moscow and its businesses. European officials say the European Union will likely start discussing potential new penalties against Russia in its next summit meeting in December.

A number of European officials said they fear Mr. Putin could respond with aggression to any push to impose even harsher sanctions.

"When you make it clear to Russia that sanctions are inevitable and they're going to pay in consequences, you don't want to give any ammunition to Mr. Putin to say, 'You got what you deserve,'" one senior British diplomat said.

Still, the EU has shown little political will in pressing Russia. Officials said the bloc's leaders, many of whom are facing local elections on May 25, are focused on preparing for the parliamentary election in Germany and not wanting to anger voters by appearing weak on matters of mutual concern.

Still, a major diplomatic effort, led by Mr. Kerry, is under way. Mr. Kerry and other officials have been in touch with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin. They expect the United States to give Mr. Kerry "a full briefing" before a Group of Eight meeting in Northern Ireland in mid-June.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in Brussels on Thursday that "Russia continues to commit unacceptable violations of Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence using an army and paramilitary forces supported by the government."

"We are calling for Russia to stop the military build-up and support Ukrainian forces with heavy weapons and equipment," Ms. Power said.

The Obama administration plans to increase economic sanctions. The Treasury Department on Thursday announced sanctions against a small Russian bank and several energy companies that it has accused of providing money to support a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine.

That announcement was not linked to the latest developments in Ukraine, and was unlikely to change Moscow's calculation that Europe is not doing enough to stop the Russian advance. But it underscores the risks for the United States and its allies in dealing with Moscow.

President Obama has also spoken directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "They need to show some restraint, stop fueling the violence and take steps to deescalate the conflict," Mr. Obama said in a news conference with French President François Hollande on Thursday. "And ultimately, when both sides have exhausted the options for de-escalation and diplomacy to address these issues, the U.S. and Europe will consider their own responses."

Mr. Power has said that Mr. Obama is "disappointed" with Russia's recent behavior, but added that the United States will have to consider its options.

The sanctions so far have had little effect inside Russia, but they have raised fears in the West that if they are not tightened further, European citizens will stop doing business or travel to the countries that might sanction Russia.

With Russian officials in Crimea and the east, including Moscow's regional governors, publicly endorsing pro-Russia forces and Russia's military buildup in those regions, Europe has seen an increased Russian military troop presence in eastern Ukraine.

One senior American official said this week that there had been a 50 percent surge in Russian troops and heavy weapons arriving in the area of eastern Ukraine, where they have joined separatist forces who have fought back against both Ukrainian military and Russian forces.

European officials say they also see signs that Mr. Russian officials in Crimea are trying to intimidate the population into accepting its control and are using the Crimean legislature as a cover for their activities, including attempts to rewrite the country's constitution.

"They seem quite intent on trying to break up the Ukrainian Federation without war," said Christopher Harmer, head of the Eurasia Group's Europe practice.

"The most basic idea is that you're never going to see somebody win a $1 million lottery," says Stephen Gordon, CEO of AEG Capital. "There just isn't that many winners."

Gordon and other gambling experts note that people have always found fun in gambling and that the modern industry of lotteries and gambling is an outgrowth of a long-running business with a clear purpose: generating revenue for those who play.

"You're never going to see somebody win a $1 million lottery," says Gordon, the former head of the state's Gaming Control Board and an attorney who often represents the state at the U.S. Supreme Court. "There just isn't that many winners."

Gambling profits are growing at some of the fastest rates, even as the size of the country's population and its economy shrinks. For instance, at the end of 2012, the industry generated more than $50bn (£40bn) in revenue nationwide.

By comparison, a typical individual making the minimum wage brings in about $21,000 a year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

More from the Magazine The lottery has its best chance since the dawn of time, and that was before the first Powerball ticket was sold. One man with a winning ticket. But he has never seen his winnings. To him, the lottery was his ticket to a life of leisure. So why would he keep the winning ticket a secret?

But this is changing as gambling grows in popularity and states move to legalize it. The rise of gambling is often driven by economic, cultural and societal trends in society – in this case, an explosion of gambling.

"Gambling is a natural result of having so many more people around," says Gordon. "It's a phenomenon that comes, in many ways, after a period of rapid population growth and an economy that is growing like gangbusters. The more people you have to serve, the more gambling is going to come because you can attract so many people to the table."

When a lottery is played, it takes on an aura of magical certainty. It's a rite of passage for people to win anything. People can build a life in one of the many jobs associated with winning. People are attracted to the way it is perceived by society as a positive thing, especially when it is a long-term source of income, which is not only good for the gambler but for his or her family – and friends.

Gambling is now a billion-dollar business

In a sense, Gordon and many investors in casino gambling are the latest to reap the financial rewards of the industry's growth. Before the lottery was widely used by the middle class, the market was dominated by the rich. But the rich were willing to pay more for luck: "the price of success", as Gordon calls it.

"Gambling is not a victim," he says. "It's an industry. Most people have it in their families. People love the money."

The lottery has grown in popularity among the middle class as an alternative to the traditional, harder path of college. In an era when high school drop-out rate is high across the developing world, the lottery is a gateway for many children.

The more players there are, the more money we get

According to the UN, half of the world's population will never be rich. Many of them, however, fall into a group considered one of the most "inequality-stricken" in the world: the less-fortunate.

The majority of these people never become affluent and have been living with less wealth. These people, or their families, have to survive with very little, leaving them with very little spare cash.

The poor are usually at the bottom rung of society and live a difficult life because they live with less and less money – but because of the lottery they have a chance to be lucky or rich and make the other half of the population wealthy.

"It's an economic activity," says Gordon of lotteries. "It's people having a choice to play this game."

The rise of the lottery is "like the rise of the mobile phone," says Gordon. As people make more and more of their personal life choices through smartphones – and with gambling becoming a major industry, this will only continue -- people will more and more likely make the same choice.

It's an economic activity. It's people having a choice to play this game

By contrast, most of the other money-making activities – like selling products online or investing in stocks – aren't in a sense "free". They are more or less forced to operate. Like any major industry, gambling is subject to regulation in all markets.

For gambling businesses, gambling in America is seen as an industry with a bright future. It has an inherent advantage over many other forms of business: it's legal. No one

Madison — The State Crime Laboratory's chief has resigned, just more than a month after a public records request revealed he had failed to keep public records from a criminal case in which he had a personal interest.

James S. Thompson was the chief of staff to State Laboratory Director Thomas J. Stebbins and was listed as a former assistant director of the criminal lab in court filings when he was the head of the lab. Thompson, 61, who began his state career in 1975, joined the state's crime lab in 1999.

Earlier this year, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism requested public records related to a case Stebbins took on when Thompson was his assistant director of the lab in July 2012, in which a woman sued Thompson for child custody and a wrongful termination after he accused her husband of child maltreatment.

Stebbins terminated his employees without cause only once during his tenure, in 1998 when he fired an employee he said was stealing cocaine out of his desk.

The Journal Sentinel has confirmed Thompson received $500 from Stebbins' campaign fund in 2000 for the unsuccessful campaign of then-Sheriff Glenn Davis. Thompson was the only deputy sheriff to support Davis' candidacy. Davis lost to Democrat John Cullerton, who is now Milwaukee County sheriff.

Two years later, then-Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen sued Thompson over his role in the Stebbins case and other criminal cases in which he was listed as an assistant director when he led the crime lab.

The state is required to conduct ongoing criminal investigation, but the state crime lab is not. The crime lab receives about $1 million annually from the Legislature from money collected by the state attorney general, which uses the money to conduct prosecutions and investigate crimes. The state crime lab has three assistants and a director.

The Office of the Attorney General refused to release the requested documents under the state's Open Records Act. But, citing state law, Thompson resigned his assistant director and his position on the state crime lab board before the state released the records in April.

Thompson did not return calls to his home or office seeking comment.<|endoftext|>What is a microaggression?

A microaggression is an unwanted, negative remark that is directed at a targeted person—in the form of a word, the action of looking, an expression, something the victim does (e.g. touching), or the object the victim wears. Some examples of microaggressions are the following (all of these are examples that were mentioned in the original Reddit post):

Ms. Bowerman said she woke up hours later in a hospital wearing a surgical gown with her breasts exposed.

"What I remember the most was having blood trickling down the front of the gown and feeling my underwear," she said.

Ms. Bowerman said she had been the victim of what she called "sexual battery," in which a male or female attacker groped her. She said the man who molested her, now known to be Aaron C. Zilka, 30, had grabbed as much as he could get his hands on.

Mr. Zilka is the accused in a seven-count complaint, filed last week in the federal courthouse here, charging him with assault with intent to commit a sex crime, sexual battery, sexual abuse, kidnapping, assault with intent to commit a violent crime, unlawful imprisonment and threats to cause bodily harm.

His lawyer, Michael J. Schoenberg, said there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault had taken place. But he said that he expected the charges against Mr. Zilka to be rejected.

He said Mr. Zilka hoped to have his day in court, and that he did not anticipate a lengthy court battle.

"He's really hoping the truth comes out," Mr. Schoenberg said.

Mr. Zilka declined comment through the court-appointed public defender.

The study was published online in the International Journal of Cancer by a team of researchers led by Dr. Brian A. Weijenberg, a professor of radiology and bioelectrical sciences and professor emeritus of medicine in the division of pathology of the University of Calgary.

"In the future, omega-3 fatty acids may be used as a new, inexpensive and important source of energy that could reduce the need for energy-dense foods to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and obesity-related diabetes," said Weijenberg, principal investigator of the study and head of the Radiology Research and Evaluation Department. "Our findings may lead to the use of high-fat omega-3 diets in the prevention of chronic disease."

Omega-3 fats are present in fish and especially flaxseed oil. They are known to play a role in cell growth and development and are thought to protect cells from oxidation, and may even protect against age-related diseases such as breast and prostate cancer.

Weijenberg and his team analyzed the relationship between age and mortality and found that a more recent age was associated with a 10-23 per cent reduction in the risk of death in women who did not have a family history of cancer.

The researchers also identified the specific omega-3 fats present in flaxseed oil and its relation to mortality. They identified several components in flaxseed oil, including gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), as well as several omega-3 fatty acids.

The scientists also analyzed the effects of flaxseed oil on other age associated diseases including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and stroke.

Based on its effects on age-associated conditions such as coronary heart disease and diabetes, Weijenberg says flaxseed oil could be used as an alternative to stearic acid (C20:5) to replace saturated fat in the diet to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and obesity-related diabetes.

Dr. John H. Klimley, a professor of radiology and biomedical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, says the study will improve the understanding of the risk factors in women who are at high risk for developing disease.

"This study is important because it shows how dietary fatty acids can mediate a variety of health effects, including lowering cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk," he said. "The benefits of fatty acids, particularly the Omega-3s, could even extend to the prevention of cancer. In fact, we recently found that a high-flavanol-to-safflower-fat ratio could predict the development of new cancers in mice. If omega-3 fatty acids were taken up by cells in the blood, they could act to regulate the growth of the cancers."

The study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health to Dr. Brian Weijenberg.<|endoftext|>The National Football League is investigating the Houston Texans after their players took a knee at the end of the national anthem, league spokesman Joe Lockhart told USA TODAY Sports.

The amount is actually lower than what was reported last year at the beginning of this year, but the amount that was paid was higher than the $5.86 million, or about $1.27 million, that was spent by all the state's agencies and institutions in 2011.

The committee's chairman, Rep. Jonathan Singer, R-Longmont, said that this year the House is looking at reducing spending so as to keep down the amount of money coming into the general fund for lawyers for marijuana businesses. He said he wants to cut as much as $1.5 million from the General Fund for attorney fees.

The figure for fees paid last year was $18,100.00 that covered legal fees for people trying to open business accounts, or other aspects of the business. It doesn't cover expenses that are not legal, such as rent, utilities, repairs and other general business expenses.

Singer says that one of the biggest things that he's trying to cut is legal fees, and the other issue he's examining is how best to keep marijuana businesses on their own turf.

"For the most part, I think we've done a pretty good job at preventing the government from coming in and interfering," Singer said. He noted that most of the fees paid by marijuana businesses were incurred in the first several years of their operating, but he's starting to see some of these issues now.

Singer is also examining the issue of regulating those medical marijuana dispensaries, which are allowed to operate even with the full blessing of state regulators because many of them are located in unincorporated areas.

In a discussion about the medical pot dispensaries that had been approved at the state-mandated April 1 deadline, Singer said that the state has found problems with some of the people operating them.

"We'll have to get a better handle on who's involved to make sure we're not having illegal things going on," Singer said.

Singer said that he has had conversations with the Attorney General's office this year regarding the issue of regulating pot dispensaries; but he said that he did not expect any changes to the regulations.<|endoftext|>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — President Donald Trump's proposed budget would impose more stringent sanctions on Iran and cut financing to Russia, the

Kerry Jackson's time in Baltimore probably will be remembered for something other than the four-homer, three-RBI game he hit for the Orioles.

Not that what he did will be missed by those with a fondness for his big hits on the bases.

On Friday night, the Orioles traded Jackson to Oakland after the veteran slugger's one year contract was not renewed.

"We were prepared for this," general manager Dan Duquette told the Baltimore Sun. "We knew we would lose a valuable part of our team and we wanted to give up some quality prospects, but he has not provided value on the field. We had no choice."

Dujon Shelby and Michael Saunders were traded and the Orioles sent $7.5 million to Oakland along with right-handed reliever Brian Matusz ($1 million, three-years, $21 million) and pitcher John Axford ($5 million, two years, no options), according to a team announcement.

Jackson, 36, was designated for assignment by the Orioles on Wednesday.

"We all know the type of player Kerry has been," Duquette said before Saturday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. "He's always had a passion for winning. And in the minor leagues, he's proven to be one of the best baseball players out there. We knew that we needed to make a change."

Although Jackson's production dropped over his first two seasons — his last two seasons in the majors ended with 15 home runs and 62 RBI — his overall value still was enough to warrant the move.

Jackson hit .259 with three homers, 24 RBI and 37 runs scored in 72 games this season.<|endoftext|>The former president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, has called for Britain to leave the EU after the Brexit vote, saying that Britain would be "irreparably damaged" if it left.

Speaking to The Telegraph he said: "All the arguments we used when the Brits left were right and they would be equally valid now."

"Britain leaving the EU will be a huge setback for Europe and the European project."

Mr Schulz said he believed Theresa May was not a "good partner for Europe" as she had previously claimed, despite the recent visit from the Prime Minister.

He added: "I have been saying to [Mrs May] that Britain will be irreparably damaged if it leaves the European Union and [they say] that it's not the case.

"It's the beginning of a bad phase. And I don't know what she thinks the consequences will be."

In a wide-ranging interview to mark his first year as president — during which he will officially take over from former European Parliament president Martin Schulz — the German MP also said he believes that the UK would make a "superior" and "much better" country outside the EU.

While the British people would remain free to take out their pensions in the EU, he added, "the people will not be able to vote for their own money in Brussels".

He also confirmed that he would not seek to become the new president of the European Commission when his mandate ends in 2019 and said Brussels was becoming "notorious" in Europe.

"One can understand why people think that now Brussels is becoming notorious. It has to change. It is not working," Mr Schulz said of the city of Brussels, adding that he plans to use his first year to improve the European Parliament's reputation.

The European Parliament president said he was currently preparing for his first working visit in the European Council — the gathering of the heads of state and government — with President Donald Tusk and EU Council President Donald Tusk.

Mrs May is now likely to set out her plans for Brexit in the next few months at the EU summit meeting in Malta next month, Mr Schulz said.

"It will be a very complicated process and there will be a few surprises in her speech," he said.

"It has to be about Britain. It is not just about the future relationship with the UK."

But despite Mr Schulz's doubts about Britain remaining in the EU if it leaves the bloc in February 2019, the former Socialist MEP said he did not believe it would have a negative impact on the UK.

Speaking about the possible future of the UK leaving the bloc, he continued: "I don't think Brexit will have an adverse effect on the UK.

"For me it is about Europe."<|endoftext|>"No matter how much I wanted [this interview] to be the last thing to ever happen, I thought it was an important story to tell.

This is the first of a two-part article, featuring the early work of the prolific Belgian painter Auguste Crécy

Auguste Crécy (1848-1919), or as he was known to the English-speaking world, Auguste Rodin, was an important French art historical artist, one of the most influential figures of the avant-garde.

An internationally renowned painter who specialized in a particular formal style known as Impressionism (or 'impressionism', in its popularized form), Crécy's work featured abstract images in highly emotional, sensual and often ambiguous compositions. He was perhaps the most acclaimed and prolific painter of his time.

Crécy worked mainly in the romantic styles of the early 20th century, where he employed a combination of forms including monumentalism, formalism, color theory and sculpture. His paintings are characterized by an almost romantic naivety, and many of his works were commissioned by famous artists or patrons, such as Auguste Rodin. His style, especially since the 1920s, was associated with the work of Gustave Courbet who was the subject of an influential French magazine article of the same name. Courbet studied under Crécy at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which was a major influence on his style.

From 1902-1959, Crécy worked as a painter for the Boulogne museum in France. His first work was published in the Paris journal Le Peintre in August 1897, where he produced nine illustrations for the magazine. These drawings (published as a serial in Le Peintre between September 1897 and 1894) are notable for the emotional intensity and eroticism expressed in the subjects, which were mostly female body forms. His second work was entitled L'Onde de la Chasse. These drawings took Crécy's style in a more abstract direction. Although some critics consider him a modernist in his abstract expressionism, his work does not follow this same trend. His work as a painter was recognized by the French authorities but his influence and popularity in the early 20th century, both internationally and by France, has been recognized.

In 1901 Crécy established a studio at 21 rue Réaumur in Lyon and he became known to the world on May 15th, when he was awarded the Gold Medal in the 'Degree of Art', which was awarded in Stockholm. His paintings are regarded as important figures in the development of art at this time.

In 1922, Crécy returned to the Boulogne and published the first of a series of his painting entitled Les Cérémonieux (Cement Houses). The second of these was Les Petites Chiffres (The Little Girls), in which a woman is depicted naked with an animal on her back, in addition to some abstract forms, which were considered to be a forerunner to the influence of Cubism in the coming generations. Another piece of work entitled Les Périgines de Laffitte-le-Guérin (The Petite Girls of Laffitte-le-Guérin) appeared in 1928. The third series of Les Cérémonieux was released in 1944 and was accompanied by a lithograph entitled Mésapireur et Enfant de l'Homme ("Father and Child"), which was an important part of Crécy's later oeuvre.

The early work of Crécy has been largely unpublished, but it is clear from his correspondence with his mentor, Rodin, that Crécy made a definite impression on Rodin's mind as a result of the influence of his older artist colleague. Crécy was to stay close, working and collaborating with Rodin until his death in 1919.<|endoftext|>An Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander was killed on Saturday, as coalition forces struck at Daesh targets in northern Iraq, an IS security official has said.

"The commander of IRGC's Quds Force was killed," the official, who spoke to Press TV on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday.

The official said a large number of missiles were targeted by the coalition on five Daesh gathering bases in northern Anbar province, as the terrorists "dismay the coalition's relentless advance"

The strike was aimed at the Daesh bases located near Makhmour, according to the statement.

The official also said that several of the missiles, carried by a helicopter, hit targets on the Mosul front as the militants "reject and protest" the U.S.-led coalition's continued aerial onslaught.

The IS security official said that the military target that was struck was the Quds Force commander.

The Iranian military commander, Gen. Qassem Salavati, was also killed in another airstrike carried out by the coalition earlier in this week, a security source told Reuters.

The source said the IRGC commander was killed on Thursday as the coalition

This is a new feature. It may not work in some browsers.

When your web developer adds a new component you don't need to wait for the new version to be released. Now you can test that component with the latest web browsers in under a minute and not even wait for the update. Simply create a component in web inspector, then click "Tests: Generate Web Console" option and it will generate a simple console with some examples.

Step 1: Choose the component(s) you want to test.

Select different elements from your app and test them both. You can find the components here.

Select from any of them and click "Generate test" button.

Step 2: Build the components

This command will generate a file for your test components:

gulp test:components

This file contains all available components with their test class. You can either use the same class name or change the component class names so that you can compare and find the differences on console between different browsers. In general use the same class names for all component except for those marked with "debug".

Step 3: Create a new component test

This is a good time to start writing your test code. If you don't have any test framework installed, you can create a new test project using gulp test:gen. Just put your test files in src/test folder and run a gulp test:compile command to generate all test files in a build folder.

If you already have a web browser tested and there is no need for you to test that component any more, just delete your project folder.

Tests are run from the web console in the browser at localhost:8080/<index.html>.

If you want to create a web server based tests for a specific component, run the command: gulp run:server . This runs server side code inside the web browser on localhost:8080/index.html. As the server process is started with the command ./server , you'll also need some webserver running inside your localhost in order to serve the test files from your project. You can use any webserver that you wish and/or install web server on your machine.

A simple example test that tests a custom list (list.html):

The list.mq template defines the basic data model for the list component:

List { title: string; selectedIndexes: Map< string, List< string >>; selectedText: string; }

The component can also define its own data model ( list.mq.model ), but for now it does not use any custom data-model.

Next, create the test test for the selected text ( custom.mq.text ):

Custom Text { text: string; selectedIndexes: Map< string, List< string >>; selectedText: string; }

In order to test our text component, let's modify that first template as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> ... </head> <body> <h2 lang="en">Custom Text</h2> <list id="list"> <pre id="item">Select a text to use for a single item...</pre> </list> ... </body> </html>

The new content should look like:

<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> ... </head> <body> <h2 lang="en">Custom Text</h2> <list id="list"> <pre>Select a text to use for a single item...</pre> </list> ... </body> </html>

As you can see, we have added some new elements to the list, such as an option to select the current item and an item itself. However, we don't really want to check this data model. Let's add a check function:

check: (item) => item.selectedIndexes.Contains(4);

This function checks whether the value for the selectedIndexes property is between 4 and 7.

We can now update src/test/static/components/list.mq:

// src/test/static/components/list.mq import { List } from './list' ; import { option } from '@angular/core' ; @Component({ selector: 'list', templateUrl: 'list.html' }) export class ListComponent { list: List[] = []; selectedIndexes: Map<string, List<string>> = []; selectedText: string; selectedIndexes = []; constructor(public cb: Any) { this.list = this.cb(this.list[0]); // Remove old element this.list.remove(); this.selectedIndexes = this.db(

The next installment of the legendary franchise will take place in the heart of Hollywood and features more than 100 actors; however, those familiar with the previous films will know that it is not quite the same. The new film will be told in a way that shows no one is safe in this world, and will be a bloody, hilarious, action-packed roller coaster ride that is sure to leave its mark on your psyche. I have seen many of the movies in this franchise and know that they are not only visually stunning but also full of incredible stories but I do not think I am going to like this movie.

I have read comments from a lot of people that they are going to like it because of a few things and that is true – at first there isn't much to do other than the fights from previous. However, after about 20 minutes of fighting, there isn't really anything more left to do. You can't choose where the villains, the rebels, the humans and even the creatures fall from. You don't really get a chance to make any progress; but let's face it, Hollywood can't be completely original each and every time.

After the initial fight sequence, you can just follow the story which takes a while to get started. Things you will see are things you have already seen: the human rebels that were killed by the creatures so that the humans can escape the planet Earth, an accident that results in a human being turning into a monster and more. These things are so familiar that they seem almost forced into it; which is just wrong because the last movie made a point of showing that these themes are in place.

You begin the movie with a bunch of people who are stuck on the ship that was supposed to take them off of the planet Earth, including a guy, "The Captain" who tries to find the way back home but cannot move. The story goes in a few different directions and we don't quite get to know anything about them until about three quarters in – when the movie is all about the humans and monsters, leaving us with very little to be interested with. The movie will pick up once we get to meet some other people and it is obvious that they will be important.

It is hard to give a good description of the new film; it changes up the formula every time and it is quite hard to predict how the next film in the series will go. There's a lot of fight scenes as we have already seen from each movie and the monsters are really scary. We already have all the characters that were in the earlier movies so by the time the movie begins, we are already familiar with all of them and will have a fun ride all the way through. That kind of fun ride has never been made before.

With so many familiar sights and sounds throughout the movie, it feels like it almost has the feeling of something from the 1980s. The first film came out over 30 years ago so people have had time to forget what it looked like and what it felt like. The new one will no doubt bring some of these nostalgic feelings but this is just because the movie has taken so long to come out, so it makes sense that the nostalgia will be present. The action sequence with these characters having to fight and shoot at each other, especially in the second half will have you feeling that you are watching an 80s movie on your couch.

The character acting is on par with the best from all the previous movies. I have never seen so many different characters that are all likable and you can tell that they are all on the same level. You don't know who the good guys are or who is the baddie and you have to do a lot of guessing. I don't think people will be able to stop laughing to the film because it is just so much fun to watch. With all the blood and the gore, it is pretty obvious what kind of film this is.

It is not a new film but a continuation to films that started back in 1987. The action scenes are so fast and the characters on the screen seem so real that you can't help but laugh as you watch. The best part is that there doesn't seem to be any real story until the second half. There is a reason why this film has stayed in storage for the past 30 years and it has nothing to do with the story itself – it has everything to do with the cast and the actors. These people were all great at acting and their performances are so memorable.

The movie is definitely not for everyone – I can't really say what the film could have been if it didn't cost a whole lot of money. However, as many people have stated, it is the best one ever and can give you some great laughs and some amazing memories. The fact that it takes place in a different galaxy does the writing justice and if you are a fan of the earlier movies this could be for you.<|endoftext|>The first three days of my trip, I went off to the mountains and just walked

The FBI has has is working on new methods to monitor social media accounts, including the use of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts, in a bid to investigate domestic terror threats.

"All of this information flows through social media, and it is something we are paying a lot of attention to," FBI director James Comey said at an event on Thursday in San Francisco. "We have some big ideas in the works for how we can do things better on the information and the intelligence from these social media sites."

The FBI has been monitoring social media since the Boston bombings in 2013. The bureau's intelligence director at the time was FBI veteran John Negroponte, who resigned from his post in 1999 to protest government surveillance of U.S. citizens.

"We will monitor everything, everything," Comey said of the threats. "At some point, every society has to make a choice between being a free society or not being free."

Comey said the bureau was also looking into whether terrorist groups should be more savvy with social media than they are, with the goal of deterring lone actors from carrying out attacks against the United States.<|endoftext|>The new version of the Android 8 Oreo beta has already hit the hands of the OnePlus 3 and in addition to the usual bug fixes, there are also new bug fixes. This time around it is specifically addressed a crash that could happen in various applications on the OnePlus 3 when using the fingerprint reader to unlock the phone. On previous ROMs this issue was present but the fix was to include a full unlock screen with the fingerprint.

Not anymore.

The latest beta update includes a full unlock option without having to switch between various home screens, something that was previously available with a long press. This is the same way Android 7.1 added in a swipe from right to top shortcut when using fingerprint readers – a good solution though not as efficient as something like a touchless unlock app like Easy Unlock.

There is one new fix for another crash that could happen when the OnePlus 3's camera app was opened. That said it is not the culprit here, rather the camera's audio is often out of sync with the time it is captured and that could potentially lead to a crash.

There is a new version of OnePlus' OTA utility that is also available in the beta, and it has an option to check for and download the updated OTA files. This OTA utility has been available in the past but it will now also work with the OnePlus 3 Beta Software, meaning that it will update the OnePlus 3 in case something goes wrong.

The update also includes a fix for some weird behaviour on the OnePlus 3 when used by someone who uses the OnePlus 3 Pro but doesn't have the OP3. When this happens the software will prompt the user to download the appropriate version of OTA, as opposed to automatically downloading the latest OTA from OnePlus.

As always, you will also have access to OnePlus' official software if you own the OnePlus 3; just tap the "More" button on the lock screen when your phone is locked for the last time and then select "More". The OTA files will then be offered for download.<|endoftext|>About "The Great Divide"

The first song on Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the main theme is a variation or addition to "New Slaves". The main idea is that even though the person you love most still believes that you are "better" than them but in fact they were just following their heart which is how it always should be. Kanye also raps about the love that he has for his family, friends and the woman he is currently with. Despite this, Kanye never stops questioning, always having new questions to ask himself like his parents and what it truly means to love yourself.

In interviews, Kanye referred to this song as "the dark part of the album."

The first verse is also the opening of Kanye's 2011 single (Kanye West, Vampire Sex Party Remix) with the title "New Slaves", which can be considered a sequel to this (after the "New Slaves" version of the music video was released).<|endoftext|>A young man has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting an elderly woman while she was trying to make her way home from work.

Michael Broussard, 22, was arrested on May 7 on the charge of sexual assault on an elderly victim and appeared in court today.

The court heard that the incident happened after Broussard's vehicle had blocked the woman's path and she tried to get out to use the phone, then she was attacked.

Defence lawyers sought treatment for the "traumatic and profound harm" of the attack and Broussard was released on the condition he stay away from the elderly victim.

According to the victim's statement, she had gone to work for the Health and Community Services in downtown Toronto the day before last and had returned to her home at around midnight. It was then that Broussard allegedly

Hillary Clinton announced her intentions to run for president in 2020 — but will go in a slightly different direction than the Clintons of recent decades.

During an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Wednesday, Clinton, 74, said her campaign will focus on getting women, young people and other Americans involved in politics. And she said "you can do that in any party" should she lose for the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Story Continued Below

"The way I think about this campaign and this campaign now is I am running a campaign of new ideas," Clinton said on "Morning Joe". "And so I am going to talk about a lot of different topics and I am going to say, 'What really matters in that election, who have I heard from, what is the agenda of the Democratic Party? And then I am going to say, 'Vote for me.'"

Clinton called her primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders a "credible Democratic candidate," as well as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) a "very credible Democratic governors."

She also referenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.), who has been tapped by Sanders's campaign to be the vice presidential running mate.

"Elizabeth Warren is a very credible Democratic candidate to be vice president," Clinton said during the roundtable discussion on Wednesday. "I want to see the Democratic Party and progressive forces, young people, get involved all over.

"The reason why I started this campaign is because there were so many people out there who said 'We should take Bernie Sanders's campaign seriously. What he is saying is absolutely right.' I want to take it to a real place and I think you can do that in any party."

Clinton also talked about the Republican White House: "I think there is an emerging understanding that we need to have a much tougher response to the threats that we face. [But] I think it is going to be hard to get a really strong majority without a good working partisan majority."

She said she hopes to win in a presidential year in which there is an open Republican Senate: "But I think the most important thing for this country in 2020 is to put some Democrats in charge of Congress. I've met a lot of them. I'd like to have their votes."<|endoftext|>A man found hanging himself in his South Florida home late Wednesday morning will be brought to Orlando to receive an award recognizing outstanding police work.

The man, who identified himself as "Buddy," was found hanging in his apartment at the St. Augustine Village apartment complex off S.C. 940 near St. Augustine on Wednesday. The Palm Beach County medical examiner identified the man in a preliminary autopsy report as 25-year-old Bobby Lee Scott, of Tampa.

Authorities said Scott's family has been contacted by a hospital administrator regarding the death. The family is being interviewed by authorities, according to officials.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement Major Crimes Unit detectives were at the apartment complex Wednesday morning trying to assess the scene and the scene at St. Augustine Village Apartments. They said the apartment building was closed during the investigation but reopened at 8:30 a.m.

According to a news release sent out Wednesday morning, Scott's death will be investigated as a homicide based on a finding of suicide that led investigators to believe Scott had been dead for several days before his body was discovered Wednesday morning. The release said Scott's body showed evidence of a struggle. It appeared he may have been tied up. A suicide note was found in Scott's pocket, authorities said.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office homicide unit is handling the ongoing investigation.

Durham-born, New York-based construction firm Pinnacle Real Estate Partners has partnered with Habitat for Humanity as the developer of the $60 million, mixed-income development. The development would also include retail on the first two levels, which also will include apartments, and will create a central plaza.

Habitat for Humanity is currently building four residential and commercial projects—including two at 709 North Davidson Ave.—in the same area, according to Habitat for Humanity's website.

How much would you pay for a piece of land that was as far away as Mexico in the United States, and is a million miles away from Los Angeles? If you are a Chinese investor the answer is the same. In a scheme that was uncovered by the Wall Street Journal, a New York real estate investor is trying to do an expensive reverse takeover of one of Trump's golf courses—the latest attempt by Chinese investors to buy into the U.S. real estate market.

China's interest in buying real estate in the U.S. has long been a subject of fascination for foreign investors, but few have tried such a large scale buyout of another country's property. The Chinese government has allowed foreigners to buy large tracts of American land with the intention of selling them at a later date to foreign investors—a technique known colloquially as "land-grabbing," the Journal says.

While no official record has been made available and the exact size of the buyout, the price is estimated to be around $150 million.

That price doesn't even come close to the Trump course, the only Trump property the Journal notes that Beijing has expressed interest in buying—an estimated $18-30 million of it, according to sources familiar with the matter.

While the Trump course hasn't been the focus of Chinese interest since Donald Trump was elected, Beijing's interest is clear. The Trump property's owners, the US-listed developer CIM Group, have reportedly said they are working on a plan to sell it to mainland clients, although one Chinese newspaper reported that the sale may be delayed as Trump deals with a series of corruption charges at home.<|endoftext|>About

"I'm gonna give you $20,000 and let you pick any song from the radio that sounds good and I'll pay you $2,500 for every copy sold until that day. Do whatever you feel." - Jay-Z from Back to Back to Back

We at Back to Back to Back created this concept in an attempt to change radio and bring back the original feeling of listening. We took the best songs in the world, and put them in a single box. We call it the Playlist & Soundtrack Box and the one box contains 50 songs for $20,000. Our goal is to make the Box something that every hip-hop artist could own. It is not just any box. The Box will look like a hip-hop classic album. It will hold 10 copies of a record, but only allow two to be played at the same time. We plan on creating the first production box in the hip-hop industry. The Playlist & Soundtrack Box will feature classic hip-hop like Run-D.M.C.'s A Better Tomorrow, Jay-Z's The Saga Continues and 50 Cent's Life After Death & The Rise & Fall of Cash Money/Slim's 50th Anniversary Collection by Nas, EPMD, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill. It will take you back to a time when there was only one box and you could only get the one song you wanted to hear.

One artist who has agreed to do the box for us is Lil Wayne, who was featured on the first Playlist & Soundtrack Box.

We believe that the Box is going to bring back the feeling of the music industry. It is going to be a music collector's dream and one we know would be appreciated by even the most hardcore listeners out there. The music industry needs that kind of incentive, and our mission is to bring a new wave of playlists back to the masses.

We are asking for your support.

Please share our campaign to the best of your abilities.

Thank you and Thank you Lil Wayne.

The Washington Redskins have been pretty good at securing the No. 1 overall pick the last two seasons. When a quarterback is taken, fans like the promise of a franchise-changing signal-caller. But the Redskins may have to rethink that strategy if Washington can't retain Robert Griffin III.

According to Sports Illustrated's Peter King, Washington is "preparing a third-round offer" to retain its starting quarterback, who will become a free agent July 15.

The Redskins are one of the most aggressive teams at finding high-profile quarterbacks and it's not that long ago that Griffin was perceived as a player who could "win right away." Instead, Griffin has been an inconsistent, underachieving starter who has thrown six interceptions and averaged a whopping 5.7 yards per carry in four seasons since turning pro in 2012.

Griffin isn't the only veteran quarterback who will hit free agency in 2015. In fact, a half-dozen teams could look for an upgrade behind the wheel by March.

The top of the market may already be set in stone. Matt Moore and Jay Cutler are out of options, and Ryan Fitzpatrick is still going strong as one of the NFL's best backups at 35 years old. Andy Dalton is 33 and Alex Smith can be counted on to lead the Chiefs to another championship, but both signal-callers are coming off disappointing seasons.

The Redskins have two picks in the first three rounds of the draft, and are a couple of picks from the top of the second round. That gives them an opportunity to upgrade the position, but they'll also need someone to step up in 2013.

At 26 years old, Griffin will be entering the prime of his career and has two more years of guaranteed money left on his contract. In 2013, he should be considered a veteran-caliber quarterback because that's what he'll be for the majority of his career. The team would be wise to secure his services the moment they can.

The following letter is in response to the news that the Department of Homeland Security was granted an extension to implement and enforce our immigration laws. These laws were enacted in an attempt to stop the illegal immigration invasion that was causing so much harm to our nation. The law does not cover all illegal immigrants, but it is generally recognized as a key piece of our immigration enforcement.

We have not been here for the last fifteen years, and while there have been many good provisions and improvements, our immigration system is still broken. This letter addresses both aspects of our immigration system.

1. Immigration Enforcement:

We strongly support the efforts of our Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to do their jobs to maintain public safety. We support President Barack Obama's administration efforts to identify, identify, target and arrest members of criminal gangs who have come here illegally and are hurting both the lives and the wages of our countrymen. However, our current immigration system allows these gang members and others to be able to freely enter our country without undergoing a background check and without fear. President Obama's executive order and previous actions taken by the previous administration have made our border more secure from illegal migration, however, the system still allows for these type of people to become citizens without even having a background check or a check from ICE.

2. Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

TPS covers countries outside of the US, which includes a number of Central and South American countries. The current program was signed into law in 1996 by then President Bill Clinton and continues to be implemented.

It is critical that the program be changed in some way to protect those who are living here because of this country's immigration laws. For example, we need protections to ensure that people from countries with very low rates of immigration do not receive TPS. We also need more resources and a more streamlined process in which people from low-skilled countries can apply at first.

3. Immigration Visas:

The Department must use its discretion to make sure that those receiving any benefits received in violation of our immigration laws are actually in the country.

4. Border Security and Immigration:

We support President Obama's efforts to stop the illegal immigration into the US and to have the US government enforce our immigration laws. We also support President Obama's announcement that he will stop deporting those who have been ordered removed by a judge.

We also believe, however, that if the Administration is serious about solving our border security and immigration problems that they should also use their discretion to make sure that those receiving any benefits received in violation of our immigration laws are actually in the country.

We encourage the Administration to ensure that they have the resources necessary to ensure that people in the country illegally can't use their TPS status to remain here legally—and to do so quickly when they are encountered.

5. Border Security:

The Border Patrol and Border Control should be given the resources necessary to patrol all borders across the country. President Obama was right to propose a major increase in border security when he was running for President because it means fewer people can stay to illegally immigrate into our country.

We also support the increased funding needed to enforce existing immigration laws and continue to build on the efforts already made to secure our borders.

We appreciate the efforts by President Obama and his administration to create a much safer and more secure border. However, Congress must ensure that President Obama's actions regarding border security funding are not undermined or ignored.

6. National Security and Immigration:

We would support President Obama's efforts to put pressure on our allies to stop accepting people who have not been vetted. We are also opposed to any changes to the United Nations refugee resettlement program. That program helps millions of innocent men, women and children escape terror and persecution and live and call their home a secure place to try and rebuild a better life.

Additionally, we support President Obama's actions to reduce the flow of illegal immigration, which has devastated communities, caused a huge increase in criminal activity and has impacted wages and jobs across this country for decades. We believe, however, that if the Administration is serious about stopping illegal immigration across our border and enforcing our immigration laws, they should use their discretion and give these families the opportunity to get right with the law.

We would also like to see better funding for our border security, increased support for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the removal of wasteful funds from other government agencies to make sure that they focus on border security.

7. Public Safety:

We are especially concerned that the Department of Homeland Security's ability to secure our nation's borders is severely challenged. We are also disappointed that the immigration status of foreign nationals was not fully investigated during the Boston Marathon bombings, despite information suggesting that the suspects had entered the US illegally.

Although DHS has already put in place many steps to ensure the security and integrity of immigration documents, these steps are not enough. The Department requires a lot more resources to

This year we're bringing a new set of characters to the world of the Witcher. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings – Hearts of Stone, will be our first expansion for The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. This expansion introduces the Blood & Wine storyline, which features a new adventure story that puts Geralt in control of a royal family and explores the conflicts of an age long ago when the nobles, the peasants, and the tribes all united against the Wild Hunt.

Blood & Wine is a story from the perspective of the heir to one of the most important kingdoms in Northern Europe, the Kingdom of Toussaint. As your character progresses through a story spanning the course of The Witcher 2, they start the game with the knowledge that their father, King Foltest, is the sole survivor of a horrific event during the War of the First Lantern.

The game is designed with this new knowledge of Toussaint's past in mind, leading us to create a game world that tells a story set in the same world but which offers unique possibilities for Geralt's progression that no other similar experience has before.

The player will now be able to control a family of three members and a horse. Toussaint includes three different districts – the northern province of Arden, the southern province of Novigrad and the southern city-state of Velen – as well as a variety of additional content such as dungeons, mini-games, mini-adventures and adventures.

For the first time in any Witcher game, our new character-building system and a deep character customization feature are introduced as part of the game, allowing the player to choose the appearance and skills of each of his two main characters without losing any of the gameplay benefits.

Blood & Wine will be available in September for PlayStation 3 / Xbox 360 and on October 30th for PC.<|endoftext|>The last time my father tried to stop me from sleeping on the couch I fell asleep to the TV while he made dinner. He was tired. That's what kids do when they're not working.

The TV was on when the doorbell rang. I thought it was that one uncle again that always wanted to show me his car. I opened the door to see a man in my dad's uniform.

"What can I get you?" I wanted to ask. I always wanted to ask. Because the man took his hat off the table and put it on. This may have been a guy in my dad's uniform, but they didn't look like the people from that day with the big gold star in the corner. They didn't have hats anymore. They all had them when they were killed.

That was the time someone on my dad's team died. So this man had a nice hat with feathers in it, and it looked expensive on a man who worked for our family. "Your uniform." I'd heard that line a thousand times. No matter what my dad's orders, I wasn't supposed to sleep on the couch. The man left, not saying anything.

It wasn't the first time I'd heard it: "Your uniform."

I turned on the TV to see if I could catch the last of the news. I never bothered.

I was asleep the first night I got a chance. The family went on vacation. I went to bed.

It was cold. I heard my Dad's voice. Not the voice I knew, the one that would warn me if I heard gunshots in the distance. The one that would explain why I didn't hear my name being called on the phone. "Geraldo?"

"My name is Geraldo," I told him.

"Can I put my hat down like I used to?" Maybe this was a different Geraldo? Maybe I could make him not kill my family. "I really don't want my hat on again."

"Just get it over here, please. Come on."

I did what he asked. Even after my Mom had made me put it on. I was supposed to sleep on the couch, and I got so tired that I thought my hair might fall out.

I went on the road trip with Dad and told my Mom I was going to watch TV. I thought it was all going to be so normal, like my friends got married and I went to the beach. But I'd had the TV since I was old enough to remember, and it was the one thing that kept my sanity. I needed the TV like I needed a bath.

The family went on vacation, and everyone took a shower in the family car. Geraldo got in.

"Where you going, gee whiz?" He didn't wait for my answer, so I hopped in the chair between his legs. "Where you going? What are you going to do? Where you gonna live? Where you gonna live? You're getting married soon, Geraldo. You're going
======================================== SAMPLE 465 ========================================
The following letter was sent to The Guardian by two anonymous women from various different organisations of varying backgrounds. They wish to remain anonymous for obvious reasons.

We are members of the Women's Equality Party, and our party organiser, Sue Perkins, is currently writing a feminist manifesto, which is a key part of this. The manifesto is being completed at the moment, and while we are still in the process, it has been decided that this letter is a letter we do not want published. It is not designed as a direct attack, but does raise some legitimate questions, which we are happy to discuss at length if people are interested.

We are not members of any particular political party, but the politics we are talking about are universal and part of the mainstream. In the US and UK, the majority of the politicians and government leaders in our societies are men. If we look at the role of women in these societies at a macro-level – in the workplace – we find that there are many structural advantages afforded to men, to be perfectly frank. For example, many workplaces do not provide for adequate break times, childcare facilities, or access to equal pay for equal work; we have seen a dramatic rise in men in the workforce over the past 100 years, and this shift has in turn made most women redundant. We are talking at a micro level, here, but the overall effects of this are that the bulk of the population's financial security and economic well-being is dependent on the gender of the main breadwinner, and when the majority of our work falls to men, we do not have the legal right to demand our fair share.

We live in an extremely unequal society, and the gap between rich and poor is even wider. We know that the gender pay gap tends to be even bigger for people who come from upper-income households, for women in particular. This means that the fact that women earn less than men doesn't mean that they are being paid less; it actually means that their value in the workplace has decreased to a greater extent because of the structural disadvantages they have relative to men.

Women are also more likely to be the main carer for children under 18. This means that we, as parents, have greater responsibilities – both mental and financial – than our male counterparts. This is not a sexist issue; it is human.

We are feminists. We believe that women's equality is an inalienable human right; that men should not profit from this unequal balance of power in the workplace or society any more than they did at any previous stage of social evolution. Feminism has always had something to say against the social inequality caused by institutionalised gender inequality. It calls us to recognise that power is not the goal of male dominance; that it is the power of women to demand control over their own bodies and their own futures. We are proud of the feminist movement that arose in the 1960s, and which continues to grow, with the first all-women's conference taking place this time in London. It is our hope that this letter might contribute to discussion regarding the need for further social reforms aimed at correcting these inequalities, if the feminist movement is to continue to remain relevant.

Our concerns about gender inequality have been raised often, and often by those who claim to support it. We want to challenge the prevailing view that feminist movements are always 'anti-men', or that any particular action it takes is aimed at creating conditions where women are 'equal' to men. When people call for more equality for women, they almost always mean that the rights and freedoms that men enjoy should be extended to women as well; that men should be free to pursue work, careers, and life in whatever manner they see fit.

We have heard this in recent weeks with the growing focus surrounding equality legislation, with some MPs and activists claiming that we must create "lad's rights" legislation: i.e. laws which allow men to "have their cake and eat it". We are not against any particular outcome that the law could bring about, we are just against those who would create legal incentives.

Some feminists seek to 'take back' the workplace by allowing women to more easily claim equal pay for equal work (i.e. the 'sexism' argument). We disagree, because we do not see how a workplace should be defined any longer; a place for work, a place for sex, a place for male supremacy. It needs to be a place for human beings, not men. It should be a place for men to work and live and create, and not a place where women are expected to be submissive, to be protected only from violence and abuse.

In an interview for this film, Rebecca West said: "I don't want the right of women to do anything… to be able to sit at home and be a homemaker. I don't want women to be able to be an active member of society. That is what gives women their power – their agency."

The National Institutes of Health will start paying a new price per month to the government for the drugs used to treat patients diagnosed with metastatic brain cancer, setting the price at $2,000 for an 11-month treatment.

The cost of the drugs, known as CTL019, is the latest to rise under a 2012 law that allowed government-sponsored research on the drugs. The law, known as the BRAIN Act, aims to encourage researchers to find new ways to fight brain disorders, but some say the law has been too costly and cumbersome to achieve its goals.

Some lawmakers called for an end to the government-sponsored drug research this year. But some lawmakers, including some Republicans — who control Congress — and Democrats, are still defending the law, and the cost of the research.

"If you want to fight brain cancer, you must understand that the drugs that are used are only part of the answer," said Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia and an original author of the law. "We must take the next step, and that is to bring down the price of life-saving medicines to those that many Americans can afford."


Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which funds most of the BRAIN Act research, said the cost of CTL019 is similar to the cost of other medications that the agency administers. CTL019 is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of the disease that causes a large proportion of patients with advanced cancers to die within six months. The average price of the drug in the United States is $1,092 a month.

"The only thing we can control on that is the clinical trial costs for all of our investigational drugs, the way the drug is approved," Ludwig said. "It's what we can control that affects what we pay in the U.S. dollar."

Some experts suggest reducing the cost of the drug by lowering its effectiveness and requiring patients to take it for more than 10 months.


"This price hike will make access to CTL019 far more expensive, which will have a chilling effect on the development of new medicines for brain tumors," said Michael Steinberg, director of the health law program at the Center for Studying Drug Development at the law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel.

CDR Medical, which makes CTL019, has said in the past the drug was more effective than some medications available on the market.

The company said that by 2015, 10 other drugs will begin competing for the same market that CTL019 will.

"If you look at [our competitors], they are priced far higher. The big question is just why they're not pricing themselves anywhere near CTL019," said Darshini Singh Bhandari, a spokeswoman for CCDDR Medical.

Dr. Michael Siegel, chief of the division of glioblastoma research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), said it appears the cancer is resistant to standard drugs, but some are developing options for treatment.<|endoftext|>If you're into music at all, you've probably heard of The Weeknd, and if you don't, you really should. The Weeknd made his way to the mainstream in 2015's "Can't Feel My Face." It's hard to pick just one song for this list, but let's just say this was the year the Weeknd made every year at the top of the Billboard 200.

Now, on the heels of breaking his own record with his third album Starboy, The Weeknd takes things to the next level with his latest album Beauty Behind The Madness, due September 30th.

Listen to the new music video for "I Feel It Coming" below, which features the Weeknd's sister-in-law, Talinda Williams, alongside him.

This isn't a story you're likely to hear very often these days, but it could lead to a revolution in cycling training.

A group of researchers from Bristol University and the University of the West of England have developed an innovative way to improve your cycling biomechanics.

In what they say is a first for cycling, an aerodynamic cycle design is to be used as a training guide for road cyclists. The research team at Bristol and West of England have developed and tested their 'aerodynamic cycle design'. It is designed to increase the cyclist's aerodynamic efficiency by keeping the cyclist's center of gravity low, and to help the cyclist stay more upright, the team say.

The study involved the use of a cycle simulator, which uses the rider's body form as the basis for a three dimensional computer model. The team used the computer model to design how all of the human motions

In October, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit rejected Apple's attempt to throw out a jury verdict that was handed down last year that found the company liable to compensate former supplier Pegatron for its role in the so-called 'Scribot defect.'

Pegatron's lawyer argued that Apple should have to pay the company's lawyers' fees for their work, but the court rejected those arguments in favor of a more measured approach that could see Apple pay a fraction of the actual damages.

After all, Apple had paid Pegatron to build the iPod touch for just $39.95, and the company has long since sold them away. As a result, the court ruled:

Apple's actions are in fact "totally insignificant in light of the totality of the relationship and history between the parties over the last decade, both during and after which the parties have shared in an astonishingly low percentage of the total profits." Therefore, "in light of their lack of relationship, there is no basis for this court to award Pegatron damages for these damages, which would be excessive, but for the fact that the relationship was so negligible and the damages so minimal as to amount to nothing."

Apple isn't the only company under scrutiny after a jury failed to find it liable for allegedly helping cause the death of a teenage worker who worked for Apple's supplier, Apple-supplier Pegatron.

The Associated Press has obtained an image of a memo, dated July 27, 2005, sent to Apple CEO Steve Jobs that reportedly revealed that Apple's suppliers were subject to "systematic anti-union activities" at the time, with Pegatron "the biggest target." As a result, "many suppliers are afraid to talk to us about anything other than the high union costs involved." The memo allegedly went on to say that Apple would "have a lot to lose" if it "suddenly had to pay some of the thousands of dollars we pay each consultant for their opinions about how to respond to labor questions." Apple has denied that the memo ever existed.

The AP also has obtained internal documents that show that Apple and its subsidiaries "paid millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation" to top union officials, according to "industry documents and a person with direct knowledge of the arrangements... The documents indicate that the payments were in addition to any cash bonuses the companies paid to workers for going on strike."

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<|endoftext|>The first two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who had access to Hillary Clinton's unsecured personal email account, including those who were told to "strip and mask" classified emails, resigned on Wednesday.

The announcement comes after a Washington Post report revealed Clinton's private server contained classified information, including the names of CIA officers involved in the hunt for Bin Laden, and other sensitive details.

The Washington Post also said three State Department IT personnel were required to "strip and mask" the contents of Clinton's personal email account so that they would not see it.

The Post report cited interviews with the three aides and an internal State Department audit of more than 31,000 emails Clinton sent during her first eight months as secretary of state.

Clinton herself had been aware that there was classified information in her emails, though she told the FBI that she did not "recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system" at the time. Clinton did delete more than 30,000 emails from her personal server before handing that over to the State Department for preservation.

Despite this, at least two aides whose access to Clinton's unsecured server was limited have been shown to have mishandled classified information, and that includes Bryan Pagliano, who set up Clinton's server, and Huma Abedin, who is Clinton's close aide and a confidante.

Pagliano claimed he had not done any work related to work connected to Clinton's State Department. Abedin was found to have provided "work-related" services in an email about her "favorite places to shop" in Washington.

Pagliano, who was granted immunity by the Justice Department as part of its investigation into Clinton's email scandal, did receive a "show cause" letter in May from the FBI requesting he provide information concerning certain email systems that he says are used by Platte River Networks, an IT firm with ties to Clinton's campaign.

An attorney for Clinton has insisted that her use of a private server while secretary of state was "authorized by the Department of State. And the State Department confirmed that."

"No one even knew the server was being used by Clinton until the New York Times wrote about it," Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings said in a statement.

"And now, after this FBI report, all the evidence reveals that, instead of operating solely for personal convenience, this machine was being used to conduct official business."

Cummings said if Clinton did use a private server for

Quick Walkthrough [ edit ]

Detailed Walkthrough [ edit ]

Stuck in the Tombstone Quarry [ edit ]

The location of the tombstone quarry is in the northwest corner of the map. At the bottom of the quarry on the west side of the quarry you will find a large rock that is difficult to climb. The stone has an open section on one side, which has enough exposed wooden beams to drop down through. However, the other side is protected by a ledge that is too high to climb out of.

The best place to go first is the ledge, and jump down onto the second level of rock. Make sure to grab onto the wooden beams. This will enable you to reach the first level of stone, which is not protected by the ledge, and reach the rock floor which is completely protected by the ledge. As you jump up the ledge you will notice that the lower portion of the rock and the area just beneath your feet is covered in boulders.

A Small-Trouble Solution [ edit ]

After getting past the boulder wall, grab the wooden beam as quickly as possible, and drop down to the bottom of the large rock ledge. If you fall below the level where the stone floor is protected from the ledge by the edge of the large rock ledge, your fall will kill you. Use the wooden beam on the exposed wooden beam under the platform; use it as a stepping stone for those who have no tools. This way allows you to jump across the exposed, large rock ledge and reach the area below where the ladder leads out.

Use the lower platform. To the left is a stone ladder. To the right is a door leading south. There is a stone statue on the first floor level of the area. There is also a lever on the lower level in a chest. Pull the lever when you are ready to go through the door, and head to the south-southwest exit door.

Head out on the wooden beams, then drop down to the ledge. Head to the north-west, and follow the stone passage until you reach a ramp. Follow the ramp to the south and you will come to a platform. There is a chest below you; retrieve the key from the chest to complete the quest. Note that the chest is locked and that a key will be needed to open it.

Notes [ edit ]

If you are not wearing any armor and do not have the Sneak perk, you are unable to complete this quest, as the chest is protected by a locked wooden beam. However, to get out of the situation without using any tools, simply run as quickly as possible away from the pillar the chest is on, avoiding the beam. The beam should be above the chest and will not damage you. Note that the beam in the chest may be replaced by the stone on the second level of the stone platform upon getting past the wooden beam.

There are several different ways to get to the exit to the tombstone quarry. The easiest strategy is the jump to the ledge with the exposed wooden beam. From there, follow the rock passage until you reach the metal door. This is possible by jumping off the lower edge of the metal door and running to the west of the door. Alternatively, there is a shortcut that requires no keys, but it will require you to travel a couple of miles south-southwest of Riften. You can do this by traveling to the village of Winterhold and then traveling along the Riverwood road to the small bridge (one block north of the Riften Watch Tower) which crosses the river. Once on the bridge, walk south a short distance to a wooden walkway and walk to the end of the walkway (you can get back on the walkway by approaching the stone platform from the south and facing north). Use the metal door nearby to exit Winterhold, and you will have traveled a total of about 2 miles by the time you come to Riften. You should have plenty of experience running, especially if you use the Whirlwind Sprint shout; you shouldn't have any trouble reaching Riften. This method also works through the doors on the northern side of the stone platform and into the tombstone quarry.

The tombstone quarry is accessible to everyone with a skill of 17 in the Alteration skill and the ability to cast Alteration spells. This is not the case with the quest, "Forgotten Wisdom".

During the quest you may see a group of Nordic skeletons in front of the stone ledge. This is a harmless illusion - the skeletons do not count towards the quest.

A lot of people are still struggling with the meaning of the words "downtrend" and "upswing" when looking at the performance by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For example, an article earlier this week on CNBC's "Fast Money" blog called Dow: A U.S. Downtrend and Not an Upward Trend.

My research, along with a bit of analysis, suggests that the most accurate way to define Dow's downtrend is the fact that it happened in the late 1930s:

And yes, the graph below shows the Dow's annualized gain from 1929 to 1939. If we were using a simple up-and-down trend to measure Dow's performance since then, Dow would have moved from a high in 1929 to near the end of World War II in 1944. Dow would then have started a new up-and-down pattern, with the dot above 1938, but would subsequently lose its way again.

The fact is, the Dow's performance since then, along with the long-term uptrend, is exactly what a market uptrend and downtrend look like. When Dow is up (or down), it's due to the upward movement of the market. The downtrend, on the other hand, is due to market forces such as the decline in the supply of energy, or the introduction of new products, or other cyclical forces. Dow is still in its up-and-down downtrend at the moment, but we might expect to see the Dow slowly moving back into the downtrend once the first quarter is over.

One final note. When we first covered this topic back in April, I noted that the Dow was more likely to come back up (in an uptrend) than down (in a downtrend). At the time, I mentioned that Dow might be more vulnerable to a short-term downturn, but I was still willing to hold Dow in my portfolio. I'm no longer willing to make that claim.<|endoftext|>About

The original game for our Kickstarter campaign! This is for the original 2.5 inch die game "Bible Wars" and the expansions "Chronicles" and "Homes".

We will provide these for free once that project is funded.

The first expansion "Chronicles" is now completed! We are just finalizing the artwork so that we could finish the game with a great cover. We are also making some small changes in the rules so that the game can fit more of the 8mm die as well. We are also currently making adjustments to the card numbers as we were unable to get these as they were initially ordered.

The second expansion "Homes" is also completed! We are just making minor changes to the artwork now that its done. A small change to game play as well.

The final set of "Homes" cards are finished and ready for shipment. Once they are ready, we will ship out the remaining sets and be done with the initial orders. Once again, we will be providing these for free once the Kickstarter project is funded.

This second read did not disappoint: There's so much to love.


I first saw the book in the late summer of 2015 about 20,000 miles away—in Turkey, where I was on my way to learn how to be a doctor. In my spare time I was reading the "real" medical literature with the hopes that some of it would find an application to my studies at the University of Chicago. However, the book I was reading was, with the exception of one character, not an actual medical book. It was The Great Pandemic by Peter Beaumont, who has come a long way since that first reading. His writing is crisp, clean, and fast-paced; his characters are vivid and believable. Even the prose, written in the third person, is crisp and succinct, and his sentences are always a great use of ellipses.


There is so much in "The Great Pandemic" that I haven't yet fully wrapped my head around. I still don't know if Peter is doing fiction from a medical perspective or if he's just doing the same thing science fiction writers have always done—writing about the present but with magic-based, future-tech sci fi elements woven in.


In any case, these "realistic" elements of the book really do add to and enhance the story. Beaumont is so deft when it comes to pacing, and the way he draws you into the book gives you a sense that there's something greater that's going on here--at a level we've never experienced; you become a part of the story. It's almost like being a part of a movie.

Following one of the league's best regular seasons last year under former Capitals coach Adam Oates, and one of the team's most disappointing playoffs, Trotz is facing an uphill battle in his third season on the job, as the Capitals have struggled since he took over for Bruce Boudreau.

Washington has won only six of its 27 games, which includes a loss in its most recent contest, and has now lost eight of their last nine contests.

Oates, who was fired midway through the season by Washington, posted a 508-424-86 (.605) record (.533 winning percentage) in his last 16 games, including an 18-7-3 mark (.733 winning percentage) in those games that was good enough to lead the Capitals to the Presidents' Trophy for the most victories in the Metro Division in 2014-15. Washington ended up finishing in the top-three in the division, but missed the playoffs altogether.

"It is something new that he's brought to Washington," Capitals forward Troy Brouwer said of Trotz after the team was swept at home by the New York Islanders on Saturday. "He doesn't say much, but he's done a great job of getting the guys in the right rhythm and stuff like that."

With Trotz hired, it wasn't immediately clear who would take over as Washington's coach following Oates' dismissal.

Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Phil Kessel all said recently that they'd be interested in remaining with the organization beyond this season if there was a possibility of another playoff run coming to Washington. Coach Barry Trotz has said he would like that to be the case, and is confident in his ability to turn things around.

Trotz joined the Capitals midway through the 2014-15 season and has only two weeks of coaching experience, having been promoted to the top job on Jan. 9. He helped lead Russia to two gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics before returning to his native Sweden for a coaching career.

He has appeared in a total of 38 career NHL games, with a record of 43-56-19. Trotz appeared in the Capitals' first playoff game in 2009, the postseason in 2008 and 2011, and the club's second round exit in 2010. He was the NHL's third most-winning coach in 2004 and 2005 with Nashville and Toronto, respectively, before landing in Washington. Trotz led the Predators to the Stanley Cup Final in 2005.<|endoftext|>The New York Times Magazine once published a list of the 50 most influential people in the world. The list is a testament to how powerful the idea of being "influential" can be.

Most of those people are people who've had a huge impact on the world and have lived extremely successful lives. It's a list that makes you want to write some books or become the next famous actor or politician.

The problem with the list is that it also makes you want to die.

The most popular item on the list is a picture of Steve Jobs. This is because he got on the list by being at least 10 times as influential as everyone else.

Jobs was, of course, very talented. He was also incredibly ambitious and highly driven. It's hard to imagine that any of that made him any less influential than almost everyone else on the list.

The problem is that he was also incredibly successful. To put it in perspective: There are two people on the list who have had twice as great of an impact in the world as Jobs.

There is one person on the list who is at least 10 times worse for influence as Steve Jobs.

For a long time, I have used the word "joke" to describe something that is absurdly stupid. One of the reasons for this has been because my mother taught me that there are things in life that are so ridiculous that you should think very, very hard about them before you make another joke about them. But a joke has come up that is, I think, about the last thing that my mother taught me when she learned the value of thinking hard. It's the joke that is so ridiculous—it is both utterly predictable and completely insane. It is the joke about a man who was convicted of murdering his wife, the mother of nine children—and for whom his victim's family and the police worked hard to have him sentenced to die. It's the joke about a state agency that has become so deeply embedded and powerful that it is now a part of the fabric of the society it regulates and regulates to protect and serve. It's the joke about a company that has created a culture in which employees are made to believe that it's their job to lie to customers, and the culture that was created was a culture of dishonesty. It's also the joke about a man who decided to give his life to the state.

The joke about the man who made a living killing his wife. Photo: AP

I have always thought, over the years, of how ridiculous that the state, in the name of justice, would put a man to death for a crime he supposedly should not have committed. But it occurred to me that it is actually possible, that people could seriously argue, that this was a just and reasonable sentence. If the judge were to rule that for someone like me, for example, who has never even had an impulse to murder anyone, that a death sentence was just and reasonable in the way that this man was sentenced, in my mind, he would be wrong. But I was not prepared to give up yet another hobby that I have had, to admit to myself that this is, in fact, the case.

I began doing more and more research into this case, looking at documents from the case. And in doing so I also began to look harder at the facts of the case, the evidence in the case. I saw that I was aghast at how, for what we now recognize were outrageous and unjustified claims, the defendant was convicted. So one day I opened up e-mails that I had not received from myself. And there it was--the e-mail from my mother. It was a long e-mail, but it told her story in a simple and clear and eloquent way. She wrote, "I know what you want to do. But the truth is you have done nothing to deserve this." She continued, "You have never killed anyone. You were not even convicted of any murder charges. It is beyond comprehension for a family who has lost eight members to murder or accident over the years, including you, to have you convicted of murder. It is beyond comprehension for you to claim that for this you have earned a death sentence. But as a matter of justice and fairness you must die in prison, or we will fight it until you are freed."

She concluded, "You are a man who has violated the fundamental human rights of a fellow human being, you are a criminal in the justice system on the rampage, you are not worthy of any mercy and, if you are ever released, you will kill again immediately." I felt a deep sense of despair. I also felt that this kind of experience—where you feel you are being lied to and betrayed and your fundamental human rights are being violated every second of the time for something that has never happened to you before—that you are so desperate to find any way of not being punished that you are willing to sacrifice everything.

It was at that place where I decided I needed to stop telling jokes.

I knew I wasn't the only person like me in this situation. It was easy to feel that way. I was talking about it with my friends and I was writing articles about it. And it was hard to come to terms with this fact that I had become the object of a joke. It wasn't right. It wasn't funny.

"It takes a special kind of person, a unique kind of person, to be in my position."

It took a special kind of person, a unique kind of person, to be in my position. I knew I had gone down a slippery slope—I had crossed the fine line. But in that situation, I felt this very deep sense of desperation that something might very well happen to me. It was the first time I felt the urge to take the action needed to change the outcome. I wanted justice. I wanted the justice system to get it right, to take the time to understand what had happened, to be willing to take a fresh look at the evidence.

As I began to rethink and examine all my feelings about the joke

The United States expressed "grave concerns" Sunday after Greek police briefly detained the chairman of a prominent Greek newspaper and two other journalists on charges of disseminating false news, calling for their immediate release.

The three men were detained Thursday evening on charges of being responsible for distributing false information after dozens of people stormed local TV stations and other buildings, attacking both the police and the demonstrators.

"We are very disturbed by these news reports and strongly condemn their publication, which have resulted in serious injuries and loss of life," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a regular news briefing.

"The Greek authorities should immediately release all journalists identified in this case, without unnecessary delay, and to ensure that any other charges are dropped against any individuals who have been unlawfully detained as a result of these violent incidents."

The United States has long supported Press Freedom around the world. But Nauert said U.S. government officials will continue to monitor the situation in Greece.

She also said the United States "welcomes the fact that the government in Athens is committed to preserving freedom of expression in this nation by reviewing and enacting legislation to clarify that criminal incitement to violence only applies to incidents of public violence and violent attacks against police officers, and does not apply to acts that do not occur in the open but rather are hidden or clandestine."

A protest against the newspaper and some of its senior journalists took place in Athens, Athens police said on Friday. The police chief said he was not aware of any casualties, but he added that about 400 protesters had been arrested.

The rioting and clashes came after a ruling party-led government, which had been in power since 2015, unveiled reforms to tighten media ownership rules in an effort to control and regulate a media increasingly dominated by the political right.<|endoftext|>After losing to Chelsea in Sunday's Carabao Cup final, Spurs made a big-name signing by sealing Dele Alli's £5.5m move to White Hart Lane.

Alli has played for England internationally and is now one of the most important players in the Tottenham team, as he can also play as a winger. The 23-year-old, who joined Spurs at the age of seven, will now be under the care of Mauricio Pochettino.

Spurs have already lost Paulinho, Toby Alderweireld and Victor Wanyama since the summer and will now turn to Alli, who has played at right-back for the club before.

Alli has received some great endorsement from some top players already, such as Luis Suarez and Cristiano Ronaldo, although he admits he's yet to meet the man who helped him become the world's most expensive teenager.

He told FourFourTwo.com: "When I go to the World Cup, it'll be nice to say I was on that team, because for me it's not something I've been part of but everyone at the team that I've been on the pitch with, whether they're strikers or centre-backs, is a great lad and a good mate and someone I look up to.

An open letter from the American Indian Movement, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the Earth Liberation Front, and Indigenous Environmental Network urges President Obama "to honor the Sacred Waters Treaty" with the first-of-its-kind water conservation plan he promised during the Native American Heritage Month event on March 18.

In the spirit of the first U.S. president to be both a Christian and a Native American, President Obama should "acknowledge that the first treaty of the U.S. was made for the purpose of protecting water."

The letter by the above four groups asks Obama to direct the Bureau of Reclamation, "to restore the Sacred Waters" and "to implement a sustainable and balanced conservation plan for the Great Lakes."

In his remarks on the March 18 event, President Obama said that "for my entire life, and for my entire first term in this office, I have dedicated myself to working in partnership with Native Americans and to restoring respect for their communities.

"And I did that in part because I care about the natural world and recognize that the next generation needs to know that we can do better together. This I take very personally. We will continue to build on the progress that I've made over the last six years and we are just beginning the work that lies ahead of us," he said.

Obama was referring to his Native American Heritage Month message of April 7, 2009, which included a joint statement with then-Indian Education Secretary Arne Duncan of a new program that aims to "connect young Native American youth with Native American institutions and provide education that is relevant and effective to address Native American aspirations in the 21st century; to establish the Native American Heritage Preservation Program, a strategic interagency initiative, which works to preserve important artifacts from the Native American communities in which they live; to advance the preservation of cultural resources, such as traditional art and folklore, through an Interagency Tribal Relations Council; to develop a research fund to provide more information on the Native American heritage and culture.

The letter from the aforementioned groups notes that a number of the areas where President Obama intends to expand his environmental protections include the Great Lakes watershed, including the proposed expansion of the Clean Water Rule and the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline ("DAPL").

One of the primary goals of the Sacred Waters Plan, wrote the signatories, "is to protect water resources within the Greater St. Lawrence River Basin. We call on the Bureau of Reclamation and the Federal Government to follow this precedent and protect a major source of clean drinking water, the water of the St. Lawrence River, the primary drinking water of 11 million people."

"We urge you to honor the Sacred Waters treaty with the first-of-its-kind water conservation plan that the United States government has yet to implement" the signatories said.

"Respect for this critical water resource will provide a path to a peaceful way forward for the Dakota Access Pipeline and all future energy projects," they continued. "This can and must include the development of a more sustainable economy that will move us away from a dependence on fossil fuels."

The results are reported in the Oct. 8 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The researchers, including Stanford postdoctoral researcher Christopher F. Henshilwood, were puzzled by unusual, ancient plankton that seemed to be drifting in the North Atlantic Ocean for almost 6 billion years.

The plankton are called "lobopods" and their diversity was previously recorded as the highest anywhere on Earth. The only other record of "floating" plankton in the ocean was in Antarctic waters, but these plankton are very rare, making their distribution difficult to study in detail.

Sterling Baynham, 30, of Santa Fe, was arrested at a business on Friday night on an assault charge after she was found locked in a locked vehicle outside a restaurant in Alamogordo, according to police.

Baynham reported that she had been drinking on Friday, and a fight broke out at a table in front of her vehicle, Santa Fe police Officer Ryan Frasier said. Baynham then got into the vehicle and drove away, he said.

In addition to hitting the door lock, Baynham also hit another vehicle and "was causing some type of damage to the vehicle," Frasier said.

The vehicle was parked outside the Sun Naturals restaurant, located at 3501 N. Alamogordo Blvd., at about 9 p.m. Friday when an employee reported that the car was still there. A resident opened the door to get the car keys.

As officers arrived, Baynham emerged from inside the locked vehicle and ran from the scene.

Police said that Baynham was found covered in blood at the Sun Naturals, where she admitted to having had several drinks during the night and having been drinking heavily, Frasier said. They learned that Baynham had been inside the car for an extended period of time, leaving the keys to the vehicle in the vehicle and not returning to get the keys to it, he said.

Officers arrived and arrested her in the parking lot, and she was taken to a local hospital for treatment, the officer said. When he tried to locate her, Baynham refused to comply with police calls to come out of the vehicle.

As a precaution, officers went to the Sun Naturals, where Baynham was found in her car, the officer said. The door was locked, and officers were unable to reach her with a key. The car was parked on the street and officers were still unable to locate her.

A local police K-9 was used to attempt to locate her, but Baynham refused to come out to follow him, Frasier said. At some point, another driver called 911 to report that she had hit the car in her attempt to leave the parking lot.<|endoftext|>The new season has begun, with new clubs coming online and their first match being played.

Israel has apologised during a UN Security Council meeting over reports it was investigating cases of Palestinians committing sexual assault and human trafficking.

"The government apologises to the president of the United States," said a statement from the Israeli foreign ministry.

The report was "clearly wrong", it said.

The White House warned the reports could "create greater tensions" in the region and "create the impression that Israel is not taking these allegations seriously".

It was reported on Tuesday that Israel and the US are investigating at least four possible cases of trafficking involving Israeli and Palestinian women.

Palestinian officials have accused Israel of seeking to "discredit" reports of sexual violence within their own society.

Pamela K. Taylor wrote a long post for TAI last week exploring what LeBron James is doing in the 2017 NBA season. In some ways, it was a bit of an understatement.

James has been so good that he's not merely a "player in disguise" anymore. By any measure, he's the best player in basketball, easily besting his previous career-bests. He's been the MVP of the All-Star Game, the most valuable player of the annual game (at 25.8 ppg) and a leading candidate for the league MVP, all in less than a half season.

"I think the only question left is: is LeBron the best player in the world?" writes Taylor. "I think he may well have passed Andre Roberson as the best player in the world."

As for the MVP of the Western Conference, I wrote about it three times before this season: I'm picking Paul George. The Pacers have been a league top-five team for five months and they've got to be considered the favorites to win their first playoff series since their 2008 title.

I thought George deserved to be named that MVP. He's played every minute of every game while having a monster season, ranking sixth in the NBA in scoring. The only players averaging more points per game this season are the Rockets' James Harden, the Warriors' Curry and the Trail Blazers' Damian Lillard. When we talk about the MVP of the West, this is the guy to look for. The Pacers beat the Warriors on Thursday and have a good chance Wednesday to beat the Warriors at home in Game 3.

The last time the Pacers finished the season with a better record than Golden State, in 2014-15, George scored 50 points and hit four threes in the series. In this series, the difference is just two games, with the Pacers playing the Cavaliers just twice. They're a better team than they were this time last year. They're certainly better than the Warriors who had to rebuild from a top-five playoff seed to make it out of the Western Conference playoffs. I think George holds the edge on a technicality: it has to be Curry, with James as a distant second.

On the other hand, I can't leave it at George because of the way he has played this season. The Pacers are an unstoppable force that can run on a team (even one lacking talent). That's the one big advantage on the Warriors that is hard for them to overcome: their offense struggles against the Pacers.

The Pacers have held teams to 87 points per game in this year's series, the fourth lowest in the NBA. They've scored 100 points three times, twice in games in which they were dominant and once in a game for which the Warriors were outscoring them by 26 points in the second half.

That's pretty incredible, but it's not the only thing that the Pacers do well in this series.

Pacers center Al Jefferson is a monster defensively, averaging 14.5 points and a block. He's averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds and 2.5 steals. He's also the only player averaging more than three assists on the Pacers. Those are big components of their defensive game that are missing from last year's team.

Last year, the Pacers had the best defense in the NBA, according to ESPN's Real Plus/Minus, with the third best mark on the road. This year, the Pacers have the worst mark in the NBA, a net rating of 24.6.

In terms of rebounding average, the Pacers are a solid team this season but the Warriors are the first team to hold them to two low double-doubles this season. On offense, the Pacers have found success in forcing the issue on the fast break, hitting a new low mark on the stat sheet with a net rating of -36, with two teams doing that to the Pacers this year. The Warriors are a pretty efficient offense, hitting a high percentage of three-pointers and converting at a high percentage of their free throws this season.

The key for the Pacers will be how they defend. The Pacers were solid on defense a season ago, allowing 95.9 points per 100 possessions while ranking fifth overall in points allowed per 100 possessions. They ranked third in points allowed per 100 possessions, but allowed 108.2 overall and 10th in three-point percentage allowed, so they did a terrific job at limiting their own scoring chances, which were a strength of their game last season.

This year, the Pacers are allowing 98.6 points per 100 possessions, fourth worst in the NBA. By any measure, that's a terrible defensive rating, but it's not quite as bad as the offensive line of the Warriors, who average 103 points per 100 possessions.

Last season, the Pacers were a better defense than you think, at least relative to just their opponents. They allowed 100 more points than predicted, but also more than the Warriors

As usual, I'm open to the community feedback so feel free to leave any comments below. Let me know what you think. If you have any kind of feature ideas I would really appreciate that as I love adding more to it.

The UI was a bit more complex than last year. For those who don't know what happened I've decided to introduce the UI for both a larger community and to create a more focused UI for new player content. The UI has two modes, one for the player (who has never played the game) and one for the developer. I think it helps clarify what needs to be done in game and which areas are more important. I've had players asking me about different elements and I hope it gives us a better idea of what are the things most important for a specific player. You'll have to play around to find the right one for you.

The Developer UI is completely open for any user to submit any kind of idea that is more about the game and less about the design. I hope people will be able to contribute to it and take things to the next level in the game.<|endoftext|>An international team of researchers (Lei et al., 2015 & 2016) has used a combination of molecular, genomics and biological approaches to identify a new human protein that may be important for muscle regeneration. The researchers, led by Dr. David Liu from the Stanford University School of Medicine and Center for Gene Therapy at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, found that the protein, MYOG, that is expressed during the healing process controls the proliferation of muscle stem cells in the body and may prevent overgrowth of other cells.

"Our work suggests that muscle regeneration can be controlled by specific signaling molecules, including MYOG, and that a therapy may be possible using an experimental drug to block MYOG as a means of avoiding muscle loss by controlling the inflammatory reaction after injury." explained Dr. Liu who also is affiliated in the Stanford Department of Medicine and Center for Gene Therapy

"Although the mechanism remains unclear, the use of an experimental therapy, such as anti-MYOG antibodies, may provide new treatment options to treat conditions where muscle cells are overgrown," says Dr. Liu. "The aim is to gain insight into the basic mechanisms behind recovery."

The researchers, led by Dr. Liu, studied tissue samples collected from injured muscle in the mice. They treated the samples with anti-MYOG antibodies and found an increased growth of satellite cells (smaller specialized cells) in the muscles of the animals. These satellite cells appear to help regenerate and help restore tissue health as damaged muscles recover.

"We've already shown that satellite cells are capable of generating satellite cell precursors, which is an important step for muscle regeneration," says Dr. Liu. "However, we are excited the fact that the treatment of our muscle tissues with anti-MYOG antibodies appears to allow for more efficient muscle regeneration."

"The use of specific immune system targeting agents to slow muscle regeneration and improve tissue function is a promising direction to focus on, since we want to develop drugs that can be targeted to restore a tissue's original functionality, and thereby prevent or diminish the loss of muscle tissue," he adds.

To achieve their goals, the authors of the paper are using a new approach to analyze and understand satellite cell activity. Specifically, they used a combination of immunohistochemical analysis and molecular and genetic approaches to identify the exact molecules and cellular targets responsible for the ability of satellite cells to differentiate into muscle precursor cells.

Previous studies, led by Dr. Liu in China had looked at MYOG in specific patients to identify a molecular receptor in a receptor called TGF-beta/myostatin that is activated by the hormone MYOG. However, Dr. Liu's group wanted to know if this was the only pathway for MYOG and whether other mechanisms were also involved in muscle stem cell regeneration. Their laboratory study suggests it may be. Dr. Liu's laboratory recently identified additional receptors that are activated by MYOG that are not shown to be activated by TGF-beta/myostatin.

"By examining gene expression patterns in tissues collected from mice treated with anti-MYOG antibodies and muscles obtained from injured muscles, we found that satellite cell proliferation and differentiation were not inhibited by this experimental therapy," said Dr. Liu. "These were the first results in humans supporting our experimental therapy strategy,

The agency says a decision on whether to proceed with the plan will be made in the coming months, after Congress considers a House spending bill that includes the Postal Service plan and one by the Trump administration to increase the Postal Service's funding by $5.5 billion.

The agency will ask Congress in June for authorization to do the plan and send its plans for the cuts for congressional sign off, said spokesman Sam Schumach.

"The Postal Service is currently in discussion with House and Senate appropriators and continues to assess all possible options in the context of this legislation," Schumach said.

Schumach said that the Postal Service received a commitment from the Postal Regulatory Commission in March to submit its postal plan by the end of the spring.

The Postal Service had previously reported having plans in the works for a restructuring proposal that would scale back some operations. The Postal Service and other postal agencies have been under pressure to reduce their finances as a growing number of mail carriers retire early, and the Postal Service faces future obligations to fund health care costs for some employees.

The agency recently hired a consultant to evaluate its financial position, and this month began collecting data and analyzing data on its financial performance to begin to determine its ability to stay financially sound. The Postal Service also plans to use information to create a comprehensive plan for future restructuring.

The proposed cuts to the Postal Service could come as soon as next month if a bill that includes the USPS plan becomes law, according to congressional aides.

A House appropriations bill includes $15 billion in funding for the Postal Service, and would add the postal proposal for a reduction to the agency's budget. One GOP aide said there's an indication that the bill could come up for a vote in early June.

Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate have said they oppose the postal plan and that Congress can find another solution for the agency through legislation.

If the proposal goes forward, it could cause problems in fiscal 2018, as part of the Postal Service's budget, the legislation contains spending cuts to the agency that would offset what the restructuring might cost.

The House bill, sponsored by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., would change how the Postal Service does business by reducing costs and encouraging more in-house service.

The post office would need to find savings up to $5.8 billion over a decade, if it's approved in its current form. That's a substantial amount of money for a nonprofit agency that is funded through regular tax on people and sales.

Schumach declined to share the postal agency's annual budget, but said it's been increasing as the economy continues to grow, a trend that the department has seen as well over the last couple of decades. The agency has an annual budget of more than $75 billion to spend.<|endoftext|>The United States Department of Commerce is investigating allegations made by the Chinese government that US chip giant Intel has been interfering with the semiconductor industry.


Government officials told Chinese media that Intel has been working on "exploiting the technology of other companies and manipulating the market", a local newspaper reported on Tuesday, adding that Intel is accused of "systemic unfair practices and price manipulations".


A complaint was received in January, an unnamed government official told Shanghai Daily newspaper.


Intel, however, denied that any of its employees were "targeted" or "attacked".


"Intel does not share allegations about alleged improper business practices involving our business with any potential competitors, such as China," an Intel spokeswoman said.


"Intel does not conduct itself unfairly, on one side or the other, because of its customers' needs or its manufacturing processes."

The number one question in this election is what would you do about North Korea? (For me it's the Trump problem). If we can't even find a willing candidate to do anything about North Korea, we should be very worried. After the last election, I started to wonder: does the U.S. even have the will to change Kim Jong Un from an irrational power base to a rational power base? When Kim has to deal with a leader whose own country is threatening to nuke him, does the Kim have the tools required to handle this situation in a rational way?

As I listened to last night's Republican debate, I thought about this question: how does a crazy guy like Kim Jong Un keep his country together?

I came to the conclusion that Kim Jong Un has two types of troops. He has regular soldiers, and he has elite forces. The elite troops are the ones who pull off big nuclear war-games. In recent years, North Korea has carried out nuclear war-games on an unprecedented scale. The North's first "nuclear war-game" in 2009 came in response to U.S. naval exercises off south Korea. In the current war-game, North Korean nuclear missiles have a range of between 1,500 miles and 3,000 miles, and could reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.

So, the elite troops must have more than a military training program. After all, it seems only natural that the elite soldiers have to be smarter, more resourceful, and more resourceful enough to handle nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un would never have let his people die of starvation if they weren't better trained, more resourceful, and more resourceful than the rest of the country. I think this is the secret of North Korea's success: the elite members, who are most likely to survive the famine, are the ones who are the most willing to use nuclear weapons. They must be good at making decisions and executing plans.

When Kim was young, he was a young, stupid, and greedy boy. He was afraid of doing anything wrong — which meant he couldn't be very good at anything or very smart, both of which are essential for success in life.

But after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, and the success of the famine, Kim Jong-un rewrote his education from childhood up. He focused his energies not on surviving in a survivalist scenario, or even on getting a good job as is the norm in North Korea, but on improving his own image in the eyes of the outside world. He wanted to be popular in America because that is where the rich Americans go, to be popular in Asia because that is where the rich Asians go, and to keep his country running smoothly because he was confident that there would be another chance to run it later in life.

If you can convince a dictator that "the people in power are running the country," he can change. North Korea does not really trust American military might. When there was an American war on their border, they did not attack. When the U.S. sent in nuclear weapons in 1999, they did not attack. So North Korea is not an easy country to change. I think this is why North Korea's elite troops always seem to come out on top.

But even if Kim Jong Un could somehow persuade his people that they had to obey him, I wouldn't be too worried. Kim Jong-un must be pretty good at running his country. If he were bad at it, the rest of his country wouldn't have had to suffer so much. You could imagine a scenario where the elite troops could be convinced to make their move. They wouldn't do so blindly, of course. They would need some intelligence that it might be a bad move.

The elite troops would need some intelligence that it might be a bad move.

Kim might also be scared that his elite troops might be executed. He would prefer them to be killed over captured. That might be his choice, but this is not a good way to handle a leader. It's a terrible way to handle a country. If Kim wants to see his elite troops executed he's not going to just ignore that possibility. If he does have a choice between executing the elite troops and making his country great again, he wants to see his elite troops executed. Even if he is completely wrong about this, he wants this to happen.

Now I'm thinking about what we should do if Kim decides to execute them. How do we make peace? Should we give up on North Korea? Can an idealist imagine that Kim Jong-un has a new approach? He probably doesn't. Maybe peace with North Korea is going to be a little difficult, but as long as Kim Jong-un is irrational and irrational people will die. I am not quite sure what my answer is about how to get rid of this threat, but I do have a guess. The solution to North Korea's

Cops investigating the incident have yet to tell the Beddoes, pictured, what prompted them to put their son (pictured) into a washing machine in the family's rural home on December 8

It happened around 8pm on December 8 when officers went to the house in the small community of Stannock after Jamie and Julie Beddoe allegedly told them an 'unexpected party' was taking place.

Police entered the main bedroom and found the boy with his head in an upstairs closet and a blood stained towel on the countertop.

His body was later put in a plastic bin bag and removed from the property. A day after he was taken by police.

No further information about the incident has been released and no official cause of death has been released.

Officers are keeping their investigation on hold until at least January as they wait for blood tests to be done.

A spokesman for Alberta health said a post-mortem would be carried out in the near future.

Police have not released the name or age of the boy.

As a young journalist living in Delhi, the story of Kavita Krishnan has always come as a real eye-opener and a shock to the system.

In her early youth, Kavita was a very popular figure in Delhi's media circles. She was at the heart of the influential, well-connected, high-caste media and her influence is still felt today.

Her sudden and dramatic move from the city to the UK in 1983-84 where she set up an independent media house in Brighton, where her son worked, brought to an end her illustrious career and was followed by a series of other career interruptions that put an end to her life before she could complete the unfinished legacy she had in the UK.

This interview has been conducted, edited and translated by Dr Arup Chawla, formerly a journalist in Delhi, who has followed her career for years. The views expressed are solely those of the author.

Who is Kavita Krishnan?

She didn't really exist. She was just a name, and she was someone you passed on information to… she was more of a myth in the form of a character. But there is this story, about how she was born as a girl, who was married once, had a child and was sent back to the village in Bihar. Her first husband left her and she became a stay-at-home-mum and stayed close to home. Her second husband died and she went on to have three more children with the same man. But this is the kind of tale that comes as a shock to people – that they get married once and they get divorced, that they have three children and they divorce. And she had all these relationships, all these people all over the world, every time she moved.

Why did she leave India?

The first relationship Kavita had with a foreign journalist was with Mr Thomas Bearden in New York. He didn't go as far as proposing marriage, but I find that intriguing. He sent her a letter, which she had to read after being married and she said: "Oh Thomas, this is very exciting." She got married to an Indian journalist. She had a relationship with an Italian journalist. She had a relationship with an Australian journalist. She had a relationship with an Australian diplomat. So when this letter of Mr Bearden arrived after she married, it is very difficult to know how she decided to go back to India to live with her parents.

I think she realised that there was something wrong with what she was doing. So why is the first story about her marriage so far flung in New York, and why was another story about her relationship with an Australian journalist thrown out of the country? And why do you find the relationship with the European journalist to be so problematic?

Why did she leave her parents' house and go back to the village, only to have her parents send her back again? I think she realized that there was something wrong with what she was doing. So why is the first story about her marriage so far flung in New York, and why was another story about her relationship with an Australian journalist thrown out of the country?

How did you go about researching this book to get so many details right, and how did you write it?

When I was working as a journalist in Delhi, I used to follow some of the other journalists and how they were working and how their careers developed. There was another journalist who I used to follow – he didn't seem to have a particular style. As I got to know him, I thought that he was very interesting, I got hold of his story a couple of years later from a British newspaper. He was then working in Australia as a journalist, and he was writing stories for other newspapers. And I got hold of his notes and I went back to see what he had been talking about in a series of notebooks. I started reading his notes and it was the very interesting thing, he wrote notes in Bengali and English and Hindi – it was one of the first times that I had had any linguistic input into these notes. I asked him how he'd travelled across two continents. I started to understand what his journey was like. And it was an amazing story. He had travelled to India just in the last 12 months from the time he left India in 1983, just under one year. He was working on stories for the newspapers in India at the time. His father – he also wrote stories for newspapers in India around the same time, but he did not go as far for the newspapers.

After I worked as a journalist and after the notes came with the story of his travels across two continents, I began to gather material, I had access to all kinds of material, and I began to gather everything that the other journalists had written about him and where he was working.

Then, after having the first draft of the book a few months ago, I went back onto it because the story

You know: That time that the New York Times posted its front page banner for the night of April 4 while Republicans in Congress were trying to pass the sequester?

But it's not just the front page banner.

Today, the Times' front page has a story that looks like this:

What does this tell you about the Times?

First, that the Times thinks the sequester has some bad consequences; even though it doesn't call it that.

Second, that the Times expects anyone to believe that the sequester is a mistake (even though it isn't).

That's one thing the Times didn't seem to be able to hide: Republicans' intent to slash defense (and thus, domestic) spending at all costs.

But now, it's telling readers that the sequester is a good idea.

I mean, the headline says, "Budget battle looms over $1.2 trillion spending cut." And the rest of the story seems to believe it...

That's really not a good message for those of us in the military and non-military industries. I don't know anyone who is a fan of sequestration that likes to read about it. We have to tell the public that the only good reason for a sequester is in order to do something really, really crazy: to take military spending and put it on par with domestic spending.<|endoftext|>You do not have javascript enabled.

They despised them. They hated that our leaders would compromise and sign things they didn't believe in. Our leaders—like most of the people I knew at all levels—had an obvious hatred of the government, and a sense of entitlement toward it. They viewed it as a way to get something out of us.

But even that was an overstatement. Most of our leaders didn't feel like our leaders. Their hatred for our leaders often came out of a love for ourselves—or at least their perception of love for themselves.

I was born in 1944, in the shadow of World War II, the year the Korean War started. The war had ended in 1953—but after Korea the Americans became increasingly aggressive toward China. I heard the constant warnings on Radio to always be ready and have guns. It was like living in a time bomb, bombarded in ways that had nothing to do with the war. I always thought that if I got shot at, I would probably die.

So I didn't think any less of the leaders. They got it. In fact, it was their war. It was hard for people who understood war to understand that we were fighting against our own government. We all thought they were fighting against Communists.

But in fact, the Chinese government was fighting against us. And the Vietnamese government was fighting against the Communists. In fact, we were fighting the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army. But they weren't fighting anyone we knew. They were fighting us.

After we lost the war, Americans went to war for a new kind of war. They were fighting the Cold War. The Cold War was between two ideologies: communism versus capitalism. It was between different versions of nationalism—between the Soviets and the United States. It became a conflict all Americans wanted. It began on the Korean peninsula in 1950 and escalated as it went on. In fact, the Cold War, including the Korean war, is what gave the US its military power, and the most intense nuclear competition. It was the worst of all possible worlds, in which you always had an enemy.

The idea that American and Soviet nuclear weapons could destroy the world was always shocking to people back home. After Korea, many people in this country still didn't believe it, even after the Russians tested nuclear weapons. We got it.

As for the Vietnamese, they were never really fighting the Communists. They were fighting to keep their country from collapsing. What would have happened if it failed? The same thing that happened after Pearl Harbor in 1941. America declared war on Germany and Japan.

If the Americans came in with a real war effort, they would have won. But they didn't, which is part of why they were so reluctant about fighting the Communist countries in Vietnam and elsewhere.

That wasn't a very popular policy with Americans at the end of World War II. No one

BEST SEXIEST BODY SHOP EVER!

Hello, everyone! Welcome to my personal website and I am so excited to share this with you! So for this post I thought I would share what I think are the five best sexiest bikini bodies around, in no particular order. Of course, this is just my opinion and is not scientific. For all you science nerds out there, you will have to wait a little more because I am going to get right down to it.

Before I start I just want to say that I have only included girls who have at least one or two photos that I feel look absolutely amazing. This list will be updated as I get more pictures. Also, all you ladies out there, I don't look down upon you or anything. I'm simply showing you what I believe are the sexiest bikini bodies around, and if you agree, keep on checking in because I will keep growing this list.

If you have your own list, please share with us!

5. Adriana Lima


I really only included Adriana Lima because I feel like she is totally flawless, but for the sake of this list I wanted to include the other Brazilian bombshells that have a more athletic look. I don't know if they are the same girls, but look at how similar they are! I mean, there are just two big differences: Adriana was filmed a year ago and the girls don't have the same facial expressions that Lima has. If you have some Adriana pictures to give us a second opinion, that would be great!

4. Jennifer Lawrence


Look at this body. Look at what Jennifer Lawrence has achieved in the last two years to just look like she did in her 20s. Look at her thighs. Look at her face. This girl has so many muscles. This woman has gained just about 200 pounds in a relatively short period of time, but not only that, but she is a super model. I love her body, I love her figure, I love her face. I will give you a warning next time though. You will be so busy looking at Jennifer Lawrence's body that you might forget you're looking at a very pretty girl.

3. Mila Kunis


I will be honest, I knew I was never going to include Mila Kunis's body if it wasn't this sexy. I'm not saying that I think Mila Kunis is a bad looking girl, but I feel like she could be more attractive for me to take this picture. I know she is super cute, but I think if I were to stand behind her, I might just look like an idiot. Plus, as I've mentioned a million times before, if I had to choose between Mila Kunis and someone else, it would probably be this beauty.

2. Gisele Bundchen


Gisele is one of those girls that you just know is hot, and she has achieved something that very few people can say they have accomplished at any point in time. She has the body of a model, but the body of a super model. There are very few people that have both the body and the style of a super model, but in Gisele's case, she is both. With her perfect figure, long legs and amazing figure, I would really love to have a chance to take this picture with her.

1. Sofia Vergara


Here is a beautiful picture of Sofia Vergara. You might be saying, why are you looking at her? What is wrong with you? Well, look at those tits! They are massive, big firm, and if you can see them well enough in this picture I feel like just maybe she would be in a couple of the top ten bikini body lists right now.

The best bikini bodies are not built from the inside out, but from the outside in. You just need the right clothes and the right personality to complete you. You also need to have fun and be yourself. And these bikini bodies just add to that! The girls of Gossip Girl certainly embody this perfectly. I'm not saying I love every single one of them, but there is nothing that can go wrong with them so they all deserve a spot on this list as does Jennifer Lawrence. I think she is the sexiest model that is walking the planet, but I think Adriana Lima just edges out her in a lot of ways. Who would win in a face-to-face contest? And that is actually the question I ask myself, every day. All you guys out there, what is your opinion on the five bikini bodies? Which ones are your favorites? And where exactly should we go to find some of these girls? You guys rock.

What body do you think is sexy? If you know what I'm talking about, leave the rest in the comment section below.

======================================== SAMPLE 483 ========================================
By John Geddes

The U.S. Treasury Department has published its annual list of "national security priority actions" to cut terrorism financing, a list that, unsurprisingly, continues to be filled with corporate money managers who play fast and loose with the United States' "national-security" framework while profiting handsomely from those very funds.

The 2014 list, which has already been in existence for several years in various forms but published for 2014, consists of more than half a dozen countries targeted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and includes several big players in the energy and financial sectors.


Targets include the leaders in Iran, China, Sudan, Burma, Libya, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and China's Xinjiang Province. In 2014 the Treasury added "China's Silk Road Fund, which is an endowment of the Central Government of the People's Republic of China; China's Xinjiang Human Rights Protection Unit, an entity established to enforce human rights; and the Ministry of Public Security, the National People's Congress, and other agencies."

In total, there are a total of 22 countries included on the list – with the State Department acknowledging that all countries that are "state sponsors of terrorism" are likely to be on the list.

Here are some of the countries who managed to make this year's list:

Iran

While the U.S. government has been targeting Iran's financial system and banking system, this year's "National Security Priority" is focused on the country's "financial and commercial sectors." A list of entities which are in the "financial and commercial sectors" includes: Bank Mellat, Bank Mitint, Bank Saderat, Bank Rahimat, KKG Bank, Tanchang Bank, Bicom, National Iran Gas Company, Pouvad-e-Rouhani Bank, Bank Sepah and Sader Oil Company. The Treasury Department lists Iran's Central Bank as one of the most important "target" in its country, as is Banco Delta Asia (BDA), Iran's main foreign exchange dealer.

"While the government of Iran may be considered to be a 'threat/target' listed in the Treasury designation," the Treasury notes, "the designation does not affect the banking sector in Iran. The central bank… is allowed to engage in the use of foreign exchange through Iranian banks."

This does not mean the Central Bank is not being sanctioned:

Iran's Central Bank maintains access to U.S. dollar funding through the use of a network of commercial banks in various countries. For example, BDA is in the process of closing an account, which could affect its ability to transact financial transactions in U.S. dollars. Moreover, Iran's central bank has taken measures to restrict Iranian nationals from taking out money transfers in foreign currencies, which could affect trade and investment. U.S. sanctions also include measures that prevent U.S. citizens and non-Americans in Iran from opening or maintaining a bank account.

China

The country is again on the U.S. Treasury's list for being a country "that supports or protects" terrorism or those who facilitate that activity. China's financial and financial-related sectors come top of the list:

China's government-owned and state-controlled financial institutions, which are closely related to the political and economic institutions of the government; and state-owned and state-controlled financial institutions, which act as an agent of any political or national security-related government institution, including international organizations or organizations of third parties.

"State-owned and state-controlled financial institutions may do business with U.S. companies and banks. This may involve engaging in financial transactions such as loans, investments, insurance, or debt-financing."

"The Chinese commercial sector's reliance on the sale and purchase of foreign exchange is a major source of funding for terrorism," notes the 2015 US Treasury Department "Terrorism Financing" report. China has a huge appetite for foreign currency – as much as $1.5 trillion a year – and has continued to buy up U.S. Treasury debt at an unsustainable pace in the last several years.

China's central bank, in collaboration with its foreign exchange commercial banks, was recently caught on camera bribing a U.S. official in hopes of securing a better price on US Treasury debt via a $500 million payment. China's purchase of $2.5 trillion in U.S. Treasury debt, meanwhile, dwarfs that of all other countries combined.

"Given China's financial dominance over the next 10 to 20 years, this move is not surprising," notes the Washington Post, adding that the Obama administration has "notched some notable successes" over the last five years in trying to curb China's growing economic influence, "with a more concerted approach to combat financial crimes in the name of fighting terrorism."

LONDON (Reuters) - British police have spoken to the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as part of their investigation into claims of Russian meddling in the presidential election, a spokeswoman said on Friday.

The spokeswoman for Britain's Metropolitan Police, Barbara Wilkinson, said "detectives from the National Crime Agency have been investigating the matter and we continue to support their work".

She was asked about comments by Trump in an interview with Reuters that Britain's recent decision to quit the European Union was a factor in his thinking.

"I was here when the news came out. I think that (Brexit) had a lot to do with it. I think it had to do with the fact that the people that ran the country outside of the United States obviously didn't have a good experience with the people and how they ran the country."

Asked by Reuters whether Trump had been quizzed over the issue, Wilkinson said there had been a meeting between "officials" from "the FBI and the foreign office and the president elect's legal team" but said there were no details.<|endoftext|>Drew Carey

Birthday: Apr 2, 1960

Birthplace: Philadelphia

A native of Philadelphia -- and former resident of Phoenix, which is the hometown of his brother, John -- Drew Carey was raised in a strict Jewish home. Although he was in most ways a typical Jewish kid, he was also fascinated by the secular world of celebrities. From an early age, Carey wanted to be an actor. From age 10 to 16, he took acting classes, and worked at theater and voice performances, where he met friends, eventually establishing his own acting company, DreamWorks Interactive. In 1999, Carey received a special grant from the Israeli government, and in 2000, started DreamWorks Interactive, a global company he co-founded with Jeffrey Katzenberg, another Jewish American.


Carey went on to win a record-breaking 17 Emmys for his work on Broadway as P.S. Eliot, and then won the prestigious George Foster Peabody Award. He married fellow American actress Linda E., in 1996. They divorced in 2001. He recently had a run-in with NBC, whose executives were annoyed by his insistence on his views about the need for Israel to be self sufficient. Carey is survived by his two sons, J.J. and Christopher, and his parents, John and Linda. His first marriage, to American actress Linda E. (née Kohn), also ended in divorce, but Carey and Eunice Kohn remained close friends. He is survived by his first wife and three other children.


Survivors include his children.


Drew Carey's last film role was in the film "Hair," which was released in July of 2007. He is survived by his sons, Matthew Carey, Matthew Carey, Christopher Carey, and J.J. Carey.

A "staggering" 90.5 percent of all prisoners in France have access to a reading material for their religious convictions. With a mere 15.5 percent of the population opting for an alternative to prison, the French are the world's most religious nation, according to recent statistics.

The World Values Survey, conducted by the London-based Centre for Social Cohesion (CSU-IFOP), ranked the United Kingdom No. 1, with 90.8 percent of British residents reporting that religion is important in their lives. France, with just 14.4 percent of the population, ranked behind Switzerland (90.9 percent), Finland (90.1 percent) and Austria (90 percent). The remaining 3 percent did not provide details.

France's Prison Service has been under the microscope after the Paris attacks of November 2015 left 130 people dead and 1,500 injured. Authorities found the attackers' apartment in an area that was "infiltrated," "seized" from a church and a community center known for its "radicalization of young people" and that was home to Muslims.

The survey showed that the two gunmen, who were killed as they tried to shoot at police when they opened fire at the Bataclan theater, had links to Salafists, a movement that was "undermined" in the 1970s by French state-sponsored schools of Islamic studies.

The "Salafists have been discredited" with a new generation of French men "lonely" for an identity, said CSU-IFOP director Gilles Ranchet. "The question is, what do they propose, do they have a solution or are they an alternative," he added. A "lack of political will," the lack of "civic courage," the desire for "clarity" and "decision" by lawmakers were among other factors cited.

Some 60 per cent of women expressed their approval of "being an Islamic wife" and 43 percent agreed that a wife "must submit to her husband."

Sixty five percent believe that "the public cannot allow a society where a woman has a different life than her husband," according to the CSU-IFOP. Fifty seven percent believe that women are more "indirectly responsible" for men's violence and 45 percent believe women are responsible for men's violence against them.

While 67.2 percent of citizens approved of a law banning the hijab in public schools, 60.9 percent supported keeping face veils in the workplace except for health and security, a clear sign that France does not want to ban veils in general but "only those worn by Muslim women in the workplace," Ranchet said.

The study also showed that 67.9 percent of women believe that a woman is "responsible for men's behavior," compared to 51.9 percent of men. Two thirds of women and men, respectively, called for equal responsibility for all roles in French society.

The survey of 10,000 people aged 15 to 85 by the CSU-IFOP is a "unique" study and is conducted annually "in Europe, North America and South Africa," according to the center.<|endoftext|>The following article contains spoilers for The Dark Knight Rises, but those of you who are already familiar with the movie are unlikely to read this.

There are two main types of people to whom The Dark Knight Rises opens: those people who are deeply worried about the future of the United States and those who are excited to jump straight in and start saving lives. The former seem more on the left-side of the political spectrum, the latter more on the right; both seem to believe the present state (or the near future state, when you really get down to it) is pretty grim, with few options left for the people who live in it to do anything about their lives. The question I have, then, is what it would have been like if the film had been directed by a different director (the same way, admittedly, that the film was directed by Christopher Nolan) and had had an entirely different ending that was more fitting to the film as a whole.

If I didn't know any better, one of my first thoughts would probably be that it would have been like the ending of Apocalypse Now: a final war scene. The American-led forces would slaughter all the Vietnamese and Viet Cong on every possible corner, and those survivors would either be left to die or be shipped off to a very brutal prison camp in North Africa. Or maybe the soldiers would get their revenge with a "hero's" death or just a bullet to the face. Or perhaps the filmmakers simply decided that that's enough. It's all entirely possible, of course, but the feeling that The Dark Knight Rises evoked when it came to the Vietnam-related plot points would have been a lot less grim and more hopeful.

A recent study has revealed that the prevalence of childhood obesity is soaring in Saudi Arabia.

According to a report released by the Health Development Foundation, nearly 5 percent of the Saudi Arabian children aged between birth and seven years old - or roughly 22.6 million children - were obese during 2013-2016, compared to just 3.4 percent in the same period five years ago.

This staggering leap mirrors the growing concern over the health risks of childhood obesity in the kingdom and has been met with calls for a drastic health overhaul.

According to a report released by the Health Development Foundation, nearly 5 percent of the Saudi Arabian children aged between birth and seven years old - or roughly 22.6 million children - were obese during 2013-2016

The alarming figure - which the UN's Development Programme (UNDP) has described as a 'global tragedy' - comes amid an unprecedented rise in obesity in the Kingdom.

The UNDP said it is no coincidence that the Saudi obesity epidemic has reached unprecedented levels in the last few years.

Since 2007, the health ministry has monitored obesity trends and commissioned a health study after the country's first obesity study.

'The obesity problem in Saudi Arabia has been rising steadily over the past few years, with the most recent report showing a staggering 32 per cent higher percentage of Saudis overweight or obese compared to 2013, and the third highest number in the world, behind Australia and the United States,' the UNDP said.

'The government and society must now focus on a holistic approach to address childhood obesity,' it added.

The first part can be found here.) For much of the 20th century, Americans viewed political activism as a male pastime, a hobby mostly reserved for men and used as a way to advance their way of life. In the 1960s, however, the feminist movement became a popular outlet for women, and a significant threat to male power. This "second wave" of feminism, marked by the rise of radical feminism and women seeking "self-determination" at the workplace and on the political scene, took form in part, we think, in reaction to the early American movement's emphasis on female "dominance" over male "subordination." Feminism was seen by many in the late 19th century as a threat to American patriarchal culture, and thus, by and large it was a male hobby (a few prominent feminists even called themselves "menlovers"). But the feminists also challenged the old feminist "female" idea that all women are, by nature, "submissive" to men. In the early years of the feminist movement, many male women, including writers, historians, and journalists, participated in its work, and a few prominent women also advocated for and advocated for women's equality. In addition, as feminism gained power, some male feminists criticized the movement for being too focused on "men's oppression." The feminist and women's movements, of course, were also the battleground for a civil rights movement that fought against discrimination against women. But the women's movement's most vocal supporters, both male and female, saw the feminist movement as a threat to the rights, roles, and privileges of white American women and men. There is not much doubt that there were, and still are, some feminists who hold these views. Nonetheless, the feminist movement, to date, has made many important and significant strides toward the equality of women. Today, more than ever before, American women are fighting for the equal opportunity to participate in society, to enjoy economic security, and to take part in political life. These successes have been achieved largely because of the women's rights movement. To understand this movement and their history, we need to get a better understanding of what feminism means at its core. How Feminism Started

The phrase "feminism" is sometimes used, erroneously, in the sense of the new-old and supposedly "radical" feminism first described in the 1920s by the feminist activist Mary Wollstonecraft. If you ask most readers this, they'll say something like "oh, the 1920s?" and tell you about the suffragettes, the Industrial Workers of the World, the National Organization for Women. But there's an assumption here that is far from clear. The term feminism came into common usage in the late 1850s, during the first wave of feminism. It was derived from the Greek prefix femine, meaning "female" or "woman," referring to the Latin female sex organ. Feminism emerged from the first wave of feminism in the mid 19th century, and it was an outgrowth of the earlier efforts to challenge misogyny, and the sexual discrimination of women. Some feminists even argued that the traditional view of "male" and "female" should be revised, in order

Chapter Text

The rain-caked, sunburned, snot-nosed boy shuddered as he slowly rose from his spot on the bed. He sat up, looking around the empty room. Where was his pillow? It was by the wall, and it was missing.

His first thought was probably a bad one. He'd slept in a room without a bed.

It was a good thing, as well, he decided. Even without a bed, he was too drowsy to go back to sleep. Even if he could get his pants back on, he'd have to have a shower first. When he'd first woken up all he saw was his parents standing over him, their eyes focused intently on the clock. His breath caught in his throat when they made out the time for himself.

His mom wasn't in the next room, and his dad hadn't come downstairs in time to make him breakfast, or at least none of his breakfast. The man was just staring blankly, eyes closed, as if the clock and the breakfast would solve everything if he just sat still for a moment. With that final thought, the boy sighed. He would wait in the hallway until his parents got back. He'd eat right before school. It'd be better than his usual morning snack.

But no, that was foolish. Because all he wanted to do was sleep.

He sat there for a minute, thinking. Was all that so bad? That his parents were making an effort to make him have breakfast? What did that even mean?

Oh, his life would be boring and predictable after that, he decided. Nothing would surprise him anymore. He didn't know why he was so excited when his parents made out the minute clock, but he was. He was so excited. His breath caught when he saw the clock again, but this time the face wasn't as blank. It had the same numbers written across it; it was 9:00 in the morning.

He stood slowly and went to look at it. He saw the number one. How could he have missed that?

He tried to take it in, but he wasn't sure how. It was dark outside, and there was a light coming from outside of his window. It cast a pale tint onto everything inside his tiny, tiny room, with the exception of his bedframe. It was a pale, pale yellow.

He couldn't help but stare at it when his attention wasn't occupied by the clock.

After a long moment in which the boy lost his breath and his eyes darted from one side of his room to another, he came to a realization. It was so important that he thought it over carefully. He could do nothing about it now. Not now, when his parents were busy with something important. It was probably a good thing they were busy, too; he needed food.

He stood up, moving to the dining room. As he made his way over to the table set up, he started to think back. Had his dad noticed the clock? Had he noticed his parents making out in the hallway as well? As he thought about it more, he couldn't help but wonder. What was important?

He wanted to say it out loud, then. "Daddy! Momma!" he shouted.

"Daddy?" his father asked in return. He was sitting with his back to the windows. In his other hand, he held a small, square snack box in which was one white-skinned lump of something.

"We gotta get food, or I'm gonna be late to school! I swear!"

"Sorry, son, but I don't have time now because I'm giving Mrs. Grisham a hand with this."

"I'm still not done with that one! I'm so excited! I can't wait!"

"Sorry, son. I don't know how long it will take for you to be ready to walk, but that's why you're in here." His father said with a frown.

"Why's momma working on Mrs. Grisham's hand? Can't I do it?"

"That's Mrs. Grisham's hand too, son."

"What do I have to do?" The boy asked confused. He didn't understand why his parents would have to work on each other's hands when their hands were the same color.

"I don't know." His father said sheepishly. "I didn't think you'd notice, but it's pretty common for kids to get so excited they can't sit still long enough for me to get their food." He shook his head. "Now, son, can you try and get your hands to calm?"

"I'm so excited! I'm on the brink of a genius idea!

The last few decades of science have made some striking developments about the human brain, but there is always something very special about the year 2000. That's because this was the year that I became a father. I was born on August 3, 1990, and I've been carrying this tiny baby inside my body ever since, but my first birthday celebration was one of the happiest days my family has ever had. Yes, that's right -- the first party of my life was held in my parents' house, with my husband and I as a happy (and exhausted) couple, and my little girl sitting in a swing in the yard. For us, that's a big deal. To my children, it's a miracle, because they'll never experience the same special kind of joy we did as a single mom, or two parents, or two single parents. At no point can anybody say how much we enjoyed it (and no one would make me feel too bad about having two kids), but we did. We made it all the way to our second birthday without saying a single word about our new additions. I think that's a little bit crazy. The only thing more impressive than having a beautiful little girl, however, is knowing that I made the decision not to even tell them when I found out about my second pregnancy -- or when it was possible that I was pregnant. I always considered myself quite private about my children, but I realized that that is a huge mistake. You have to make someone happy by being open and honest with them. I don't think it's very easy to love somebody if you don't let them know how much you love them, and that's definitely something that will keep me strong. I always tell my children (my oldest is almost 7) that "love is a gift" and that I will keep them safe and love them no matter what. It has proven to be true. I do not have some type of a hidden agenda in our lives. As a matter of fact, I think I'm a pretty honest person. I do not like lying when it has to do with a relationship. If there is something that could be construed as lying to my children, I know now that it would not be. On the plus side, being a person that is honest with me means that I let my kids know when I am happy -- and when I am sad, sad times will follow. When my daughter was born, it was a huge surprise to all my family, but when I found out the truth, I was absolutely devastated. I cried on my hands and knees. I couldn't even sit with her when she was born because I was so emotional. When I found out she was a girl, I still couldn't understand how my family couldn't have known about it, but at that moment I realized that they never even met a daughter. I was the first family member to find out the truth about my pregnancy, so I decided to tell my children the truth about my pregnancy -- even though I know it would have meant so much for them had they ever known. We still live close by with my mom and dad and she always gets angry at how hard it was for me to admit that I was pregnant. She says that my baby would have had a lot of trouble breathing in the first few months and would have had a difficult delivery. She would not have been able to care for her, and it would have been hard to handle and it would take a toll on her too. All of that is true. Now that I have two little ones to look after, she has no idea how I am doing. I think she feels the same way I do -- I don't think she understands why I did not tell them sooner or why I wasn't more open about the pregnancy. Nowadays, I don't feel the need to be honest with these wonderful children every day, because when they get older (and I hope I will one day be with them long enough for them to become grandparents), the whole conversation will just make too much sense to them. But I will always have a very special bond with them. I love my kids just as much as they love me. It is a very sad day for me when I see my children growing up, especially since most of them are now teenagers. I never thought I'd be feeling this way in any other regard, but I think I need my kids in all different situations. I do believe that we become what we fear, and as a kid who didn't always feel very loved, I know that to be true. Now that I have a little experience around my own kids, I know that they understand that love comes in all different shapes and sizes. The one thing that's true about our relationship is that it is equal, even though we are very different, and I think that's an amazing quality. As soon as a stranger says something negative to my children, their reaction just makes me so happy, and I feel so proud of them because that can only be due to me being a good mom

There are many reasons why a home buyer might choose to lease a home—whether it's because they want a home that is safer, more convenient, or just because it's cheaper—or whether they want a home they can own in a matter of years.

Either way, if you are making the choice to lease then you have to know how property tax works in Illinois. Landlords in Illinois can be required to pay property taxes on homes they lease. The amount depends on the contract. To make the math easier, we made a simple calculator that allows the calculation of tax payments.

How many years are the annual rentals allowed for?

Landlords can charge as few as one additional year. However, we do not recommend charging more than two additional years.

Is there any consideration for the length of the lease?

No. This is simply the length of the contract.

Is there any consideration when it comes to the amount of the tax payments?

Yes. The landlord and buyer must negotiate and agree on the amount to be paid as part of the lease agreement.

Is there any consideration for the length of the rental?

Yes, this also has to be worked out in the lease agreement. This is known as a "reasonable" lease term. The rental must be one to two years long. Anything longer than two years is considered "unsafe" by the state.

Should there be any consideration for time spent in the property or outside the property? Should the landlord be required to keep the property in good repair?

The answer to all of these questions will depend entirely on the size and location of the home. There are many factors to consider in choosing who owns a home and where it needs to be housed. This calculator will help you to calculate the amount you will be responsible for property tax.

When should I start paying the property tax?

A property that is the home of multiple people is responsible for paying all of the taxes in some way that helps the people it is sharing the home with.

For example, if the property was previously a hotel with many people staying at the property and the current tenants are moving out, then all tenants will pay property tax when they move out. But, if the property has five tenants, then each tenant would need to pay property tax before they moved. This can be a challenging situation to figure out the amount that each tenant should pay.

How do I calculate property tax liability for a home on which I will live?

Enter in the date you want to calculate the tax liability and then use the calculator to see what taxes you will likely owe.

How do I determine how much tax is due?

The tax rate is determined by the county. For property taxes in Cook County, the rate is 6.25%. In Kane County it's 7.25%. In DuPage County it's 8%. In Lake County it's 10%. The rate is based on the cost of living of the county.

How much more of a tax shock could a home buy in Chicago?

If you live in Chicago, it will be more stressful to own a house outside of Chicago than it will be to rent in Chicago. The amount of taxes depends on the county, local taxes on the rent, and what other government assistance you receive in addition to property taxes.

How much more could the property taxes be if my taxes are paid monthly instead of yearly?

If your taxes are paid weekly or monthly your monthly property tax will be less than if you paid every month.

Will this help my mortgage?

No, but you should see whether or not this calculator will be helpful in determining the cost of buying a home. Property taxes are paid by the owner of each home (the property is the home).<|endoftext|>This is a classic book which, for those who are interested in the subject, should be required reading in many undergraduate English departments.

This is a classic book which, for those who are interested in the subject, should be required reading in many undergraduate English departments. One of the reasons for which the book attracted such wide interest throughout the English community was the emphasis on the subject given in its preface. The author states in his preface that he had 'always loved the ancient Greeks, but a general admiration for them was tempered by real admiration for the Greeks of today.' In fact, he was particularly fond of their modern-day counterparts, such as the Italians, the Germans, and the British. That is really the crux of this book, the Greeks of today, not merely in the modern European sense, but more specifically those who call themselves Greeks, or at least claim to be such.

The United States has been forced to suspend negotiations on a free trade agreement with South Korea.

The US Trade Representative's office acknowledged in its press release that "the Administration is in the process of examining new proposals from Korea regarding the terms of an additional term, schedule, and scope of participation to the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement." This does not mean that the Korean government will agree to the new terms, or that the USTR is willing to make concessions.

The USTR's release further explained that "the Administration remains open to negotiations on the revised text" and that it is in contact with Korean officials to facilitate the outcome. It is not clear whether the White House, led by a Republican, is committed to changing its position.

Korean negotiators have stated they are willing to negotiate a deal that "delivers on its objectives" and to keep the deal within its stated goals, such as eliminating tariffs. The United States has made clear that it does not want to create a trade war that could cripple Korea's economy.

However, it is conceivable that the White House could offer concessions that are too extreme to Seoul. If so, South Korean officials could accept those terms and conclude that it would be easier to renegotiate, rather than take the drastic steps of withdrawing from the agreement.

Under our current free trade agreement with Korea, the United States was able to use an Article 311 under the Trade Act of 1974, which allows it to negotiate changes to the agreement, including an extension, in a case where the USTR determines the agreement will "significantly adversely affect a substantial number of significant US importers." The act is a rare legal mechanism that allows a signatory to end a trade agreement without giving up domestic market access or tariff reductions that have already been granted.

However, the administration has made clear that it does not view this underlined provision as a shortcut toward a trade war. The White House has stated it believes that Article 311's use should be limited to matters of "serious concern to the United States," and that the issue would then be adjudicated by congressional action.

Korean negotiators would face a tough decision if they wanted to withdraw from the agreement without giving up domestic market access, which could cost the United States as much as $12 billion a year in direct and indirect market losses.

It is likely that the White House has already decided to scrap the agreement without any further negotiations. The administration could attempt to extend negotiations by negotiating amendments that are not as drastic as those South Korea has proposed. This approach might not succeed in getting the same levels of concessions as the Korean government is seeking.

It is worth noting that the USTR is not the only US trade agency involved in this negotiation. Congress has given the USTR authority over trade negotiations throughout the world, and thus has the authority to make binding decisions. The decision whether or not to bring the current deal to a resounding end, whether to continue negotiations or drop the issue, and whether or not Korea should be required to drop its objection to a modified agreement depends heavily on how the USTR chooses to exercise that authority. That is one reason some analysts question the legality of how this trade agreement came to be approved and signed by Congress.<|endoftext|>In the same way that the US is a country with many different races, cultures, social classes, colors, and genders, the UK is a country with many different races, cultures, social classes, colors, and genders. For example:

Culturally, many British people are very fond of the colour yellow, and many Brits believe in the power of the bloodline, especially the white bloodline, to be able to turn into a reptilian creature and take over the earth by the age of 25. And that there should not be any different colour or race allowed to be different, and it should be enforced with force - in the form of laws.

Culturally, many British people are very fond of the colour white, and many Brits believe in the power of the bloodline, especially the white bloodline, to be able to stop any race being different or different from themselves, such as the Scottish.

Culturally, many British people hold many different ideas about other races and genders. They believe that whites should rule, that they do not need others because they are the best, and that women should be subservient and obedient.

But in one aspect that all British people seem to have in common, they all think differently than other people on this planet.

Briton, who is often confused with Brit, is an old surname, which means 'white person'.

Brit is often used as a derogatory term that implies that you're a 'cisgendered white middle class feminist', which means you are privileged (and entitled) and therefore need to listen to the opinions and opinions of whites more than anyone else on this planet - especially the opinions and opinions of the white majority.

Buddhism is more than a religion. It's a way of life, and it deserves to be respected. And just like any other religion, it is not immune to religious intolerance and discrimination. And even more than any other religion, Buddhism has the most prominent practitioners and the most visible symbols and symbols of those practitioners: the Buddha statues. And I've been told by quite a few Buddhists that they don't like their statues as much: not because they are ugly, but because they look like the Buddha's friends.

But don't these statues remind you too much of your own friends? Is the statue the image of someone you really admired?

We have idols everywhere in society. We have paintings and statues of beautiful women, beautiful men, and beautiful dogs. But these are not the images of the person. They are images of the thing. They are images of our cultural conditioning, and of our desire to be seen and recognized by others.

We can see why people have idols. The statues, like them, are things to be admired — and to want to emulate. But the images that we create and the images that we take as images of ourselves are not just superficial; they are also often harmful.

People have idols all the time: friends, parents, animals, vehicles, politicians, religions they've followed all their lives, food they always eat, and so forth. When I was young, my friends and I had idols we had to keep up for society to recognize us. It was only when we started to have our own identity and our own stories that those idols began to lose their power.

I have a few friends whose statues look nothing like themselves, though we've known them for years.

But my friend and I are different. We do not want to imitate the people. We do not want to make people around us look like us. For people are not things. They are people. We are good and interesting because of what I, myself, am. If someone would have told you at age 13 that the person in front of you is actually the person you really want to be you would laugh in their face. (Not just because they would look ridiculous, but also because we would laugh and say, "Well, he does kind of look like me.")

We are different from other people. We are people who live our lives and we create our own lives. We are also people who respect each other, and we respect each other because we respect ourselves. We try, as best we can, not to be like, or to emulate another person or another culture.

A statue or a painting of an old friend is no substitute for living, loving, and developing yourself.

Buddhism is not just about one person, but about our whole life: about being ourselves, being alive, being free (from suffering) to live your own life, free from having to conform to expectations of who others should want you to be or what they want you to do.

In fact, the more we have idols like the Buddha, the more we reject our real selves. We think we are some mythical figure, some historical figure who came to save the world. Buddha-like figures are far more useful as a prop than as a source of true, living energy and goodness. When the Buddha came to teach, he came as someone who didn't tell stories or make movies and who spent most of his day walking the countryside. He didn't have a mansion or a car or a lot of possessions. He was simply like every other person, a humble scholar who was very determined to practice and develop the good actions necessary of him to save the world and make a difference in human life.

The Buddha never had a family, or had a spouse, or had children or a wife and children. He simply didn't need anyone. He cared very deeply and profoundly for others, and they cared for him, too. And the fact that he had no personal or family life does not mean that he did not care for himself. But it does mean that he did not need anyone to do so, and therefore that it was fine to see him as he was and to treat him as he would want to be treated.

That's the basic idea behind Buddhists who have only a few statues at home (they have their own ones in the temples to go with theirs). In other words, to have a statue, or an image from an artist, does not equal to being like the person it depicts.

We see Buddha statues in some temples all over the country. We think, "Wow, that looks just like me!" What we are overlooking is that the Buddha is neither the human being in front of him, and nor does he have a body like our body. The Buddha was one who knew very well that it's not his body which is important; it's how he behaves and how he treats other human beings (both by being compassionate and taking actions

The last time Kieren Jack and John Gibbons faced off in person, it was as opposing coaches in the pre-season game.

With two games remaining in the regular season, Gibbons and Jack found themselves faced with slightly different challenges. After a dominant two-game run, the Blue Jays could barely make it past the first round of the Amway Canadian League playoffs.

Gibbons made the decision to make a small move up the starting rotation, while keeping a hold on the No. 5 spot in the bullpen. With the regular season nearing a close, the challenge remained: Make the playoffs.

So how did Toronto fare?

On the final day of the regular season, Jack made his first appearance since suffering a knee injury on July 2. However, what a difference two weeks makes.

The 28-year-old posted a 6.10 ERA and 10 strikeouts over four innings of work. He struck out five batters and failed to record an out, allowing seven runs.

Gibbons, who was named the A's manager for the 2013 season, said he saw a "very good" outing from his new left-hander.

"Obviously, his delivery was probably a bit off, which was good," Gibbons said. "The more experience you get in any game, the better you can work on things.

"I thought the guys did get a good look at his stuff. I had a similar look. There were times there where I was surprised at some things he went to. I thought Kieren did an good job of keeping the ball down and locating."

Gibbons said it was a good mix of pitch count, variety and keeping the ball down so it wouldn't end up high in the zone.

"I've been around a long time and I've seen a lot of pitchers go through these kinds of things," he added. "That was definitely a learning experience for him, knowing this wasn't a one-game situation, where he was going to have to work his way out and try to make pitches. It gave him an opportunity in that regard."

Jack would later pick up a win during a road trip to play in Edmonton and Calgary. He would go on to strike out 12 batters and surrender one run in the five-inning game against the Hitmen.

In his first start since July 2, Jack allowed just one run in six innings against the Texas Rangers. The Blue Jays held on for a 3-2 victory, as Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion were both released prior to the start.

Gibbons said he'd like to see a similar performance out of Jack next time out against the A's.

"I've watched him work a little bit in the cage and the drills, and really, he looked like a really good pitcher," he added. "He was just missing spots he had when he was out. I think when he throws another 10 [innings] like he's done, he's going to be a heck of a pitcher. His stuff was going."

Gibbons said he expects to know more after the final game of the season, but does not expect the Blue Jays will be making any drastic moves in an effort to find pitching help.

"No, that's not going to happen," he replied. "I've never been in a situation where I've had a bunch of money to spend. We're still on pace to finish the season with some good players and guys pitching well enough for you win the AL East, but we're not going to get there with pitching."

This season has been a difficult one for the Blue Jays, as they've seen their payroll balloon beyond some of the top teams in the league. Toronto was unable to keep pace with the other contending teams in the division, and has also struggled to find players who can get quality starts.

The Blue Jays ended the 2013 season with a team ERA of 4.73 and ranked 30th in starting rotation ERA. Although the team still has good players and a promising young crop of outfielders in the system, the talent isn't translating into results.

"There's no question about it that that's the biggest thing, just consistency," Gibbons said. "In 2011 we didn't start the season very well, we lost a lot of games during that time. That was one of the biggest things, just consistency, just knowing how to get guys out when you've got to. That's been good for us all year."<|endoftext|>We are happy to announce our second annual "RUN IT!" event! The theme? "You are here to run, not walk."

In a surprising turn, President Barack Obama was given an unexpected public boost from a very surprising friend: the conservative talk show host and Fox News contributor Glenn Beck.

Not content with offering warm words about the president's health care plan, Beck even told his 5 million-plus listeners that Obamacare is already working better than expected.

"I see it every single day. Every day, a young person is walking into a doctor. Not just the old and sick and lame, but the young and healthy. Every day a baby is born in America. Every single day there's a job opening," Beck said on his syndicated radio program Monday. "That's why we're still successful. It's not because you have big ideas. It's because people have big ideas. That's all they really want."

But it wasn't all sunshine for Beck. He made the startling claim that people who have been receiving government insurance subsidies are actually in worse health than even before they got the government help.

"Why in the world is the president's health care law doing everything in its power to make it harder for people to get health care insurance?" Beck asked. "What was so good about the president's health care law that he said it was going to make it harder for people to get health care insurance?"

The health reform reform law, which has been the linchpin of Obama's reelection campaign, had some unexpected side effects. For one, insurance premiums for both the young and old jumped dramatically in the first year it went into effect. For the young, health insurance premiums rose an average of 34 percent by 2011. But the average cost of medical care for the elderly actually went down by about the same amount because of the law. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the median monthly premium for a family plan rose from $245 in 2011 to $250 in 2012, and for individuals the median monthly premium went from $243 in 2011 to $246 in 2012.

Even before the law was implemented by the federal government, health care prices and services were already starting to creep up. For example, in a survey released last year, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners noted the trend. The cost of a family health plan rose 4.3 percent in 2010 and 3.6 percent the next year, while total health care spending increased 7.4 percent in 2010 and 7.4 percent in 2011.

"The number of providers and doctors under health insurance plans has significantly increased," the N.A.I.C. said. "A growing number of consumers continue to use health insurance to receive care or to afford care that was not previously covered."<|endoftext|>I have a few things to say.

Mercedes has been trying to make inroads into America for some decades now, but the recent push into the US – with new production lines in North Carolina and Tennessee – seems to be the most notable example of its expansion of the American market.

There have also been the recent launches of the GLE coupe and GLC sedan, and the AMG GLS GT sports car. Perhaps most recently, Mercedes brought in some brand new models – including the S550, S63 sedan and SL sports car – in an effort to build interest in its model line in China. The latter, in particular, has been widely publicized.

We're hoping that this video is the real deal, because it looks like some of the vehicles that were launched recently in China have already seen the light of day here in the States.

The world is full of places where we know that the law does not apply. A place like the United States, for example, where we have a system of government that gives the government vast power, and is run by people who seem to operate according to their own rules — and to the laws that those people want them to follow, no matter what those laws say.

But then there are places where a different kind of law does apply. Places where we are not able to get hold of the kind of legal services or legal advice that our parents, grandparents, and other close friends would have given us but whose absence has taken so much of the sting out of the world. These places, where people are not well served by government — a condition that many of us have to fight every day. These places are also those that many other countries seem to have turned down.

This country, as you know, had a huge problem with the criminal justice system until very recently. You saw the problem in the aftermath of the horrendous murders in Charleston last year. That's where I grew up, as the son of a man who was part of the justice system in my hometown, of a black cop who died in the line of duty. His was a tragic case, it was tragic that his death took place only months after he'd been hired, but it could be avoided if local law enforcement could have had the proper services.

We need to do better, and we need to do it in a smarter, more sensible way — especially given the fact that in the years since that terrible tragedy, the police department from the town of Charleston has changed almost beyond recognition — the police chief had been fired, the police dispatcher had turned over to a private company — all kinds of new systems taken over or improved. Even the town's jail was opened up to private companies this year, and they're already bringing in private security companies to help keep the peace.

The problem, like many problems in this country, is the government that we have is run by people with powerful interests, and they can use their money, their power, or both to get what they want. That leads to things like the failure of the war on drugs. Instead of a national policy, the federal government was forced to take individual cases and hand them over to local law enforcement who were underfunded, overworked, and understaffed. The result was a national epidemic of addiction that has still not been really dealt with to this day, and a lack of law enforcement that keeps the people of our country subject to an increasing number of threats.

That's just the sort of thing we need to think about — a system that isn't doing the right thing, and is being run by people who aren't interested in doing what the law requires. And we need to change it, as a country, to make sure that that sort of thing doesn't happen. We haven't yet, but when we look at the kinds of policies that you and I have discussed, we seem to be inching forward in a very positive direction. Not just in terms of criminal justice reform and drug policy reform, but in terms of the kinds of things that I want to see made available to people in these kinds of communities.

Now, you don't think that the United States Postal Service should be allowed to continue being a profitable corporation?

That's right.

That we should be able to expand postal services to many more of our inner cities?

I think that's the right and proper thing to do. One area that's really important in our plan is in helping ensure that people can get the tools they need for the jobs that need to be done. The Postal Service has really been a poster-child for failure. It's become so big and so dysfunctional that the private shipping industry has taken it over, and as a result we're seeing things come to a head. Right now there's a whole lot of frustration with postal services, and you saw it in this week's debate over the sequester. There's a lot of fear and concern about how this is going to affect those communities if this kind of thing goes on going forward.

And what I'm talking about is in this budget, which I'm going to send out in the next few weeks, there's a number of items specifically aimed at those who need to be able to afford their own postal service. There's a number of things aimed at helping in terms of protecting postal workers, and some of them are very important. It was a very important thing, for example, that postal workers in Baltimore were able to have their working hours restored, under the Bush administration, at the request of Mayor Rawlings-Blake, who said that it was important for them to be able to return to doing their jobs so that they could continue to fulfill their sacred duty of delivering our mail.

What I'm thinking about is a lot of things that the Postal Service doesn't even pay attention to, that really could help

A teenager is recovering in bed after she was 'gang raped' by a number of people after going jogging near her home in Bristol this morning.

The 18-year-old, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the alleged victims, was attacked as she left her nearby school on Southmead Road, with another woman then accompanying her home.

Police were called this morning and were seen questioning men outside a car, believed to have driven the pair.

The woman who allegedly assaulted her has since been detained in a police station.

The victim had been out walking with a group of friends after finishing a sporty session at her school around 9.30am, when a driver pulled alongside them and shouted and then jumped out of the car.

(Image: SWNS.)

The 18-year-old was forced to the floor after she was kicked in the backside, with the attackers hitting her with chairs and a drink glass.

She managed to get her arm back under her skirt and then the men ran off along the road before returning with a fourth group.

Her friend then picked her up, but when she ran from the scene, the men followed. At one point a man who was lying on the pavement then grabbed her and forced her down, before she started screaming in terror.

Bristol Magistrates' Court heard how her friends tried to stop the men, but as they ran off two more groups of men then joined in.

(Image: SWNS)

Her cousin who saw the incident told police: "I heard one voice shouting 'cut' and I saw a girl who was lying on the ground.

"Her friend started crying and shouting that a man had just raped her – there were four people with her.

"The police were called as the man came back and put his hand over her mouth to stop her crying or screaming."

The court heard that one of the female victims had managed to get away from the attackers near her home while trying to call her parents, but when they arrived the men had left.

Detective Constable Gareth O'Connor said: "These have been brutal attacks, both the men involved have shown a callous lack of regard for the victim's safety. They must be identified and brought to justice for their sickening actions today."<|endoftext|>A number of studies have been published on the potential of a diet rich in dietary fiber to reduce the burden of obesity and increase survival in patients with cancer. These studies have also demonstrated a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events and cancer death in subjects consuming this plant-based diet. There have been relatively fewer studies that have examined the potential of an enriched plant-based diet to prevent and treat the major chronic diseases that are the primary causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States population. While there are some promising preliminary data, there has been controversy regarding the appropriateness and practicality of this dietary approach. A number of factors influence the practicality, cost or effectiveness of these nutritional approaches. However, one of the most important contributors to the controversy stems from a misunderstanding of the biochemical and biological mechanisms by which a plant-based diet benefits patients. Several studies have identified a number of potential biological mechanisms by which fiber contributes to improved health. However, a number of questions have yet to be answered, including: how can fiber reduce body fat/fat mass, reduce cholesterol, improve glycemic control, promote health in certain cancer patients, induce weight loss or prevent weight gain, and if the fiber improves glycemic control, what factors determine weight loss? How long will the health benefits of a fiber supplement last? How does ingestion of this fiber affect weight or blood sugar levels? How is fiber absorbed into the intestine? What determines the ability of the intestine to absorb a given fiber? These and other questions have led to a wide body of research. However, most of this research has been of short duration and/or has not looked at the potential benefits of a fiber supplement in an obese patient population. In addition, most of the clinical trial evidence that has been presented to date is of relatively short duration. This will not likely change in the near future as there is a high demand for new therapies to treat obesity as well as many serious chronic diseases. Many of these diseases also represent a serious public health concern. Therefore, it is not likely that clinical trials of a dietary regimen as a means of treatment of these chronic diseases will be undertaken again for the foreseeable future. These trials in the past have largely been performed with healthy subjects, and thus there can be no expectation that a fiber supplement can be used in these patients given the high level of disease risk inherent to these diseases.

Grimacing and sobbing in the courtroom, the victim spoke to the court that "there is absolutely no excuse for what happened to me, I made certain rules that I've kept. But I cannot explain how he managed to get into my bedroom door." The accused had tried to steal a laptop from a woman he met at a nightclub.

After pleading guilty to rape and sexual activity with a minor, the accused was sentenced to 10 years and three months in a minimum security facility, while being kept away from children. He was also given a four year driving ban and was ordered to pay a fine of about Bt60,000 for the attempted theft. The court has ruled that the convicted offender will also have to compensate the victim for her medical expenses as well as her counseling costs.

The court also ordered the man be made to follow sexual harassment laws.<|endoftext|>This week, Donald Hormelman, a co-founder of the iconic Los Angeles-based nightclub "The Sunset Strip," passed away suddenly, as has been reported. In 2006, he was a regular at Sunset Strip. On the Sunset Strip, we all knew who Hormelman was. In fact, he was well-known by this point to a host of locals, including me.

Hormelman started as the musical director of "The Strip's" popular "L.A. Cabaret." Eventually he became a major contributor to Sunset Strip. As its general manager and promoter, he presided over the establishment's greatest years. In a 2006 story titled, "Gone but not forgotten," The Los Angeles Times described Hormelman:

The Strip's L.A. Cabaret has been shuttered since October, though Hormelman remained a major force on the club's front lines. As the city's marquee live entertainment destination, it was here that Sunset Strip honed its live music act and pioneered new types of music, ranging from ska, funk and Latin to disco and blues.

In the late 1970s, as L.A. was in the cross-hairs of the AIDS epidemic, Hormelman was one of the first to offer free HIV tests on the Strip. His testing, at the time, included bloodwork. While I don't know of any specifics, it seems likely that one of the reasons Hormelman was known around town for his AIDS activism was his free testing program. That being said, that didn't make him an enemy of the LGBT community, as The Advocate's Scott Thomas describes:

In recent years, he has also started a free AIDS testing clinic. His message has been a consistent presence around town. People tell me about their HIV test. I think it will always be a part of people's lives, especially given how HIV is still so new.

I'm told that Hormelman's most important work as Sunset Strip founder has been his commitment to maintaining a gay night life. It's a commitment that can be seen even today, when the former club continues to thrive in the South Bay of Los Angeles.

The Strip was famous on the Strip of the West Coast as the place to go to party, but on the Strip in L.A., it was the only place to go from 7pm to midnight. Even back then, after the club's closing in 1984, Sunset Strip did much more than just close, it began to be forgotten about completely. Only recently did it become a destination again. I'm told it's hard to explain but that it happened from 2002-2010. But the strip was really known from its inception.<|endoftext|>The video above shows the moment a passenger accidentally got his hand on the wrong end of the iPad mini in a Southwest flight.

According to reports of the incident, the passenger's "hand went towards the iPad, which then had the flight attendants running around grabbing it."

The unnamed flight attendant then got the iPad back from him.

Passengers on the flight said that the passenger "started to cry and told the crew that this wasn't in normal use."

One passenger, who took the video, said that the flight attendants made all attempts to get the iPad returned to its rightful owner.

The two passengers on the plane are reported to have gotten into a conversation after the whole incident went down, and were allowed to leave the plane without further action by the crew.

In a statement, Southwest Airlines apologised to the passenger, stating that the company was "aware of the concerns this incident has caused." It added that it "has been in communication with" the customer regarding the matter.

The airline added that passengers would need to sign in and sign out of the iPhone and iPad, according to ABC News.

The airline has asked passengers to inform flight attendants that the device they just brought aboard is an additional device and therefore cannot be used unless the crew provides clearance.

Southwest and Apple have been in talks for more than a year over the issue of passengers carrying electronic devices onboard planes.

"We should have no problem if they don't play. If we do play they should be able to play, we know that."

"So I'll tell you the story of my life. We grew up in Philadelphia, the same way we grew up in Boston. You don't grow up in a city, you grow up in parts. We lived in a neighborhood called Park West. I was there from the time I was like 5, 6 years old until I moved to California. I've never ever moved out of that area that is called Park West."

—

"We had a very good relationship with them. And so the second we found out that the Sixers had lost and they were losing and we were losing, that was it. In that moment, we decided we were going to take care of our own business. They don't represent Philadelphia."

"The people in Philly that made decisions, that took the decisions, I'm not questioning those people. But I was never one of those people. And yet for whatever reasons, for whatever reasons, that's where the organization was headed."

—

"We're very upset that they can't play in the game, but there's been no communication on that front with us. It just blows my mind. If, in fact, it's the case that they cannot play, then fine, we'll go home. But that they're not playing, no."

"Now, we would have loved to keep them out there just because we have a number of players that we'd like to see play."

I think the fans in Philly should be disappointed that they missed a chance to see Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons play in front of 40,000 or 50,000 fans as the Sixers prepare for Monday night's meeting with the Pacers.

I think the fans should also expect the usual back and forth between the Sixers management and their fans.

I think there needs to be a meeting between Joel Embiid and Brett Brown to resolve the conflict over Joel's playing time.


No matter how frustrating the frustration will be on a day-to-day basis, the fact remains that Joel Embiid could have played and the Sixers did not.


"They have a game tomorrow because we had an event yesterday," head coach Brett Brown said Saturday of when the team returned to Philly. "And that's something that I personally will look at that and decide how to move forward."

But let's just be real here: the most likely scenario is that no matter how uncomfortable Embiid looks during the regular season, and the most likely scenario is that the team has no choice but to release Embiid because he is not healthy, then there should be an open meeting with Embiid and Brown.

And just between you and me, if my guess is right and the reason the Sixers decided it's in the Sixers' best interest to not play Embiid is because they feel like he is not contributing, then this should NOT be a front and center story.


The biggest reason why people are so upset about Embiid's absence is because for the past few years the idea has been talked about that having Embiid in the starting lineup alongside Ben Simmons is the best way to get the most out of both players.

Well, according to K.C. Johnson of the Atlantic City Sentinel, that may not necessarily be the case. K.C. Johnson:

A source familiar with the situation said the team's general manager will discuss it after games and would prefer Embiid on the court with Simmons and rookie second-round pick Dario Saric for two hours every morning. Brown and Embiid have an understanding, the source said. At some point, Embiid will probably make his own decision on whether he wants to be at practice during the day and watch his friend play in front of him, or sit and watch from the stands.

You can get some insight into where the Sixers might go for their starting line-up by analyzing the numbers of their stars.

As much as I think there is truth to the notion that Embiid being on the bench and Simmons and Saric being the starting five is the way to go, I think if Embiid, Simmons, Saric, Covington, and Hollis Thompson can all fill the void that the Sixers have lacked, I don't see how this is a bad idea.

The good news is that Joel Embiid is doing his part in growing, which is something that hasn't been the case in Philly for a while.

The bad news is the Sixers can't seem to get Embiid on the court.<|endoftext|>The federal government has introduced new regulations with the aim of improving safety for the transportation of hazardous substances and pollutants on our highways. This requires all drivers on Canadian

If you're a big fan of Apple's MacBook Pro, then you might want to wait one more day before the wait ends. An Apple Store spokesperson said it may be weeks, or even months, before Apple's new laptop goes on sale.

An Apple Store spokesperson said during an interview on 8to5Mac that the company's newest Macs are expected to be delivered in October or November.

This is disappointing news for Mac fans who have been waiting for Apple's new notebooks since the company released the first MacBook Pro 13-inch late last year. Apple launched the MacBook Pro earlier this year, although the Pro 13-inch was delayed.

The Pro 13 was expected to launch in October, but now is expected to be on top of the new MacBook Pro line sometime towards the middle of next month.<|endoftext|>By John Walker on April 25, 2014

What is it about a good "scary" story, and a truly terrifying "dark" story, that makes them so popular in the horror genre? They're fun, and they're fun to write. Both stories could be considered "puppets": there are very few things more terrifying to most readers than those very real, very specific things they just can't handle. There is something about the ability to evoke fear with such specificity and with such speed and ease that works as both the basis for the story itself, as well as the story's most important tool.

A good "scary" story is an easy sell. When you put two stories together that are actually about the same thing – horror – but are at odds, and when the horror is portrayed in terms of the actual and immediate threat to the characters, then readers instinctively gravitate toward the stories that are the closest to being nightmares – the stories where real fears are exposed in ways that they haven't been in a long time.

"The only good monster is a true monster." (The classic Dracula story)

In my next post, I think I'll talk about one of the most popular "scary" stories of all time, the most popular of all time. What we are about to discuss relates to the classic and ubiquitous "creep story": the terrifying and mysterious stranger who will show up at the end of your stories, and then make you turn the page over and see what horrifying thing he wants with you.

In this case, my guest is George Langelaan who is the author of these very scary stories: Monster Hunter, Horror at Castle Hill, and of course, The Werewolf of Castle Hill. George Langelaan is a master at the scary story – the sort of story where you really feel like you're on the edge, at the extreme end of what should be horror, and in the middle of something much more horrifying than you expected to see.

When did "scary" stories start becoming such big and popular? And what do you think they represent that the more "realistic" horror stories don't?

John Walker: George Langelaan is a master of the scary story, and he is an author who is especially adept at crafting scares and getting readers to engage with his scary stories – even though in most cases the actual horrors we are witnessing are very mild and/or far away in comparison to most of the monsters that are portrayed in his horror fiction. My personal favorite of Langelaan's story collections is Monster Hunter, because Monster Hunter is a collection where Lomalaan uses the very literal language of the scary story to portray the most frightening of horrors – monsters – on a very personal and primal level.

I think the first "scary" story I ever heard, was actually in a horror anthology: the "Monster of the Week" story, written by a guy named Richard Matheson called "The Thing on the Doorstep." The story is really the quintessential "scary story," and it works so well in that format because it is so chilling and so realistic, that when you read the final paragraph – that is the end of "The Thing on the Doorstep" – you get goosebumps. The fact that it is that short – a story that runs from a few sentences to a few pages – and that Matheson is able to get that kind of emotional payoff is what really sets "The Thing on the Doorstep" and the "Monster of the Week" stories apart. It reminds me of a song by Jethro Tull:

"Monster on my doorstep, you creep!"

In order to find out more about this master of the "scary," I was curious to talk to John about what makes a "scary story." John, you are an author with a great deal of writing experience, and in this interview you mention how you are quite the "film geek" and how a movie is a "sort of movie in your head." And I wondered, which film in your brain would you most like to turn into a horror movie?

A new study reports that the human heart and brain are wired not only to share thoughts — but also action.

Previous research reveals that both the human heart and brain are wired to cooperate to help us survive. Brain-to-brain communication may have a role in our ability to learn, to remember, and even to create art.

Now researchers find that the brains of primates have been wired to coordinate actions in the womb. A team led by UC Berkeley neuroscientist Paul Fletcher, Ph.D., and including graduate student and first author John-Dylan Haynes, found that the activity of the fetus' brain areas responsible for coordinating movements, coordinated with the actions of the mother's brain areas responsible for planning movements. These "micro-movement" networks in the brain may have evolved in response to changes in the neural wiring during brain development. The brains of primates also show evidence of inter-regional brain connections. The authors say this study can help shed more light on the evolutionary origin of brain networks, and on our relationship with the environment.

"We found a similar pattern of network connectivity in the human brain during early brain development of the mother and her fetus as we did during early brain development of our own species that led to the common ancestor of modern humans, chimpanzees and bonobos," says co-author Fletcher. To better understand these connections, the team plans to use brain imaging technology and other sophisticated techniques to study the brains of more humans and chimpanzees in the future.

The research was published online today, March 2, 2013, in the journal PLOS Biology.

The brain is constantly changing during development, which means we will be able to learn much new information as our brains change, the authors say.

"These changes may be the reason that we become adept at solving complex problems and why, even after decades of living in the same environments, our brains may retain some of the traits of our common ancestors," says Haynes.

Fletcher and Haynes are members of a team that included University of Oxford anatomist Joanne E. MacInnes, Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley neuro-scientist Michael R. Marlowe, Ph.D., and UC Berkeley neurophysician and neurosurgeon Richard W. Damasio, M.D., Ph.D., all of UC Berkeley; and UC Berkeley doctoral student Andrew B. Pimlott.

The findings suggest that "the human brain evolved to accommodate the requirements of complex social interactions," the authors write.

To study the patterns of human brain activity during early brain development, Haynes and Fletcher used an MRI scanner to measure the connections between the brain areas responsible for coordinating eye and ear movements and those responsible for coordinating movements of the entire body. The scientists also took skin biopsies of each fetus at nine and 28 weeks of gestation as well as postmortem brain scans from two non-human primates at eight and 14 weeks.

In all three species, the researchers were able to find a large, non-overlapping pattern of neural activity that synchronized with the movements of all three limbs.

In the human fetus, for instance, connections between areas of the brain responsible for coordinating the body movements and those responsible for coordination of other parts of the body — such as movement of the eyes — were highly synchronized at the nine week gestational age. The researchers found that these neural activity networks were also more or less synchronized when the brains of the fetus were 10 weeks of gestation. By 14 weeks of gestation, the researchers detected that these network patterns of brain activation were also more or less synchronized between the brain regions that regulate body movement and the regions that regulate eye movement and other sensory information.

"It's intriguing to think of the fetal brain doing something quite different from its adult counterpart when it makes these very, very sensitive decisions," says Haynes. "The question is, are we ready to use this information to design better algorithms to make better decisions, and to make better decisions at all? It's not something we can ask now, with a child's brain and its development."

Fletcher explains that the fetal brain is still relatively immature. "Now that we get into our postnatal years, we should be looking beyond the neural systems that regulate human behavior and start to look at all these complex systems that contribute to our life — to our health, cognitive ability and emotions," he says.<|endoftext|>Rochester Police are investigating a shooting that happened about 11 p.m. Wednesday (Aug. 31) on the 400 block of South Park Street.

That left six undrafted rookie free agents still available on the Saints roster.

To determine each of the six undrafted rookies who will be active this Wednesday versus the Indianapolis Colts, let's take some time to break down each player's 2016 potential in an attempt to determine whether he can make an impact.

If they each continue to perform the way they had in college this season (which means staying healthy and productive) this group could potentially be in line for a roster spot after training camp.

1. Tim Wright, Defensive End, Iowa

Wright was actually a sixth-round pick in 2015, but was released in August and went undrafted. He was not re-signed or signed this offseason. It's not easy to make it up as a sixth- or seventh-round pick for the NFL. While it's possible Wright could earn a roster spot in training camp, the expectation is he's a practice squad member who can contribute as a depth piece.

2. Joe Grant, Offensive Tackle, Georgia Tech

Like Wright, Grant was an offensive tackle coming out of college who was cut by a number of teams at different points last off-season. Grant is still a raw player, but he has the physical traits that a lot of teams like in an offensive tackle.

3. Josh Carraway, Wide Receiver, Louisiana Tech

Carraway was a former wide receiver who didn't live up to expectations at the NFL level. He's a long-striding receiver who could make an impact as a possession receiver in the NFL.

4. J.P. Holtz, Tight End, Stanford

Holtz has some of the best hands in the NFL and is a good blocker on the outside. He's the type of athlete that has a chance in the NFL, but probably not as a rookie. His development has been slow, but if he can't make the roster right away or earn a roster spot in training camp, he can earn a spot later on.

5. Kenny Justice, Safety, San Jose State

Justice is considered more of a deep safety than an inside backer in today's NFL. He can cover tight ends, wide receivers and running backs. While Justice has a little better speed than expected, he doesn't have enough athleticism to consistently make a big play.

6. Trey Hendrickson, Cornerback, Kansas State

Hendrickson was a fourth-round pick in 2015 despite being undersized. The 6-foot-0, 197-pounder was inconsistent in the NFL last season, but might be good enough to stick on the roster as a sixth or seventh-round safety.

7. Tyler Matakevich, Wide Receiver, Penn State

Mataketvitch was a fifth-round pick last season and is a big receiver, who could earn a roster spot as a sixth or seventh-round option. He is a good receiver, but not a great deep threat and might not be able to separate from defensive backs for most of his career.

The six undrafted rookies I have listed above are far from guaranteed to make the team. There is still the possibility they could end up on Injured Reserve, or another team could sign them and make it to the 53-man roster before they're needed.<|endoftext|>From the opening moments we learn that our protagonists' pasts have been upended when they get knocked back into the past by mysterious attackers.
